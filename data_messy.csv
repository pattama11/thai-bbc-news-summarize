0,The Thais caught up in the Israel-Gaza war,"In a village lying close to the Mekong River, Weerapon ""Golf"" Lapchan sits in the centre of a group of Thai elders as they tie white threads around his wrists and chant. They are literally calling his ""kwan"" or spirit back to his body, after his narrow escape during the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October.The 34-year-old is one of more than 25,000 Thais who were working on farms and orchards in Israel when the Hamas militants stormed in from Gaza. At least 30 Thais were among the 200 or so foreign nationals who were killed in the attack. Now the Thai government is helping others, thousands of them, to return home. Thailand provides almost all the foreign farm labour in Israel. And there have been warnings of dire consequences for the country's agricultural economy if large numbers of Thais choose to stay away after the Hamas attack. Many of the Thai workers have to borrow money to go to Israel and now they are returning, jobless and in debt.  Yet some like Golf never want to go back. On the morning of 7 October, when Golf and his co-workers saw rockets being fired, and then intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome defence system, he says they were not unduly worried. Golf had been working at an orange orchard in Yesha, just 5km (three miles) from the border with Gaza, for nearly a year. He had experienced rockets flying overhead before. When they heard gunfire, however, they realised it was more serious, and hid most of that day. In the evening, says Golf, the Hamas attackers returned, throwing grenades and setting the rooms where they were hiding alight. He and 11 others made a run for it. ""We jumped over the wall, and they shot at us from behind. Bang, bang, bang, bang."" He says he was wearing only a pair of red boxer shorts when he ran to the middle of the orchard. He and the others crouched down, turning off their phones so the attackers couldn't see the light. ""We were all shocked and kept quiet all night - so quiet that we could hear the falling leaves,"" he says. The international victims of Hamas' assault on IsraelWhat is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?How Hamas staged lightning assault no-one thought possibleGolf was brought back to Thailand on a government-organised evacuation flight on 13 October. He has decided he will not go back, no matter what he might be offered. Death was just seconds away that day, he says. All 12 of them have decided that they never want to face that again.At least 19 Thai workers are believed to have been abducted by Hamas, with many more still missing.  In another village to the north, Narissara Chanthasang has had no news of her husband Nattapong since the morning of the attack. He had phoned her to tell her there was shooting, and that he was running away.He left her and his six-year-old son in June last year to work on an avocado and pomegranate farm in the Nir Oz kibbutz, not far from where Golf was working. Nir Oz was one of the communities worst affected by the attack. One in four of those who lived there are believed to have been killed or kidnapped by the militants, including many children. Narissara's only hope is that Nattapong may have been abducted, although he is not on the government's list of Thai hostages. People have always moved away from north-eastern Thailand in search of work. The mainly rural region is one of the poorest in the country, where rice farming provides only a bare subsistence living and well-paid jobs are scarce. More than 80% of Thai workers in Israel are from the north-east. They started going to Israel in the 1980s and the arrangement was formalised in an agreement between the two governments in 2011. It has not been without controversy. Human rights and labour groups have in the past complained about the Thais being overworked in unsafe conditions. People told the BBC they have to pay significantly more than the official fees of around 70,000 baht ($2,100) to get to Israel - often up to 120,000 baht including extra costs and unofficial payments. But they also say they can earn seven to eight times more than in Thailand. Some praised their Israeli employers for looking after them and paying them on time. ""Partly it's about improving their social status,"" says Poonnatree Jiaviriyaboonya, an anthropologist at Nakhon Phanom University. ""Those who came back from working overseas get more respect. They seem more cosmopolitan, more educated. But in reality, [they] are still poor migrant workers, poor rice farmers who have been neglected by the government. We need to shake up our policies for developing this region so people do not have to leave their families and go overseas.""The debts they have incurred are a worry for those who have come back early. They borrow money against their land or their house - and they normally work in Israel for at least five years, so they can pay off what they owe. Golf's younger sister took out a loan for him to go last year. Narissara's mother mortgaged her rice-fields to raise the 200,000 baht they needed to send Nattapong to Israel.This is weighing on the mind of Anusorn Kamang, a 25-year-old whose mother also mortgaged her land for him to go to Israel. He spent a harrowing few days under constant rocket attack at the organic vegetable farm where he was working, before borrowing more money for his flight home. The Thai government has promised to reimburse that cost, but his mother's debt is still there, and he is thinking about going back, once the fighting stops.""I earned a lot in Israel, and my employer was good to me. Working here won't get me anywhere. It's enough for food, but that's all. I want a house and a car. I have none of that yet.""Follow live: Latest updatesExplained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictHostages: Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?Gaza: Dead and wounded strain Gaza hospitals as air strikes intensify"
1,Catfishing: How I hunted down the gang impersonating me online,"James Blake, an entrepreneur and owner of a digital marketing agency, happily admits that he spends his life online 24/7. But he learned first-hand about the dark side of the web and how even things we understand well can turn our lives - and our identity - upside down. His story of scam artists and impersonation has been turned into a documentary for BBC Northern Ireland - Hunting The Catfish Crime Gang. Below he talks about his journey to making the film.I eat, sleep and breathe digital. It's the connectivity; the immediacy and international business possibilities of social media that I love.But a couple of years ago my relationship with the internet changed forever.I received a message to say someone had come across a fake account of mine - it had my name and my face. But it wasn't me.I thought it was amusing at first but, slowly, more and more of these impersonator accounts kept popping up. Soon there were complex profiles, using all my images with thousands of followers. They had pictures of my car, my friends, my family, our offices and my team.But things were to get worse. Soon after, I received messages from people who had been scammed and lost money. Every day I would wake up to three or four messages from women who were supposedly dating me. One woman said she had been seeing me for six months after we met online; a couple of women contacted me saying they had lost £1,000 and one even said she had lost £50,000. I started to worry because it was getting out of control.I'd been reporting the fake profiles to the platforms and doing everything I could to take them down but it wasn't stopping. I wanted to find out more about how this can happen and how to bring it to an end, for good.This documentary - Hunting the Catfish Crime Gang - made that possible. During filming, I met some of the women who have been in contact with accounts using my pictures.I don't get nervous very often, but when I went to the park to meet one of the victims I was really anxious - I was well aware of the impact this would have had on their life. I sat with a scam interceptor as a live telephone scam took place and thankfully the elderly lady on the other side of the phone was warned before she lost anything. It really was something to hear the relief in her voice that she was okay.My journey took me all the way to Thailand to see the giant complexes that exist to facilitate these scams - I was blown away by how sophisticated the whole operation is. There's millions of pounds invested into the infrastructure of these operations. I imagined these people operating out of a shack somewhere that barely has internet, not somewhere that wouldn't look out of place in Canary Wharf. I also discovered that those involved in the scams are themselves often victims - trafficked into these compounds with no choice but to carry out the demands of those in charge.I hope the documentary will open people's eyes to what's going on - the horrific reality is that there is a hierarchy of victims involved. Once you watch the film, I don't think a single person will be able to look at a fake profile the same way again. I also hope it helps raise awareness to these scams so that people are more alert to the dangers online.  Anybody could become a victim to this and the shame needs to be eradicated because the more people who come forward and share their story, the closer we get to stopping it.Hunting The Catfish Crime Gang will be on BBC Three on Monday 23 October at 21:00 BST and BBC One/BBC One NI on Tuesday 24 October at 22:40."
2,Hamas attack: 12 Thais killed and 11 kidnapped in Israel,"Twelve Thais have been killed and another 11 kidnapped by Palestinian Hamas militants who launched a mass assault from Gaza on Israel.Another eight Thai nationals have been injured in the violence since Saturday, said Thailand's foreign ministry.It said air force planes were on standby to fly its citizens home. There are some 30,000 Thais in Israel working in agriculture, many near the Gaza border. Nepal said 10 of its citizens had been killed.Other countries which have reported citizens killed, abducted or missing in the violence in Israel include the US, UK and Germany.Thailand's labour minister Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn told AFP news agency that some 5,000 Thai labourers work in the zone where fighting has been taking place, but that Israeli forces had begun moving them to safety. He added that 1,099 workers have registered to return home. Workers at a farm in Mivtahim, a town near the Gaza Strip, described Hamas militants storming their farm after rockets were fired in the early hours of Saturday.""The Hamas militants fired a rocket first, then they stormed our farm. I had to run and hide in my bedroom,"" Udomporn Champahom told the BBC.  Mr Udomporn was later rescued by Israeli soldiers. He said that a fellow Thai who was with him at the time is recovering from a gunshot wound ""as big as a bottle cap"" on his leg.Another Thai worker told the BBC: ""I was running and crawling underneath a truck then the Hamas pulled me out and pointed the gun at me at point blank before firing to the ground."" The worker, who declined to be named, later managed to escape.260 bodies recovered from 'horror movie' festival sceneGaza hospital deluged as Israel retaliates with strikesWanida Maarsa told BBC Thai that her husband Anucha Angkaew - who had been working on an avocado farm for almost two years - was one of those taken captive by the militants. He appeared in a video Hamas put out over the weekend. ""[The man in the video] is absolutely him,"" she said. ""I have not been able to contact him since 02:00 Bangkok time [19:00 GMT on Friday]. I talked to him just before our daughter went to sleep,"" Ms Wanida added.More than 50 countries are thought to have citizens working inside Israel.Nepal confirmed on Sunday that the 10 students who were killed had gone to Israel to work and acquire skills in an agricultural firm. One of the victims was 27-year-old Rajesh Kumar Swarnakar, whose family are in mourning in their village Madhuwan in eastern Sunsari district.Rajesh was a final year agriculture student who hoped to go to Australia, his brother Mukesh told BBC Nepali.""I was not in favour of sending my brother to Israel. He insisted to us that he had received a scholarship and told us that he would save some money to apply for Australia after finishing the programme in Israel.""Their father Raj Kumar Swarnakar felt the Israeli authorities had been negligent in sending his son for training in an area prone to conflict. In total Nepal says 265 of its students are working on various Israeli farms. Seventeen students from Nepal's Far Western University were attacked by Hamas gunmen near Gaza. As well as the 10 killed, four are being treated at local hospitals and two have been rescued to Tel Aviv. One is still missing. The Nepali embassy in Israel has said more than 200 Nepalese have filled out forms expressing a willingness to return home. In addition to those working in agriculture, another 4,500 Nepalis are reported to be working as caregivers in Israel. Separately, India said that it is working ""actively"" to bring back its nationals in Israel. According to media reports, there are around 18,000 Indians living and working in the country.Additional reporting by Phanindra Dahal in Nepal"
3,Bangkok: Parents of Siam Paragon mall shooter ask for forgiveness,"The parents of a 14-year-old boy who fatally shot two people inside a luxury shopping mall in central Bangkok have asked for forgiveness.A letter, written in Thai by the boy's father and released to the media, states the family is cooperating fully with authorities in the legal process.The boy faces charges of murder after he opened fire on Tuesday inside the Siam Paragon mall - one of the most-visited shopping centres in Asia.His motives remain unclear.In the letter the parents said their son was now in the juvenile observation and protection department as they expressed their ""profound sense of regret"".""We offer our deepest apologies to the victims, the families of the deceased and the injured from the recent shooting incident that occurred as the result of our son's actions at the Siam Paragon department store,"" the statement says.""This includes the public, tourists, business and store owners and those involved in the incident or nearby who were evacuated and troubled in any way.""It also includes the medical staff, nurses, police, government officials, whether Thai, Chinese, Myanmar or Lao and all parties affected by this incident. We greatly regret also the damage and impact.""We are deeply saddened and shocked by this incident and accept responsibility as fully as we can.""Thai authorities charged the teenager on Wednesday with premeditated murder and illegal possession of a firearm. Police said the boy used a modified pistol intended to fire blanks.His family have not applied for bail.The two victims who were killed were from China and Myanmar. Five other people - one Lao national, one Chinese and three Thais - were injured.According to Reuters, police said the boy suffered a psychological breakdown in the run-up to the shooting. A court turned down a police request to detain the suspect at a mental health facility and ordered him into juvenile detention instead, according to a court document seen by Reuters."
4,Bangkok: Two dead and 14-year-old held over Siam Paragon mall shooting,"A 14-year-old boy has been arrested after two people were killed and five others injured in a shooting at a luxury shopping mall in the centre of Bangkok, police say.The shooting happened at the Siam Paragon, one of the city's most famous shopping centres. The victims were from China and Myanmar, Thailand's police chief said.The suspect, whose motives are unclear - surrendered to officers and had been using a handgun, police said.Five other people - one Lao national, one Chinese and three Thais - were injured.One of the victims was Chinese and the other, who worked at the mall, was Burmese, national police chief Torsak Sukvimol told a news conference.Footage showed shoppers inside the Siam Paragon mall running for the exits after they heard multiple shots being fired.By the time police arrived on the scene at 17:10 local time (10:10 GMT) and were able to disarm the assailant, several people had been hit. Ambulances had to battle with the notoriously busy rush hour traffic in this part of Bangkok to carry the victims to hospital.The teenaged suspect has been transferred to Pathumwan police station. He attended a school close to the mall and had a record of getting treatment for a mental health condition at Rajvithi hospital, but had recently stopped taking his medication, Mr Sukvimol said. The headteacher of the private school, named The Essence, wrote to parents confirming the suspect was a pupil and said the school would cooperate with police.Live updates: Three killed in Bangkok mall shootingEyewitnesses inside the mall said they hid inside shops and bathrooms.Jakkraphan Nakharisi, 29, an ice cream seller who has worked at the mall for two years, told the BBC that he did not realise at first that the noises were gunshots.""There were four to five of them. And then silence. Then there were probably another two shots. Then I heard someone in my shop shout, 'There's some shooting!'""I ducked behind the ice cream tank immediately. I didn't know where to run. I thought I couldn't just go out recklessly.""He said he heard security guards escort people off the premises, before he left ""no more than 10 minutes after the shooting"".Palmyra Kownack, a 61-year old UK resident currently in Bangkok who was at the Paragon when the shooting took place, told the BBC she had been left shaken.""There was a lot of shouting and shots,"" she said. ""It was difficult to know what was happening. We didn't know if it was one person or a gang.""""We could see military walking by. We stayed there for about an hour until we finally got the all clear to leave. We were escorted out by the back exit. It was chaos with so many people.""In a statement, a Siam Paragon spokesperson expressed condolences to the victims. ""As soon as the incident occurred, the police and Siam Paragon's security team immediately evacuated customers and employees from the building, prioritising the safety of all customers, employees, and tenants,"" the statement said.Mass shootings in Thailand are rare, although gun ownership rates are relatively high for the region.An ex-policeman killed at least 37 people, most of them children, in a gun and knife attack at a childcare centre in in Nong Bua Lamphu province in north-east Thailand in October last year.In 2020, a soldier killed 29 people and injured dozens more in the city of Nakhon Ratchasima.

5,Bangkok mall: Shoppers flee after fatal shooting,"A teenager opened fire at a luxury shopping mall in the centre of the capital, Bangkok,The 14-year-old boy was arrested inside Bangkok's Siam Paragon mall. He had been using a handgun. Emergency services responded as the mall was evacuated."
6,Thailand: Leading activist Arnon Nampa jailed over calls for royal reform,"One of Thailand's most prominent political activists, Arnon Nampa, has been sentenced to four years in prison under the country's much-criticised royal defamation, or lese-majeste law. He was convicted by a court in Bangkok over comments he made during a protest in October 2020. Thailand's lese-majeste law forbids anyone from insulting the monarchy on pain of harsh jail sentences. It has been increasingly enforced since the military took power in a 2014 coup. Mr Arnon, a human rights lawyer, was the first activist to call publicly for a national conversation on the role of the monarchy in today's Thailand.The verdict follows months of public discussion of the law after the general election in May, in which the progressive Move Forward party defied expectations by winning the largest number of votes and seats in parliament on a platform of sweeping reform, including a demand that the lese-majeste law be amended. That demand was cited by the military-appointed senate as justification for blocking Move Forward from forming a government, despite the clear majority it had with its then-coalition partners in parliament. Simply proposing changes to the law, argued many senators, amounted to a threat to the monarchy's status in Thailand and could not be allowed.As a result, an alternative coalition was cobbled together, which includes many of the conservative parties from the outgoing administration. Any debate about the monarchy will now certainly be strongly discouraged.Arnon Nampa shot to prominence on 3 August 2020, when, during student-led protests against the then-military-backed government, he broke a strict taboo by demanding that the monarchy be part of wider calls for reform. It was a very risky thing to do. People have been jailed for 30 or 40 years in Thailand just for social media posts deemed to defame the royal family. Defending yourself against a lese-majeste charge is very difficult too - trials are often held behind closed doors, and defendants are put under great pressure to plead guilty, in order to get the typically severe sentences reduced.Mr Arnon's call struck a chord with many younger Thais. Thailand's king is officially above politics, and in public plays a largely ceremonial role, like other constitutional monarchs. But the Thai monarchy is one of the wealthiest in the world, and in practice can exercise great power. King Maha Vajiralongkorn has personal command over the most important army units. Much of the way the palace is funded, or uses its influence, remains opaque. Thailand's lese-majeste law explained Monarchy reform calls unconstitutional: Thai courtThai police arrest nine in sweep against activistsA week after Mr Arnon's taboo-breaking proposition, students at Thammasat, one of the top universities, issued a manifesto calling for wholesale changes to the monarchy. The next five months saw a series of increasingly bold demonstrations in the capital Bangkok and other cities where the monarchy was centre stage. Real change is not possible, they argued, unless the monarchy is also discussed.Until the 2020 protests, use of the lese-majeste law had been suspended for two years, at the request of the king. Royalists quietly conceded that such prosecutions damaged the image of the monarchy. But the open criticism, even scorn, of the royal family by some of the demonstrators prompted a rethink. By December 2020, the lese-majeste law was being used once more against the protest leaders, in particular Arnon Nampa, who has been charged 14 times. He also faces multiple charges under other national security laws like Sedition and the Computer Crimes Act, and has already spent several months in prison.The 2020 protests petered out by the following year. But many of the ideas of the youth movement behind them persisted, and were adopted by the Move Forward party for its 2023 election campaign. It carefully avoided any direct call for royal reform, but did talk about the need for a national conversation about the institution, as Mr Arnon had done, and wanted the lese-majeste law to be amended. Some of Move Forward's young candidates were themselves facing lese-majeste charges over their involvement in the 2020 protests. Some are now first-time MPs in the new parliament, where they are part of the official opposition.The senate's success in keeping Move Forward out of power means the public discussion it wanted about the monarchy cannot happen, for now. It has also quashed any real possibility that the lese-majeste law will be amended, or its use curtailed. Since 2020, 257 people have been charged with lese-majeste, the highest number ever seen in Thailand. Protest leaders from the 2020 movement like Arnon Nampan will be tied up defending themselves against multiple criminal charges for many more years. He has two very young children, who may not be able to see much of their father as they grow up."
7,Thailand: Man charged with beating his three children to death,"Police in Thailand have charged a man with beating to death his two-year-old daughter and his two infant sons.They suspect Songsak Songsaeng also killed two other infant sons from a previous marriage. The charges follow the discovery last week of the body of a two-year-old girl buried beneath a kitchen floor. Police say Mr Songsak claims to have a history of mental illness - and that he killed his children because he couldn't tolerate the sound of their crying.His wife has also been charged over the death of their two-year-old daughter. And his ex-wife has been charged over the deaths of the two boys. All three have been arrested. Mr Songsak has been married four times. Police were first alerted to a possible case of domestic violence at the Bang Khen district in Bangkok earlier this month. Mr Songsak's neighbours reported that his two daughters, aged 12 and four, were being physically abused. Police rescued the two daughters while they were home without their parents.The 12-year-old told police that their parents had beaten her two-year-old sister, which led to her death. She also helped police trace the body to where it was buried under a kitchen floor in north-west Thailand last week.Thai woman accused of murdering 12 friendsSpanish actor's son pleads guilty to Thailand murderMissing German man's remains found in Thailand freezerThai police have also charged Mr Songsak with the killing of two other sons he had with his third wife after his DNA matched with that of two infants, whose bodies were unearthed 10 years ago. His third wife had said he killed their four infant sons and gave police locations where two were buried.Police believe the two others may have been buried under an area where a petrol station now stands."
8,Thaksin: Former Thai PM's prison sentence reduced to a year,"Thailand's King has reduced the eight-year prison sentence of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra to a year. Mr Thaksin, who returned home last month after 15 years of self-imposed exile, was immediately sent to jail. He was then moved to the luxury wing of a state hospital after complaining of heart problems. Mr Thaksin had previously said the outstanding sentences, over charges of corruption and abuse of power, were politically motivated. Deposed by a military coup in 2006, Mr Thaksin, one of Thailand's most influential and polarising personalities, left the country two years later to avoid a prison sentence. His return on 22 August was assumed to be part of a wider political deal. And it was one that was meant to bring his popular Pheu Thai party together with its one-time adversaries in a compromise government. And it did that. Hours after he arrived, a new coalition government, led by Pheu Thai, voted its candidate Srettha Thavisin as the new PM.  The coalition includes Mr Thaksin's former military rivals who deposed his party in 2014 in a coup.Who is Thaksin Shinawatra? Thaksin's return seals grand Thai political bargainMr Thaksin clearly hoped for leniency as a part of that deal, and King Vajiralongkorn has responded quickly to his request for a pardon, reducing his eight-year sentence to just one. Mr Thaksin is likely to stay in hospital. In response to his request for a royal pardon, the royal gazette on Friday noted his age and ""illness"". It added that Mr Thaksin ""has done good for the country and people and is loyal to the monarchy"". However, Mr Thaksin must have hoped his sentence would be overturned, and not just reduced. His continued incarceration will limit his ability to influence his party, as it struggles to manage an unwieldy coalition in which it holds only around half the parliamentary seats. It also faces energetic opposition from the youthful Move Forward party, which eclipsed Pheu Thai to come first in the last general election. But Move Forward was unable to form the government, even after agreeing to a coalition with Pheu Thai. Together, the two parties were unable to gain the assent of the 250-member unelected senate, which is allowed to join the 500 elected MPs in voting for the Thai PM. By coming back and accepting his sentence Mr Thaksin has now settled the bitter rivalry with conservative royalists that has hung over Thailand for the last 20 years. But at the cost of being a much-diminished political figure."
9,Profile: Thaksin Shinawatra,"Thaksin Shinawatra, one of the most influential and polarising characters in Thai politics, has had his eight-year prison sentence reduced to one year. The 74-year old former prime minister was greeted by hundreds of cheering supporters as his private jet touched down at Don Muaeng Airport last month, after 15 years of self-imposed exile. He was taken to the Supreme Court, which had sentenced him based on convictions over corruption allegation charges that he says were politically motivated.Thaksin wrote to King Vajiralongkorn to ask for a pardon shortly afterwards, but the royal announcement stated that he had now accepted his crime, and shown remorse.Upon his return, he was taken to jail. However, he was almost immediately moved to the luxury wing of a state hospital, after complaining of heart problems. He is likely to stay there. Despite his absence from Thailand, Thaksin is still a significant figure in the country's politics. The Pheu Thai party, now led by his youngest daughter Paetongtarn, 37 will likely play a leading role in the new ruling coalition. A telecommunications billionaire, he was the first prime minister in Thailand's history to lead an elected government through a full term in office.He was enormously popular, especially among the rural poor, but also proved a divisive figure and was deeply unpopular among many of Bangkok's rich elite.After more than five years in power, he was ousted in a military coup in September 2006, accused of corruption and abuse of power.Mr Thaksin has been in self-imposed exile since - mostly in London or Dubai. He also owned a controlling stake in English Premier League football club Manchester City, which he was forced to sell off in 2008 after his assets were frozen by Thai authorities over allegations of corruption and conflict of interest.In the 17 years since being unseated in a 2006 military coup, the country has seen 10 prime ministers. But Thaksin has remained very much at the heart of Thailand's political dramas.Born in 1949 in the northern city of Chiang Mai, Thaksin started his career as a police officer.In 1973, he received a government scholarship to study for a masters degree in criminal justice in the United States.When he returned he went into business, and during the late 1980s began building a successful telecommunications empire.He founded the Thai Rak Thai (Thais Love Thais) party in 1998, and its rapid emergence transformed the country's politics.Thaksin swept into office in 2001, soundly defeating the old guard from the Democrat Party.Poorer voters liked his offers of cheap medical care and debt relief, his nationalist platform and his contempt for the ""Bangkok elite"". But big business also liked him for his CEO-style of government and his ""Thaksinomics"" policies, which created a new boom in a country where the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s had begun.Thaksin also won support for his handling of the tsunami relief effort after the 2004 Indian Ocean disaster, which devastated parts of south-western Thailand.Other things were not so easy. He had to face the fallout from his government's suppression of news of an outbreak of bird flu, as well as criticism over the violent deaths of more than 2,500 people during a crackdown on drugs in 2003.Thailand's Corruption Commission found he had failed to declare all of his wealth, and he was also criticised over the government's handling of the upsurge in violence in the largely Muslim south.Yet each time he faced pressure, Thaksin appeared to ride out the storm, his backing among his key supporters - Thailand's rural voters - apparently unscathed.It was his family's decision to sell its shares in one of Thailand's biggest telecom groups, Shin Corp, that led to Thaksin's downfall.The sale, in early 2006, which netted his family and friends $1.9bn, angered many urban Thais, who complained that Thaksin's family had avoided paying tax and passed control of an important national asset to Singaporean investors.Amid large-scale street demonstrations, Thaksin called a snap general election for April 2006, effectively telling opponents to ""put up or shut up"".But main opposition parties boycotted the polls and many voters chose to register a ""no vote"".Faced with the threat of further protests, Thaksin said he would step down. He did for a few weeks, but returned to office in May.In September that year, following months of political uncertainty, the military seized power while the prime minister was out of the country.Thaksin relocated to the UK, but shortly after his allies won the first post-coup elections in late 2007, he returned to Thailand.There he and his family faced a raft of corruption charges - allegations which the former Thai leader probably expected to come to nothing.But the courts - greatly empowered by a new military-backed constitution - pursued the cases against him and his family with new vigour.First his wife, Potjaman, and then Thaksin himself were sentenced to jail terms - with the Supreme Court finding the former leader guilty of corruption.Thaksin left Thailand, failing to return home for a court appearance from the Olympic Games in Beijing in August 2008, and became a fugitive.Since divorcing his wife - who now lives in Bangkok after her sentence was suspended - he has spent most of his time in Dubai.Political parties backed by Thaksin and led by his proxies have consistently won elections, but have been unable to hold on to power. In 2008, a successor party to Thai Rak Thai was dissolved by the courts in 2008, and in that year two of its prime ministers were also disqualified.After Thaksin's sister Yingluck won a landslide in the 2011 election, she was disqualified by the courts, and her government ousted by a second coup. She is also living in exile.At the 2019 election, Pheu Thai won far more seats than any other party, but was prevented from forming a government.But in May, the progressive Move Forward party stunned observers by winning the most seats in the lower house, well ahead of Pheu Thai. Its leader Pita Limjaroenrat's bid to become PM was swiftly ended, as he was suspended from parliament by the constitutional court.It paved the way for Thaksin's return, as Pheu Thai brokered a power-sharing deal with two military-linked parties.

10,Thammakaset: Thai poultry farmer loses his 36th defamation suit,"Three Thai human rights campaigners have been found not guilty of criminal defamation over social media posts. Poultry businessman Chanchai Pheamphon accused the women of posting comments in support of others he had sued. The comments were about the alleged abuse of migrant workers at his chicken processing factories. Mr Chanchai has lost all but one of the 37 cases he has filed, a record for Thailand where plaintiffs can sue for defamation quite easily. He had argued that people reading the campaigners' posts might be encouraged to go to a 107-second video, made by a human rights group, which he believed had defamed him. On Tuesday in court, the judge reached his verdict in less than 10 minutes. To find that video people would have to click on several links, he said. He concluded there were no grounds for convicting the defendants.""I can't say I am happy with the verdict because I don't think I did anything wrong from the beginning, and the plaintiff shouldn't even sue me,"" said one of the defendants, Angkhana Neelapaijit, after leaving the court. A member of Thailand's National Human Rights Commission, she faced a jail term for up to eight years. She was cleared along with Puttanee Kangkun and Thanaporn Saleelphol. It took the court nearly four years since the defamation complaint was filed to reach what looks like an almost inevitable verdict. For the defendants it has been a stressful and costly ordeal. Ms Angkhana has been campaigning against injustices since her husband, Somchai, a human rights lawyer, was abducted and disappeared 19 years ago. She has been appointed to the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances.Thailand's punitive defamation laws have long been criticised for stifling free speech. They have been described by some as a legal blood-sport, used by politicians and businesspeople, in particular against journalists and activists who publish anything negative about them. ""We've wasted four years,"" Ms Angkhana said. ""We've spent so much money on hiring lawyers or travelling costs. It's been such a trauma, it affects my mental [health] and my work. This is something that cannot be measured.The young radicals shaking up the Thai electionMany countries make defamation - publishing comments judged to damage a person or organisation's reputation - a criminal offence. But in very few is it used, and abused, as liberally as in Thailand. The human rights group Article 19 says Thai statistics show that 25,000 criminal defamation cases have been filed with the courts since 2015, in what the UN says amounts to judicial harassment.Under Thai law truth is not a defence in defamation cases. Even if what the defendant has said is demonstrably true, even if the plaintiff admits it is true, the defendant can still be found guilty, unless they can show there is a public interest in publishing.Plaintiffs do not have to convince the police or a prosecutor to take up the case - they can take their complaint directly to court, at very little cost, and Thai judges almost always take them to trial, regardless of their merits. Defendants must then take on the considerable costs of getting legal representation in cases that might last several years, and these costs are not reimbursed even if they win their case.This particular case began in 2016 when 14 migrant workers in the Thammakaset chicken processing plant complained that they had been made to work excessively long hours and had their passports withheld. The Thai authorities upheld their complaint and ordered the company to pay the workers 1.7 million baht ($50,000) in compensation. But Mr Chanchai then started filing criminal charges - 37 of them, against 22 individuals, who had commented about the case.""The cases filed by companies, such as Thammakaset Company Limited, are a clear example of businesses abusing the legal system in order to censor, intimidate, and silence criticism,"" says the UN Human Rights Council. ""We are deeply concerned that human rights defenders are facing prison sentences and heavy fines for exercising their right to freedom of expression.""For his part Mr Chanchai says he is only exercising his right to defend his company's reputation with his epic litigation. He has lost every case but one, and that one case was overturned on appeal.In a strikingly similar case, a pineapple processing company in southern Thailand filed multiple criminal and civil charges against British labour activist Andy Hall in 2013 over a report he helped research which alleged that the company had mistreated its workers. The trials and appeals went back and forth, alternately finding Mr Hall guilty and not guilty, sometimes overturning these verdicts, for seven years, eventually forcing the activist to leave Thailand because he said the endless court appearances were preventing him from working. Why young people are protesting in ThailandWhen asked why he kept going, the elderly owner of the pineapple processing company told the BBC he could not stop because he felt he had lost face. There have been many appeals made to Thailand by the UN, by human rights groups and by many Western governments, to find a way to curb the number of criminal defamation prosecutions. Quite apart from the damaging impact on people and freedom of expression, these thousands of cases clog up the Thai courts and slow down an already sluggish judicial system even further.In 2018 the Thai criminal procedure code was amended to allow judges to dismiss similar cases filed repeatedly by the same plaintiff, or which are filed in bad faith. The 37 Thammasaket cases would appear to meet that criteria. The lawyer representing the three women had asked the judge to dismiss their case on these grounds, but he refused. The International Commission of Jurists says it is not aware of any case in which this amendment has been invoked to reject a criminal defamation complaint. Strict laws against criticising the judiciary deter legal experts from explaining publicly why this is the case. But privately some have told the BBC that Thai judges are often young - you can be a judge at 25 years old - inexperienced, and trained in too literal an interpretation of the law to have the confidence to dismiss even transparently opportunistic criminal complaints. They also said a Thai cultural norm, which places a higher value on protecting reputations than on freedom of expression, may play a role here.""I am more careful about what I post online now. My social media is normally set to private, and even where I comment publicly, I am very careful about what I say. At some level I feel I am self-censoring,"" says Sutharee Wannasiri, another human rights campaigner, who won the case filed against her by Thammakaset in 2020.She won again last year when the company appealed against that verdict. But as Thammakaset has taken the case to the Supreme Court, it could take another year before she can finally be free of all legal proceedings. ""It is really frustrating,"" Ms Sutharee says. ""It feels like an obstruction of our work, our fundamental right to communicate human rights issues without fear of retaliation."""

Niall Harbison has made it his mission to save 10,000 street dogs a month and Rodney is just one who has gone viral on social media.

12,Dogs: Thai rescue pup on brink of death finds Welsh home,"When Rodney was found malnourished on the side of the road on a Thai island the puppy was just hours from death, his rescuer said. The week-old stray was rescued in Koh Samui by Niall Harbison, an Irishman who is on a mission to feed, sterilise and treat street dogs. He documents these rescue dogs on social media.Rodney's new owners from south Wales followed his journey on Instagram and ""fell in love"".Mr Harbison retired to Thailand but struggled with his mental health and addiction and said he ""wanted to do something meaningful"". He started by ""feeding a few dogs on the street"", but it quickly grew from there.The mum and daughter living with more than 70 catsDid keeping pets help humans survive?Mr Harbison, who has 588,000 followers on Instagram, is on a mission to save 10,000 dogs a month.""I don't want to log into social media and see sad news, so I try and make the dogs little characters and make it a bit happier,"" he said.One of those characters was Rodney, who was ""oozing"", ""raw"" and ""barely looked like a dog"" when he found him.""He was within an hour of dying.""After seven months of intensive care, Rodney recovered and Mr Harbison was inundated with adoption applications. After multiple interviews by the team at Mr Harbison's newly founded charity, Happy Doggo, Rodney's new home was found.Carys Hawkey and Cameron Clarke, from Church Village, Rhondda Cynon Taf, watched Rodney's transformation on Instagram. ""When I found Niall's account, I was just obsessed,"" said Ms Hawkey, a teacher.While Ms Hawkey was ""desperate"" for a second dog to join their New Zealand huntaway Khabib, Mr Clarke took a little more persuasion.However, as soon as he saw Rodney, Mr Clarke said he knew he was the dog for them. Ms Hawkey said the adoption process was ""important"" to ensure dogs are safely rehomed.Once the couple knew for certain that they could become Rodney's owners, Mr Clarke booked a trip to Thailand.It took Rodney two flights, 24 hours and a pet taxi from Paris to London before he reached his new home, more than 6,200 miles away from Thailand.""It's like he's always been here,"" said Ms Hawkey. ""He doesn't realise how happy he makes me.""However, she said the attention on social media was ""overwhelming"".There are more than 20,000 followers of Rodney and Khabib's daily adventures on Instagram. ""As soon as we post a photo, we get 400-500 comments on it,"" Ms Hawkey said. But transporting rescue dogs is not always a happy story - when Rory Cellan-Jones and his wife Diane rehomed their dog Sophie from Romania, she was left traumatised by the journey. According to the World Health Organization, there are an estimated 200 million street dogs in the world.While it may be a happy ending for Rodney and the handful of other dogs who have been rehomed, Mr Harbison admitted that flying street dogs to forever homes abroad was not the solution.Besides sterilising, he said one answer was to help provide locals with knowledge about food and medicine.""I've nearly got a Thai foundation set up and now confirmation of a UK charity, so I will be able to hire people to help,"" Mr Harbison said. At the moment he relies on volunteers but is planning to ""put structures in place and find solutions all over the world"".The next step in his mission is to build a hospital for sick dogs on Koh Samui which will be named after another of Mr Harbison's rescues to have captured the hearts of people around the world.Golden retriever Tina, who was kept on a chain and used for breeding, became a feel-good story of hope for many who followed her journey.""I have a feeling Tina has helped a lot more people than I even realised,"" Mr Harbison said.""Her life will definitely not have been in vain.""ONE MAN AND HIS ISLAND: What's life like for Flat Holm Island’s newest warden?YR WYDDFA: Life on Britain's busiest mountain"
13,Thaksin's return seals grand Thai political bargain,"When fugitive former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra made his dramatic return to Thailand there was one question everyone was asking: how long would he actually spend in jail?Now we know the answer: just over 12 hours. To no-one's surprise Thailand's department of corrections said this morning that, in order to monitor a heart condition, Mr Thaksin was whisked to a civilian hospital at midnight. He is expected to stay there, in his own private wing or floor, while he prepares to petition King Vajiralongkorn for a pardon to set aside the eight-year prison sentence on three charges imposed in his absence. This was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Bangkok shortly after his arrival.The end of Mr Thaksin's 15-year-long exile is not an isolated event. It is a part of a grand political bargain. It is being put in place, like the pieces of a jigsaw, to end the epic contest for power between the telecoms tycoon and his populist Pheu Thai party, and Thai conservative groups aligned with the military and monarchy. Both sides now face a new threat in the form of the progressive and youthful Move Forward party, which has brought them together. It is no coincidence that Mr Thaksin returned on the same day Pheu Thai's candidate was voted the country's next PM. Property developer Srettha Thavisin, was approved by a substantial majority, enabled by a coalition, which includes parties that were once Mr Thaksin's bitterest foes.Who is Thaksin Shinawatra?Thai voters deliver stunning blow to army-backed ruleThat Mr Thaksin arrived several hours before the vote suggests he was confident of the outcome. And that he knew this deal between once irreconcilable adversaries was solid, that by the end of the day he would enjoy the protection of having his own party in office. So Thailand finally has a government, more than three months after the election. But Thai people can be forgiven for thinking this is not what they voted for. It does not include the party that won the most seats - Move Forward - which was blocked by the military-appointed senate from forming a government. But it does include most of the parties from the outgoing, military-backed administration - even those led by two of the coup-makers responsible for ousting the last Pheu Thai government in 2014, and for the military operation against pro-Thaksin protesters in 2010 which killed dozens of people. For Pheu Thai's grass-roots ""red shirt"" supporters this will be a bitter pill to swallow, and many say they will stop backing the party. The new government is also likely to allocate strategically important ministries like defence and interior to the conservative parties as part of the grand bargain. Pheu Thai's past promises of reform, like amending the military-drafted constitution, may fall by the wayside when it encounters opposition from its coalition partners.Given the high hopes of a fresh new start for Thailand when Move Forward stunned everyone, including its own young candidates, with its election victory in May, this is a dismal outcome for many Thai voters.""So the people voted for the number one party, just for it to be in opposition? Then why even have an election?"", wrote one exasperated person on Twitter.""It's like winning the world cup on penalties"", wrote another. ""This is nothing to be proud of"".""I have never regretted voting for Move Forward"", said another. ""At least it showed some people's true colours. The next election will be a landslide for Move Forward!""The Harvard alumnus tipped to be Thailand's next PMThe young radicals shaking up the Thai electionThere has been angry talk of a stab-in-the-back by Pheu Thai, which initially pledged to join a Move Forward-led coalition, and of Pheu Thai selling out.But Mr Thaksin's election-winning machine was never a radical or progressive party, in the way that Move Forward aspires to be. It was a populist party with brilliantly-marketed policies, which initially lifted the living standards of previously neglected parts of the Thai population, and which, for 20 years, gave it an unassailable edge over its rivals. But it was always pragmatic, not ideological. And it has always been swayed primarily by the interests of the Shinawatra family, who have remained its main source of funding and its most important decision-makers.This year's election was the first since the 1990s that a Shinawatra party did not win the largest share of seats in parliament. It was a wake-up call. Other parties have borrowed Pheu Thai's signature populist policies, and Move Forward, with its far-reaching agenda for change, gained millions of voters, mainly at Pheu Thai's expense. Mr Thaksin and the conservatives both saw a threat from the same quarter, and decided to bury the hatchet to confront it.The new government is likely to focus its early efforts on the Thai economy, with the hope that making people feel better off will help them forget the unseemly way this coalition was brought about.But holding this disparate alliance of parties together will be a challenge, especially for the new PM, Mr Srettha. He has little political experience, is not popular with some even in his own party, and will be hostage to the wishes of the Shinawatra family, just as Mr Thaksin is hostage to his own need to stay out of jail. Hoping to get out policies with enough wow factor to win over Thailand's disillusioned voters may be unrealistic.And Mr Srettha will face an opposition in Move Forward that is motivated to show the Thai people what a poor outcome they have got from their election. The party they can't stop winning in ThailandIn the last parliament Move Forward already showed itself to be skilled at skewering the hypocrisy and false promises which are a hallmark of Thai politics. They will do it again. Earlier this month the deputy speaker, a Move Forward MP, used the entertainment budget that comes with his post to lay on a barbecue meal for 370 cleaning staff at the parliament, the first time, they say, that their work has been recognised in this way. This compassionate but clever move has now started a public debate about how Thai MPs use their expenses, showing the idealistic and frugal Move Forward MPs to their advantage. In the past it is something that Pheu Thai, with its cherished label as a champion of the downtrodden, might have been expected to think of. That it came instead from Move Forward is perhaps a sign of the shifting political sands in Thailand.Additional reporting by Thanyarat Doksone "
14,Thailand country profile,"Thailand is the only country in South East Asia to have escaped colonial rule. Buddhist religion, the monarchy and the military have helped to shape its society and politics.The military has ruled for most of the period since 1947, with a few interludes in which the country had a democratically elected government. Since 2001, Thai politics have been dominated by the deep split between supporters and detractors of Thaksin Shinawatra, who served as prime minister until he was ousted by the military in 2006.In 2023, Thailand's opposition parties secured by far the largest number of votes in national elections, as voters delivered a significant rebuke to the military-backed government that had ruled since the 2014 coup.Read more country profiles - Profiles by BBC MonitoringCapital: BangkokArea: 513,120 sq kmPopulation: 69.6 millionLanguage: ThaiLife expectancy: 75 years (men) 83 years (women) Head of state: King Maha VajiralongkornThailand is a constitutional monarchy. Maha Vajiralongkorn, the 10th Thai monarch of the Chakri dynasty, was proclaimed king in December 2016.  He succeeded his father King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest reigning monarch at the time, who died in October that year. Prime minister: Srettha ThavisinSrettha Thavisin of the populist Pheu Thai party won the backing of parliament to become Thailand's next prime minister in August 2023, paving the way for a new coalition government and putting an end to the political impasse that followed the country's May elections.The vote came hours after the Pheu Thai party's billionaire figurehead Thaksin Shinawatra made an historic homecoming after years as a fugitive in self-imposed exile.The progressive Move Forward Party, which won the most votes, was blocked from taking power by conservative senators - all of whom were appointed by the army following its 2014 coup. Thavisin's appointment as prime minister cements his party's coalition with its former military rivals.Under Thailand's constitution drafted under military rule after the coup, both houses of parliament must vote to select a new prime minister. Thailand's military has a seized power 12 times since the end of the absolute monarchy in 1932.The government and military control nearly all the national terrestrial television networks, and operate many of Thailand's radio networks.The media are free to criticise government policies, and cover instances of corruption and human rights abuses. However, a strict lese majeste law prohibits media in Thailand from reporting anything that could be deemed critical of the royal family, and journalists tend to exercise self-censorship regarding the military, the judiciary and other sensitive issues.Read full media profileSome key dates in Thailand's history:20,000BC - Evidence of continuous human habitation in present-day Thailand from this date onwards.c. 2000BC - Beginnings of rice cultivation.c. 1250-1000BC - Ban Chiang in northeast Thailand, currently the earliest known centre of copper and bronze production in South East Asia500BC - Iron usage appears.68-550AD - Funan Kingdom, centred on the Mekong Delta, becomes the area's first known regional power. 802-1431 - Khmer Empire, centred on Angkor Wat in Cambodia, encompasses much of modern Thailand.1238-1438 - Sukhothai Kingdom.

15,Thaksin Shinawatra: Former Thailand PM jailed after return from exile,"Thailand's former PM Thaksin Shinawatra has been jailed upon returning to the country after 15 years in exile. But many believe he has struck a deal that will keep him from serving more than a short period in prison.He arrived in Bangkok on Tuesday morning in a private jet, hours before his Pheu Thai party's candidate Srettha Thavisin was voted the next Thai PM. This cements Pheu Thai's coalition with its former military rivals who deposed the party in 2014 in a coup. Mr Thaksin, Thailand's most successful elected leader, has long been feared by conservative royalists, who have backed military coups and contentious court cases to weaken him. He went into self-imposed exile in 2008 after being deposed by a coup two years earlier. While he made no secret of his yearning to be back in Thailand, what kept him away so long was the various criminal cases hanging over him. But now the brash, politically ambitious telecoms tycoon is back - and was almost immediately sentenced to eight years' jail on criminal convictions he says are politically motivated. He arrived to cheers from hundreds of loyal ""red shirt"" supporters who had gathered overnight to see him, but he never greeted most of them. Samniang Kongpolparn, 63, was among those who had travelled from Surin province in the northeast, the stronghold of Mr Thaksin's party in past decades.""He's the best prime minister we've ever had. Even though I won't get to see him today, I still wanted to come to show him support,"" she said. ""I'm ok with them reconciling with the pro-military government, or else we're stuck with the senators. We don't want that.""Who is Thaksin Shinawatra?Flanked by his two daughters and son, Mr Thaksin emerged briefly from the airport terminal and paid his respects to a portrait of the king and queen. The 74-year-old was then taken to the Supreme Court where he was sentenced and then to Bangkok Remand Prison.It has been speculated that Thaksin will seek a royal pardon, and prison authorities on Tuesday said he would be able to submit a petition from jail immediately. The process can take one to two months.Prison authorities there say he will be kept in a wing with specific medical equipment, given his advanced age. He will also immediately undergo a 10-day quarantine - the first five days of which he will be confined to his room, authorities said.Thaksin's political party in the front seatMr Srettha's win on Tuesday is the result of a byzantine process which in three months has taken Thailand full circle. It began with the heady hopes of a new dawn led by the radical young Move Forward party, which won the most seats in the May election.Move Forward initially formed a partnership with Pheu Thai but the coalition now includes almost everyone but the reformers, including two parties led by former coup-makers - a deal with its sworn enemies that Pheu Thai vowed it would not do.Pheu Thai insists the two developments - Mr Thaksin's return and the coalition that voted for a Pheu Thai PM - are unconnected. Few people believe that.The party they can't stop winning in ThailandThai voters deliver stunning blow to army-backed ruleIt is true that Pheu Thai's hands have been tied by the unelected senate, a 250-seat constitutional landmine planted in Thailand's political landscape by the military junta which ruled for five years after a 2014 coup. And Pheu Thai's bargaining position was weakened by its poorer-than-expected performance in the election, when it lost a lot of support to Move Forward and for the first time was relegated to second place.The senators, all appointed under the junta, are allowed to join the 500 elected MPs in voting for the new prime minister. Their thinly-disguised remit is to block any party which might threaten the status quo - the nexus of monarchy, military and big business which has dominated decision-making in Thailand for decades. Unsurprisingly they refused to back the Move Forward-led coalition with Pheu Thai, despite its commanding majority in the lower house. When it was Pheu Thai's turn to negotiate a new coalition, its need for senate support meant it had to take in some of its former opponents.However some Pheu Thai politicians argue that the party should have held out for a better deal, by refusing to be in a government with the most hard-line conservative groups. Any minority administration formed without Pheu Thai and Move Forward would quickly collapse, because the senators cannot join normal parliamentary votes on issues like the budget.But the Pheu Thai leadership was not willing to wait. It even invited the ultra-royalist party United Thai Nation to join the coalition, whose leaders have in the past been virulently critical of the Shinawatra family and their supporters. They were instrumental in ousting the last Pheu Thai government led by Mr Thaksin's sister Yingluck. That these two factions will now sit together in the same government is a mark of how far Thai politics has shifted.In the end, for the ultra-royalists, the perceived threat posed by Move Forward, and by a younger generation of Thais demanding a conversation about the power and wealth of the monarchy, eclipsed their long feud with the Shinawatra family. For the Shinawatras, and Pheu Thai's more conservative, business-minded elements, getting into government again and guaranteeing the deal to bring Mr Thaksin back, have been bigger priorities than worrying about the party's reputation. But there are those, even within Pheu Thai, who are horrified by the cynical pragmatism of this deal. They are warning that the party will lose even more of its once-passionate grass-roots supporters - and lose, perhaps forever, the dominance it held over electoral politics in Thailand for two decades."
16,Watch: Supporters greet Thaksin after return to Thailand from exile,"Former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra landed in Bangkok on Tuesday, greeting supporters gathered at the airport before being taken to the Supreme Court.  There were cheers, speeches and songs from hundreds of his ecstatic supporters as Mr Thaksin finally made good on the many promises he has made to return. Many had travelled overnight from his party's stronghold in north-eastern Thailand to witness this moment."
17,Longleat Safari Park osteopath helps develop Asian elephant care,"An osteopath who helps care for a 69-year-old elephant at Longleat Safari Park has led workshops in Thailand about how to care for the animals. Keepers from the safari park in Wiltshire travelled to Thailand with renowned Cheltenham osteopath Tony Nevin.He has been treating Asian elephant Anne for more than a decade after she was rescued from a circus. ""We've got this whole toolbox of things we can use,"" Mr Nevin said. Mr Nevin uses hand massage techniques along with laser work and infra-red imagery to care for Anne, who has been at Longleat since 2011. He visits the safari park once a month to look after her, and has taken the skills and insights gained from his time there to teach others how to look after elephants. Mr Nevin, whose practise Zoo Ost Ltd is based in Cheltenham, and keepers from Longleat travelled to Chiang Rai in Thailand to led practical workshops with elephant keepers who work across Thailand.Osteopathy practices with the rescued elephants at the workshop in Thailand saw a marked improvement in their posture and gait over the course of a week.He said: ""I've been working with Anne ever since she arrived at the park. She had a life in the circus and that involves effectively gymnastics - and just like any person that does gymnastics, particular joints can suffer.""So as a result with Anne she's got arthritis in her hips and knees and throws more of her weight forward which then creates problems in them,"" he added. He said: ""As a species, Asian elephants are really struggling and I was really keen to use the skills I'd built up working with Anne and take those out to Thailand and be able to work with elephants there and teach vets and elephant handlers their the techniques that we use. ""Longleat's head of animal operations, Darren Beasley, said: ""Anne is hugely intelligent and renowned for being quite the character by all who are lucky enough to spend time with her.""It is a privilege to have been entrusted with her care and we're so pleased that - with Tony's help - we can share the learning and techniques honed at Longleat to provide vital support for her species across the world,"" he added.Longleat has joined forces with the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA) and the World Elephant Day Foundation to help secure better outcomes for elephants across the world. ""We are proud that our member safari parks such as Longleat are world-leaders in elephant care,"" said Dr Jo Judge, CEO of BIAZA.""The dedicated work of Tony and the Longleat keepers is a brilliant example of this - sharing the knowledge and skills they have in caring for Anne, can go on to support elephants all across the world. ""Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

18,Royal prodigal son's return stirs up Thailand,"This week people in Thailand have been distracted from the endless wrangling to form a new government by the unexpected arrival, from the US, of a cheery-looking, 42 year-old Thai lawyer, visiting the country of his birth for the first time in 27 years.Vacharaesorn Vivacharawongse is the second of four estranged sons of King Vajiralongkorn. Until now they were widely believed to have been stripped of their royal status and to have no place in the line of succession to the throne. But the succession became problematic after the king's eldest daughter Princess Bajrakitiyabha, the most plausible heir, collapsed last December. She is still in a coma and seems unlikely to recover. For years there has been quiet talk in Thailand about the possibility of one of the estranged sons being rehabilitated and brought back to play a royal role. Mr Vacharaesorn's unannounced visit could be the start of such a rehabilitation, although there has been no official statement from the palace.He is one of five children born to King Vajiralongkorn's second wife Sujiranee, a former actress whom he divorced in 1996. Mr Vacharaesorn and his three brothers, who were at school in UK at the time, were in effect banished from Thailand with their mother, and have lived in the US since then. His sister, Princess Sirivanavari was brought back to Thailand to live with her father. In the past the four sons occasionally published letters appealing for reconciliation with their father, and to be allowed to return to Thailand, to no effect.Mr Vacharaesorn has spent his first three days in Bangkok partly as a tourist, rediscovering the city, visiting temples, enjoying Thai food and riding in a tuk-tuk. He told journalists coming back was like a dream come true for him. But has also had what appear to be official engagements, meeting Thailand's most senior religious figure, the Supreme Patriarch of the Buddhist Sangha who is appointed by his father, and visiting a childcare centre sponsored by the palace. Many Thais will interpret this as showcasing his potential for royal duties. Back in the US he has been the most visible of the four sons, very active in the Thai community there and openly supportive of the Thai monarchy. He appears to be the one who is most suited to and interested in taking a higher profile role in the royal family.Until her collapse last year Princess Bajrakitiyabha was seen as the most accomplished of the king's children who are living in Thailand. She is a lawyer who had worked with the UN and been Thailand's ambassador to Austria. The King's youngest child, Prince Dipangkorn, who is 18, is believed to suffer from some learning difficulties, and it was widely assumed that Princess Bajrakitiyabha would play the role of regent, or even become queen, on the death of her father. Thai succession law leaves it to the monarch to designate his successor, which King Vajiralongkorn has not yet done.So could Mr Vacharaesorn, a successful and popular figure back in the US, fit the bill? It is far too soon to say. More likely this will be seen as an exploratory first visit, with further trips in the future to see how he copes in the public spotlight, and with the rigid protocol and sometimes Byzantine politics of Thailand's royal court. And it is impossible to know what King Vajiralongkorn's views are on this. People in his inner circle have been known to go in and out of favour quite suddenly, sometimes disappearing from public view. Whoever organised this return of a prodigal son will be doing so with understandable caution. "
19,Spanish actor Rodolfo Sancho Aguirre's son charged with murder,"Renowned Spanish actor Rodolfo Sancho Aguirre's son has been charged with murder for killing and dismembering a man in Thailand.Daniel Sancho Bronchalo, 29, pleaded guilty to the murder of Edwin Arrieta Arteaga, 44, in a Thai court on Monday.Police discovered parts of Arrieta's body at a landfill in the southern island of Koh Phangan last week. Mr Sancho told Spanish news agency EFE he had been a ""hostage""to Arrieta, who was obsessed with him. The YouTube chef went to a Koh Phangan police station last Thursday to report that Arrieta, a Colombian surgeon, was missing, local media reported. Koh Phangan is a popular beach destination known for its raucous 'full moon' parties. Mr Sancho filed the report shortly after human remains were discovered by trash collectors that morning, with more discovered the following day at the same location.Through DNA tests, police determined that the remains were those of Arrieta. Questioned again on Friday, Mr Sancho admitted to killing him. On Sunday, he led police to seven sites, where he allegedly disposed of the victim's dismembered body in plastic bags. Local media reported that investigations showed Mr Sancho had bought, among other things, a knife, rubber gloves and a bottle of cleaning agent last Tuesday, leading police to conclude that he had made plans to kill Arrieta.Mr Sancho hails from a well-known Spanish acting dynasty. His mother is the actress Silvia Bronchalo, while his grandfather is the late actor Félix Ángel Sancho Gracia.Mr Sancho's family released a statement on Sunday asking for ""maximum respect, both for Daniel Sancho himself and for the whole family, in these delicate moments of maximum confusion.""He is currently being held in a prison on the island of Koh Samui as police continue their investigation into the murder, which they allege is premeditated, and has been denied bail. The search for the rest of Arrieta's remains continues."
20,Thailand fireworks warehouse explosion kills 10,"At least ten people have been killed, including three children, in a blast at a fireworks warehouse in a market in southern Thailand on Saturday.The explosion in Sungai Kolok, on the Malaysian border, seriously injured at least 115 people and is thought to have been caused by construction work.Residents described hearing a huge explosion at around 15:00 (09:00 BST).The force shook buildings, shattered windows and collapsed roofs, sending a massive plume of smoke into the air.The explosion has also destroyed a large part of the town in Narathiwat province.The market fire has been brought under control and a preliminary investigation indicates a ""technical error"" in steel welding during construction work on the building was responsible, local governor Sanon Pongaksorn said.At a press conference on Sunday, he said the death toll stood at 10, but that it may rise because rescuers had found parts of two bodies that they could not identify.Seksan Taesen, an eyewitness who lives 100m (330 ft) from the market, said he was at home when he heard a ""loud, thunderous noise and my whole house shook"".""Then I saw my roof was wide open. I looked outside and I saw house collapsing and people lying on the ground everywhere. It was chaos,"" he told AFP. Accidents involving fireworks in South East Asia, which are commonly used in the region to commemorate big events, are not unusual. One in a factory in Indonesia six years ago killed 49 people. Another five days ago killed one woman and injured 10 more in northern Thailand. Despite public pressure to improve safety, Thailand still has a poor record of accidents on its roads, construction sites and in the work place. Enforcement of regulations is all the more challenging in Sungai Kolok - a notoriously rowdy border town where anything goes, located in a region of Thailand which is still blighted by an active armed insurgency."

22,Pita Limjaroenrat: Thai reformist leader who won election will not be PM,"Thai reformist Pita Limjaroenrat's bid to be nominated prime minister has ended, prompting outrage from his supporters after he won May's election.The 42-year-old was first dramatically suspended from parliament by the constitutional court, forcing him to leave the debating chamber.Lawmakers then agreed to block a second vote on whether he should be PM.The Move Forward party leader had swept to victory in the general election as voters rejected years of military rule.But to seal his victory, he needed the approval of parliament - which he failed to secure last week, plunging the country into political limbo.The constitutional court must now decide whether he should be disqualified from parliament for owning shares in a long-defunct media company. ""I would like to say goodbye until we meet again,"" Mr Pita said, raising his fist as he left the floor of the assembly to cheers from party allies.Mr Pita, a Harvard graduate and former tech executive, won on the promise of major reforms, including a pledge to amend lese-majeste, Thailand's strict royal defamation laws, pitting him against the unelected senate and other conservatives who say he poses a threat to the monarchy.Outside parliament, Move Forward supporters wondered what the point of the election had been.""Why ask people to go to the polls? Why don't you just pick someone from your families to be the prime minister?"" asked one man, AFP news agency reported.""Pita is not wrong at all. He did everything right,"" a woman said. Before he was forced to leave parliament, Mr Pita had said he would stop working as an MP until the court made its decision.""I think Thailand has changed and will never be the same since 14 May,"" he said, referring to the date of his election victory. ""The people have won halfway, there's another half to go.""Mr Pita needed the votes of more than half of the 749 members in parliament's two chambers to become prime minister. Last week, he secured only 324 votes, 51 short of the required 375. He had a clear majority from elected MPs in the lower house, but not from the upper house.He always faced an uphill battle, as there was little evidence that the 249 upper house senators would support him. They were all installed by the military leaders of a 2006 coup as a brake on any democratic outcome that the military and royalists were uncomfortable with.Move Forward is popular among young Thai voters who wanted to end nearly a decade of conservative military rule. Art Chaturongkul, a 39-year-old living in Bangkok, said he and fellow supporters are deeply concerned as they see Mr Pita as representing their voices in the parliament. ""I'm filled with mixed emotions. Utter rage, frustration, and disappointment. It feels like a setback to the democratic process,"" he had earlier told the BBC.Move Forward has formed a coalition government with seven other parties, including Pheu Thai, the second most popular party in the May election.Many young voters switched to voting for Move Forward because Pheu Thai had been unwilling to rule out doing deals with the military. Pro-establishment campaigners have sought to block Mr Pita from taking the reins of power after the shock election results in May. Two cases have been filed against him in the conservative-leaning Constitutional Court. Alongside the one for which he was suspended, the  other complaint claims Move Forward's proposal to amend lese-majeste laws - which have seen hundreds of critics of the monarchy jailed - amounts to an attempt to an overthrow Thailand's entire political order.There is a precedent for what is happening now. In the 2019 elections, Future Forward - the predecessor to Move Forward - was dissolved by the Constitutional Court after it was found to have violated electoral rules. Since 2008, it has also dismissed three PMs aligned with former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who was toppled by a 2006 coup. Ironically his party, Pheu Thai - which has been on the receiving end of nearly all of the Constitutional Court's rulings - is now poised to benefit from this latest ruling against its coalition partner. There is no love lost between Pheu Thai and Move Forward, particularly as the former has taken the latter's mantle as a champion of democracy.But despite winning the election, Mr Pita may have to accept not only giving up the top job, but having no place at all in the new government.Additional reporting by Jonathan Head "

25,Prayuth Chan-ocha: Thailand coup leader departs the stage,"Prayuth Chan-ocha, the army chief who overthrew an elected government nine years ago, and has run Thailand ever since, has announced he is retiring from politics. General Prayuth contested the May general election as prime ministerial candidate for a new conservative political party, but it performed poorly, winning just 36 out of 500 seats in parliament.He was known as a straight-talking, ultra-royalist army commander when he seized power on 22 May 2014 in a skilfully-choreographed coup-d'etat which ensured there was little organised opposition.Unlike what happened after a previous coup eight years earlier Gen Prayuth stayed in power, giving himself the job of prime minister. Despite promises that his tenure was only temporary, he has remained in the job ever since, and profoundly reshaped Thailand's power structures. His military government pushed through a new constitution in 2017 which ensured that the coup leaders would extend their influence, largely through a  250-seat senate which he appointed, even after returning to democratic rule. Today that senate, made up largely of conservative royalist men like Gen Prayuth, still has the power to block the reformist coalition which won a clear majority in the recent election.Gen Prayuth was a gruff, sometimes irascible leader, unaccustomed at first to having his decisions questioned by journalists, who he once jokingly threatened to have executed.He deployed his fondness for singing after his coup by penning ballads promising to return happiness to the people, and was visibly frustrated when that failed to happen. His was a relatively light-handed form of dictatorship, but his government was intolerant of dissent, and hundreds were prosecuted and jailed under a range of military decrees and national security laws, most notably the harsh lese majeste law, which was used extensively against those who questioned the role of the monarchy.Gen Prayuth remained personally popular with many older Thais, but became the focus of younger protesters who opposed military rule. His inability to revive Thailand's slow-moving economy and the persistence of corruption in his administrations persuaded many Thais that he and his authoritarian style of leadership had to end, helping the youthful new Move Forward party, with its promise to end military interference in politics, to a stunning first place in the last election.He may consider his greatest achievement as helping manage a difficult royal transition from the revered King Bhumibol, who had been on the throne for 70 years, to his much less popular son King Vajiralongkorn. This may well have been a primary reason for his coup."
26,Missing German man's remains found in Thailand freezer,"Thai authorities have found the dismembered body of a missing German businessman in a freezer.The search for Hans-Peter Mack, 62, reached a tragic end on Monday night as police located his remains in a garbage bag at a rented house in Nong Prue, a city in southern Thailand.Two German suspects have been arrested. Mack, a property broker who lived with his Thai wife in the eastern city of Pattaya, had been missing since 4 July.Police say the two suspects conspired to murder Mack, then transported and concealed his body.Mack was last seen in his Mercedes sedan in Pattaya, according to a missing-person notice put up by his family, who offered 3m baht (£66,000; $86,000) for information on his whereabouts.The car was found on Sunday in the parking lot of a condominium in Nong Prue, reports say.  Along with the body, investigators discovered a cordless chainsaw, a pair of hedge clippers, and rolls of plastic, according to footage aired on Thai television channels.Police also found traces of what is believed to be a cleaning solvent on the seats, dashboard, steering wheel and other areas of the car.Police Major General Theerachai Chamnanmor told The Bangkok Post the discoveries suggested""intention to destroy evidence"".Nong Prue police chief Tawee Kudthalaeng said authorities also discovered that a large amount of money was missing from Mack's bank account.He added that Mack's remains were later found by using CCTV footage from the area, but did not elaborate. The local broadcaster reported that Mack's wife had called him after he did not show up for their lunch appointment on 4 July. She received a text message claiming he would call back. At about 10pm that night, she received another text saying that he was still with a client. But Mack's wife told Thai media that Mack had never texted her in their five-year relationship."
27,Thai elephant flown home after alleged abuse in Sri Lanka,"A Thai elephant given to Sri Lanka in 2001 has returned to its birthplace after a diplomatic row over its alleged abuse.The 29-year-old Muthu Raja arrived in Thailand on Sunday on a 19 million baht (£425,000; $540,000) commercial reparation flight.Bangkok had demanded the return of the animal after claims it was tortured while kept at a Buddhist temple.Sri Lanka's prime minister said he had formally apologised to the Thai king.The 4,000kg (8,800 pound) elephant was airlifted to Chiang Mai in a specially-built steel cage, accompanied by four Thai handlers and a Sri Lankan zookeeper. It will undergo hydrotherapy to treat an injury on its front left leg.Both Sri Lanka and Thailand consider elephants to be sacred animals.In 2001, the Thai royal family gifted three elephants, including Muthu Raja, to Sri Lanka's government to be trained as carriers of religious relics.Muthu Raja was placed in the care of a temple in the south of the country.Animal rights groups allege it was made to work with a logging crew in the temple, adding that it developed a stiff leg from a long-neglected injury.Sri Lanka-based activist group Rally for Animal Rights and Environment (RARE) lobbied last year for Thai officials to intervene after months of unsuccessful attempts to get Sri Lanka's government to act, the group's founder Panchali Panapitiya said.Ms Panapitiya said the failure of Sri Lankan wildlife officials to act had brought ""disrepute"" to the country, The Independent reported. RARE has also petitioned for authorities to prosecute those responsible for the elephant's neglect.Sri Lankan wildlife minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi told local media Thailand had been ""adamant"" in demanding that Muthu Raja be returned after its ambassador in Sri Lanka found it to be in poor health during a visit last year.Muthu Raja was in pain and covered in abscesses when removed from the temple last November, AFP reported. Activists claim its handler inflicted some of those wounds.It was temporarily transferred to Sri Lanka's National Zoological Garden and most of its wounds have healed in recent months. Sri Lankan Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena told his parliament in June that he had conveyed his regret to the Thai king Maha Vajiralongkorn over Muthu Raja's alleged abuse and was able to ""re-establish trust between the two countries"".The Thai government stopped sending elephants overseas about three years ago following protests from activists, Thai environment minister Varawut Silpa-archa said in June. Bangkok's wildlife department said it is monitoring the condition of Thai elephants already sent overseas."
28,Neglected Thai Elephant flown home from Sri Lanka,"An elephant gifted to Sri Lanka has been flown back to Thailand on Sunday following a diplomatic spat over the animal's alleged mistreatment. 29-year-old Muthu Raja - also known in its birthplace as Sak Surin - was moved from its temporary home at a zoo in Sri Lanka's capital Colombo before dawn accompanied by four Thai handlers and a Sri Lankan keeper. The 4,000kg animal arrived in Chiang Mai inside a special steel cage, on board a chartered cargo plane."
29,Thailand: Rescuers amputate leg of woman stuck in travelator,"A woman who got stuck in a travelator in Bangkok's Don Mueang airport had to have her leg amputated by rescuers.Her son said the family was ""shocked"" and worried about her mental health after the surgery was carried out on Thursday evening.The 57-year-old's leg got stuck on Thursday morning after she tripped over her suitcase while on her way to board a flight, local media said.""My mother's morale is quite concerning,"" her son wrote on Facebook.""We got to speak to her a bit before and after the operation... Even though she showed her strength through facial expression and tone of voice, we knew that deep down she was broken because she suddenly lost a leg,"" Kit Kittirattana added. ""Our family knows very well that we can neither make her leg work like before, nor can we bring back the same life she had lived,"" he wrote.Pictures online showed the woman - who has not been named -  in a sitting position with her left leg wedged underneath the travelator.A pink suitcase next to her had lost two wheels, while yellow comb plates typically found at the end of travelators had also broken off.Airport management said they were ""deeply saddened"" by the incident and would compensate the woman for the partial loss of her left leg, as well as bear her medical expenses.And airport director Karant Thanakuljeerapat told reporters on Thursday that the cause of the incident is under investigation.He added that the airport had planned to replace several old travelators by 2025 but may speed up the process now.Local media reported that the travelator in question had been operating since 1996."
30,Thai court acquits five charged with blocking Queen's convoy,"A court in Thailand has acquitted five anti-government protesters charged with attempted violence against the Queen.The case stems from pro-democracy protests in 2020, when a motorcade carrying Queen Suthida was blocked by demonstrators in the capital Bangkok. The court found the defendants had not intended to impede the royal convoy as it passed through the rally. Thailand's constitution enshrines reverence of the monarchy, criticism of which is punishable by long jail terms.A controversial lese majeste law forbids insulting the monarchy and is among the strictest in the world. Anyone found in breach of the law could face up to 15 years in prison.  Critics say the military-backed government uses the law to clamp down on free speech, and the United Nations has repeatedly called on Thailand to amend it.Why Thai protesters are willing to break the law Thailand's lese-majeste law explained The double-edged sword of Asia's protestsThe youth-led demonstrations, which continued into 2021, saw young activists, for the first time, demanding a series of royal reforms, including amendments to the lese majeste law. The defendants had been indicted under a separate, little-used law which forbids attempted violence against senior royals, and carries a minimum sentence of 16 years in jail. More serious breaches of this law can result in life imprisonment or a death sentence.Prosecutors alleged that the protesters had knowledge that the royal motorcade carrying the Queen was going to pass through the area, and had intentionally broken away from the demonstrations to block its route. They were indicted under article 110 of Thailand's criminal code which prohibits anyone from harming the liberty of the Queen, the heir apparent or the regent. However, Bangkok's Criminal Court concluded that no clear announcement had been made to the public about a motorcade in the area prior to its arrival, and it's unlikely the protesters would have known. Speaking to Reuters news agency after the verdict, one of the activists Bunkueanun Paothong said: ""I'm really glad... we've been fighting this and insisting on our innocence."""
31,Thailand: Exploding extinguisher kills student during fire drill,"A senior high school student has died after an extinguisher exploded during a fire drill at his campus in Thailand. Twenty-one others at Rajavinit Mathayom School in Bangkok were injured in Friday's incident, said the city's governor. Seven were taken to hospital.The explosion had sent the extinguisher flying towards the victim, who was about 10 metres away. Rescuers said the extinguisher may have been defective because of sun or heat exposure. The dead student was in his final year of school. His age has not been confirmed.Police have been investigating the cause of the incident, cordoning off the scene which remained scattered with debris. Officials added that the extinguishers used in the drill have all been sent to the police's forensics division.The exploding cannister contained carbon dioxide, according to the Ruamkatanyu Foundation, the rescue organisation on the scene.  The extinguishers are usually refilled with chemicals when empty, but ""how and where they were refilled must be investigated, and safety valves must be checked"", said the city's police chief.The school is located in the Dusit district, alongside many government offices.Ministry of Education officials have also been sent to the school to determine what happened, permanent secretary Atthaphon Sangkhawasee said.He expressed condolences to the relatives of the dead student, adding that the ministry would assist and compensate those affected, according to The Nation."
32,Thai cave rescue: Official hailed as hero of cave rescue dies,"A Thai official who oversaw the dramatic rescue of 12 boys and their football coach from a flooded cave in 2018 has died of cancer. Narongsak Osottanakorn died on Wednesday in a week that marks the fifth anniversary of the cave rescue. He was 58.He is beloved in Thailand as the ""Wild Boar Governor"", named after the football team he helped save.Mr Narongsak is survived by his wife and two daughters.HIs death comes just four months after the Wild Boars' 17-year-old captain, Duangphet Phromthep, died in the UK. Thai media reported that he had succumbed to a head injury.Mr Narongsak was the governor of the Chiang Rai province in northern Thailand where the the boys and their coach were trapped deep inside the Tham Luang cave for 18 days.  During that time Mr Narongsak coordinated the rescue mission, involving teams from several countries, including the UK, US and China. He was often seen near the site supervising what was happening, and held daily press briefings. He drew widespread praise in Thailand for his work in the cave rescue - a mission that, in his words, had ""united humanity as a whole"".""With over 10,000 people involved, even if one function was missing, we would not have been able to do it,"" he said in New York in 2018 after receiving an award from the non-profit, Asia Society.When news of Mr Narongsak's death broke, two of the cave survivors - one of whom was the coach - stopped football practice to offer prayers. ""Thank you for saving the lives of all 13 of us. May your soul rest in a better place,"" the teen said in a video later shared on Facebook. The full story of Thailand's extraordinary cave rescueCave rescue: The divers who got the Thai boys outThai boy's death shatters happiest of endingsThere were also tributes on Twitter. One user shared an illustration showing Mr Narongsak as an elephant with eyeglasses, leading a pack of wild boars out of a cave, while tossing a football with his trunk.""We will always remember his goodness forever,"" another Twitter user wrote, while a third one praised him for displaying ""leadership in a critical moment"".Mr Narongsak was last seen in public at his daughter's wedding, six days before his death. Thai media published pictures showing the frail governor, masked and in a wheelchair, as he took part in the ceremony. He had been battling cancer for five years. His funeral is being held at a temple in Bangkok, and the Thai royal family is reported to have sent wreaths and holy water to perform the bathing rites. Some of the boys from the Wild Boars will take part in a Buddhist ritual in his honour, Thai media reported.Born in 1965, Mr Narongsak was a veteran bureaucrat who had served multiple roles in public service, including a stint in the Ministry of Interior. He was appointed governor of Chiang Rai in 2017, a post he held for 15 months. The province in northern Thailand is known for its verdant trails. He was due to be transferred to Phayao, a smaller province, when the football team became trapped in the cave. But the government postponed his move so he could oversee the rescue mission. He did a master's degree in Geodetic Science, the study of properly measuring the size and shape of the earth.When he died, Mr Narongsak had been serving as governor of Pathum Thani province since 2021. He was reportedly asked to run for governor of Bangkok, but declined for health reasons."

It's really difficult to know where I belong, but I definitely feel like I belong in these groups.""Tackling common misconceptions around adoption was something discussed in the podcast.She said people think adopted people are ""these 'challenged' children and they grow up to have no jobs and they don't do anything with their lives and that's really not the case"".""I've got friends and family who support me and I'm like no other, just that I had a lot of trauma in my early years of life,"" she said.Mimi believes people need to be educated so that adopted people are better supported and know they are not alone.""I would've loved to have listened to other people's stories growing up,"" said Ellie-Rose Griffiths from Cardiff. The 22-year-old said the adopted people bounced off each other while recording the podcast and it made her feel ""understood"".The student paramedic said she felt very fortunate having such ""amazing adoptive parents who are my parents. I wouldn't call them anything else"".She now wants to encourage other adopted people to share their stories in order for people to learn more about adoption.""Once they started talking about their experiences and were there together supporting each other, you couldn't stop them,"" said Ruth Letten, manager of Connected, a service for children and young people by Adoption UK.Ruth expressed how important it was for adopted people to share experiences to ""legitimise how they feel and to help them understand that they are not on their own"".She said adoption has changed a lot over the years, moving on from a lack of support as adopted children became adults.Ruth said modern adoption was about ""placing the child and young person at the heart of everything"".""So it's making sure that we are listening to them and responding proactively to their voices and what they feel is important, rather than just assuming we know what's best.""Adopted people are now given information such as life story books which help them understand why they were placed for adoption so they can ""understand their story, so it can become integrally part of who they are"".The youth worker said, for many of the young people, it was the opportunity ""to shape and change things and to put things in place for younger adoptees"".REUNION HOTEL: If you could reunite with one person from your past, who would it be?DARE TO DANCE: 'When I dance I feel like I can overcome anything'"

35,Drug traffickers smuggling crystal meth past South East Asia security - UN,"Drug traffickers have found new ways of smuggling crystal methamphetamine, known as ice, out of South East Asia to high-paying customers outside the region, according to a UN report.Criminal gangs are moving more drugs by sea to evade land patrols in Thailand and China, making them harder to spot.They have learnt ""to anticipate, adapt and try to circumvent"" law enforcement, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime said.The ice is sold in Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.The huge trade in methamphetamines and other illegal drugs, which mostly flow from super labs in parts of Myanmar, is also showing no signs of slowing down, the UN agency warned.Shan state in Myanmar is home to what many believe is the world's largest meth trade. Traffickers ship the drugs out through the borders of Laos, Cambodia and Thailand, an area known as the Golden Triangle.""In 2022, we saw them work around Thai borders more than in the past,"" said Jeremy Douglas, the UN agency's regional representative.""Traffickers have continued to ship large volumes through Laos and northern Thailand, but at the same time they have pushed significant supply through central Myanmar to the Andaman Sea, where it seems few were looking.""The meth comes in two main forms: pills known as yaba or highly addictive crystal meth (ice).In recent years, both Thai and Chinese police, backed by neighbouring forces, have stepped up operations in the Golden Triangle. Criminal gangs use Thailand as a transit country to get high value crystal meth to a third country such as Australia or New Zealand where the street value of the drug can be 10 times higher than in Bangkok. High volumes of Myanmar meth is also making its way into Bangladesh and India, according to the report.In the last year, Thai and Chinese authorities have seen a significant drop in drug seizures. Police across East Asia and South East Asia seized nearly 151 tonnes of methamphetamines in 2022, down from a record of 172 tonnes in 2021.However, the price of 1kg (2.2lbs) of crystal meth is at an all-time low, which suggests that supplies are still high.Officials believe criminal gangs have found ways to ""diversify"" their network and move the drugs using alternative maritime routes. Thai drug enforcement agents are managing to intercept some of the supplies at sea.Earlier this week, after a four-month operation following drug smugglers, Thai authorities seized more than 900kg of crystal meth from a trawler in the Gulf of Thailand, about 32km (20 miles) from the tourist island of Samed. Six crew members were arrested in the operation.Officers said the drugs would have been transferred from the small Thai boat to a bigger trawler which would have likely taken the drugs to Australia.Authorities across the region also seized a record 27.4 tonnes of ketamine in 2022, which is an anaesthetic misused as a recreational party drug. That's up 167% on 2021.The report highlighted one ketamine laboratory in Cambodia which they said was capable of ""industrial scale"" production.It also expressed concern that Cambodia had become ""a key transit and to some extent production point for the regional drug trade"".""The discovery of a series of clandestine ketamine laboratories, processing warehouses, and storage facilities across the country has set off alarm bells in the region,"" the report said."
36,Pita Limjaroenrat: Thai election contender explains why he is different,"The BBC's Jonathan Head has been speaking to Pita Limjaroenrat, Thai Move Forward leader, about his hopes for Thailand, if he is gets into government for a four year term."
37,Pita Limjaroenrat: Thai election upstart who vows to be different,"Pita Limjaroenrat is not your typical Thai politician. In a country where the average age of cabinet ministers is 65, where unquestioning deference to elders is still a cherished tradition, his youth - he looks far younger than his 42 years - and unabashed confidence make him stand out. That he is, after a shock election result which put his reformist Move Forward party ahead of all the others, poised to become the youngest prime minister in 78 years, has stunned the conservative political establishment which has dominated Thailand for much of the modern era. Difficult negotiations are now under way to form a coalition government with Pheu Thai, the second largest party, which has won every election held in Thailand since 2001, and had been expected to win the latest, held on 14 May. Both Pheu Thai and Move Forward consider themselves to be progressive, opposed to military interference in politics like the 2014 coup, which deposed a Pheu Thai administration.But the young activists of Move Forward outmanoeuvred the older party, and beat many of its candidates, with an imaginative, social media-based campaign offering voters a complete break with the past, and a different kind of political leadership.""I'm different,"" Pita tells me. ""We are not getting into a coalition to pursue a quick fix, or to get me the prime ministership. I'm in government for the people. The world has changed. ""You don't have to be a strong man, with toxic masculinity, to make sure 'people have to listen to me, and I have to be the one in the spotlight all the time'. ""I don't have to be perfect all the time. I can just be like a regular human being here in Thailand, riding motorcycles, eating on the streets like any other people.""Pita Limjaroenrat was born into a wealthy Thai family. He cites being sent to school as a teenager in New Zealand, the time he lived in the United States doing postgraduate study, and his experience working in the family rice-bran business, and then as an executive with the ride-hailing company Grab, as formative influences. He admires down-to-earth leaders like New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern and Uruguay's José ""Pepe"" Mujica.Move Forward has the most ambitious reform agenda of any party in Thailand's electoral history.  Among the 300 policies in its manifesto are equal marriage for LGBTQ Thais, ending military conscription, tackling business monopolies, and overhauling the education system to make it fit for a 21st Century economy.The party plans to scrap the military-drafted constitution, and bring the army's many business interests under the Ministry of Finance. ""It is time to end the cycle of military coups, and time to end the corruption in politics which opens the door to coups,"" Pita says.But the party's most controversial proposal is to amend the lèse majesté law, which imposes long jail sentences on those convicted of insulting the royal family, and to begin a conversation about the relationship between the monarchy and the Thai people.Many of the 250 senators, who were appointed by the previous military government, and who are required to join the parliamentary vote for the next prime minister, say they will block Move Forward from taking office over this issue.""The sentiment of the era has changed,"" says Pita. ""I think we now have the maturity and tolerance to speak about the monarchy. Even conservatives understand what the role of a constitutional monarchy should be in the 21st Century. ""We won the votes of 14 million people. And they understood - it was clear, it was transparent - that this was one of the agendas we wanted to push.""The Move Forward leader believes that his coalition, which currently holds 312 out of the 500 seats in the lower house of parliament, will get the necessary backing of 64 senators to give them the super-majority they need.Sources inside the senate, though, say this will be difficult to achieve so long as Move Forward remains committed to amending the lèse majesté law; but that at least some of the senators, who only have a year left of their unelected terms, do feel uneasy about opposing a coalition which won a clear majority in the election.Pita Limjaroenrat is promising a new foreign policy as well. Under the military-backed governments of the past decade Thailand is widely viewed as having punched below its weight in international affairs, with Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha taking little interest in foreign policy.""Definitely we need to engage the international community more,"" Pita says.  ""We have to rebalance. We have to speak out more, and we have to side with the rules-based world order. No words, no weight in foreign policy. ""And a lot of our problems, whether its economic, it's air pollution, it's the price of fertiliser, come from the rest of the world.""His government, he says, would work more closely with Thailand's Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) neighbours to seek a solution to the civil war in Myanmar, and he would try to channel more humanitarian aid across the Thai-Myanmar border.The challenges still confronting this young prime minister-in-waiting are daunting. There is the sceptical senate, and the need to hammer out a deal with Pheu Thai, which won only ten seats fewer than Move Forward and has more experienced negotiators in its team. Pheu Thai has been demanding top ministries, and the powerful parliamentary speaker position, which Pita views as a priority to get his many new bills tabled. His party is made up mainly of first-time MPs, some too young to pass the 35 years age threshold to be a minister, some still facing serious criminal charges from their past political activism.Ideologically more flexible, and taking a hands-off approach to the monarchy, Pheu Thai has the option of joining an alternative coalition which includes parties in the outgoing administration. Move Forward has ruled out such a compromise, having won many of its votes through its promise not to do deals with the generals. Pita Limjaroenrat believes neither party can abandon what he is calling a coalition of dreams and hope, because of the damage it would do to their reputations. He wears the weight of these responsibilities lightly, still making time to spend with his family, and breezily optimistic that things will work out.""I don't want to be like those other Thai politicians still fighting for positions well into their 70s and 80s,"" he tells me. ""I want to keep doing this for maybe another ten years, and then it will be time for something else."" "
38,Thailand media guide,"The government and military control have historically controlled nearly all the national terrestrial television networks and operate many of Thailand's radio networks.The media are free to criticise government policies and cover instances of corruption and human rights abuses.However, a strict lese majeste law prohibits media in Thailand from reporting anything that could be deemed critical of the royal family, and journalists tend to exercise self-censorship regarding the military, the judiciary and other sensitive issues.Multichannel TV, via cable and satellite, is widely available. The radio market, particularly in Bangkok, is fiercely competitive. The print media are largely privately-run, with a handful of Thai-language dailies accounting for most newspaper sales.

39,Thailand election: Reformists 'confident' they will form government,"The leader of the reformist party that won Thailand's election says he is confident he will be able to form a coalition government.Pita Limjaroenrat says his Move Forward party has secured an alliance with seven other parties that give them at 313 of the 376 votes needed.More than 36% of Thais voted for Move Forward in a rejection of the military-backed rule of the past nine years.But the party is not guaranteed government due to parliament's set-up.Thailand's parliament consists of 500 elected seats in the lower house and 250 unelected positions in the Senate appointed by the military.There are fears the military-appointed Senate could block the new administration, however Pita this week has presented his party's path to government as a democratic inevitability, to counter conservative opposition from the Senate. ""We've got the momentum behind us,"" he said on Thursday, standing next to party leaders in his alliance at a joint press conference.Following its election success on Sunday, Move Forward reached out immediately to the second most popular party, Pheu Thai, to establish the basis of a viable coalition.Move Forward won 152 of the 500 seats in the lower house, while Pheu Thai won 141.Following several party negotiations, Move Forward's leader said on Thursday they had reached an agreement on broad policy issues, that would form the basis of a new government administration.He added: ""The 313 votes we have in the lower house are sufficient in a normal democratic system, and we do not need to seek any more partners.""The dramatic surge in support for Move Forward, and the clear majority won by the two main opposition leaders, has being widely interpreted as the Thai public's rejection of the military-backed rule since the 2014 coup.The 250-member Senate was created and entirely appointed by the then-military government and allowed to vote on the selection of a new prime minister - a role rejected by many Thai parties as incompatible with democracy. Move Forward and its supporters have argued that if the Senate were to use that power, it would not only go against the expressed will of the people at the ballot box, but would represent the last gasp of an authoritarian system that has been spurned by the voters.A few senators have said this week they will support a Move Forward-led coalition.  Mr Pita's alliance has been hopeful there will be enough of the others to get them over the threshold of the super-majority of 376 votes needed to form government.But other senators have refused to back them because of the party's policy to reform the lese majeste royal defamation law.Mr Pita's party had struck a chord with Thailand's young voters by promising reforms to those laws which severely punish those found guilty of criticising the royal family.But the third largest party, Bhumjaithai, which won 70 seats at the polls, has stated it will not support Move Forward because of those planned reforms. Bhumjaithai has been seen as a potential kingmaker in any new government. However Move Forward has said it has not invited Bhumjaithai to join its coalition, and argued its coalition already has a clear majority in the lower house.Move Forward has worked this week to leverage the weight of public sentiment on its side, following an election that ignited voter passion and hope.Others have warned that if the military authorities were to revert to the old playbook of extra-parliamentary intervention, that could risk provoking an angry public backlash."
40,Pita Limjaroenrat: Who is the leader of Thailand's Move Forward party?,"""Today is a new day, and hopefully it is full of bright sunshine and hope,"" 42-year-old Pita Limjaroenrat told a room packed with reporters and flashing cameras, hours after it had become clear that he could well be Thailand's next prime minister. Mr Pita's party, Move Forward, which in Thai evokes leaps of change, has swept to a surprising and stunning victory. Voters rejected nearly a decade of army-backed rule, handing more seats and votes to Move Forward than any other party. That is is no mean achievement in a country that has experienced at least a dozen successful coups. ""The sentiment of the era has changed. And it was the right timing,"" Mr Pita said, speaking at the party's headquarters in Bangkok, where it had won 32 of the city's 33 seats. The business of forming a government is still weeks away. It can also get messy, given that Thailand's military still has the power to play kingmaker. But the win has put the spotlight on Mr Pita and his party, who have built a strong following among young voters disillusioned by years of military rule and hungry for change.Mr Pita started his political career when he was elected to parliament in 2019 as a member of the Future Forward Party. Founded by Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, a billionaire and staunch critic of the army, the party performed well in the 2019 election, shaking up Thai politics with its demand for change.  But Future Forward was forced to disband the following year after contentious allegations. And Mr Thanathorn was disqualified as an MP. Move Forward was formed soon after as its successor and named Mr Pita its new leader.Thousands of young people took to the streets in Thailand that year after the ban, demanding amendments to the constitution, a new election and an end to the harassment of rights activists and state critics.That desire for change and many of those very issues drove Move Forward's appeal in this election, with some of the protest leaders from 2020 running as candidates. Mr Pita - once called a ""rising star"" of the Thai parliament because of the critical speeches he made as an opposition MP - also gained popularity with his party's bold promises to break the military's political influence and reform laws relating to the monarchy.He wants to rewrite the constitution and has pledged to bring Thailand out of what he calls a ""lost decade"" under a military regime.In a campaign interview with Bloomberg in April, Mr Pita said his priorities for Thailand were to ""demilitarise, demonopolise and decentralise"".Move Forward will also continue to push for an end to Thailand's lèse-majesté laws.""We will pass that in this parliament. And we will use the parliament to make sure that it is a comprehensive discussion with maturity, with transparency, in how we should move forward in the relationship between the monarchy and the masses,"" he said on Monday.Mr Pita was born to a wealthy Thai family involved in politics. His father was an adviser in the agriculture ministry and his uncle was an aide of former ousted PM Thaksin Shinawatra.He was sent to school in New Zealand, which is when he developed an interest in politics. ""I got shipped to the middle of nowhere in New Zealand and there were three [TV] channels back then. Either you watch Australian soap operas, or you watch the debates in parliament,"" he told the Thai YouTube programme Aim Hour earlier this year in February.Mr Pita graduated with a bachelor's degree in finance in Bangkok's Thammasat University, a master's in public policy from Harvard University and an MBA from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.He has described himself as ""an American product of public policy schools"".He started his career in business, first taking over the running of his late father's rice bran oil company and later as an executive director of ride-hailing company Grab Thailand.He was married to Chutima Teenpanart, a Thai actress-model, but the couple divorced in 2019. He is now a single dad of seven-year-old Pipim, whom he has brought to Move Forward's rallies.Despite Move Forward's success at the polls on Sunday, it is not a given that he will become prime minister - this will be decided by the military-appointed Senate and the Lower House.Asked on Monday about the uncertainty that the ruling establishment might rig the polls, Mr Pita said: ""I'm not worried, but I'm not careless.""With the consensus that came out of the election, it will be quite a hefty price to pay for someone who is thinking of abolishing the election results... The people of Thailand will not allow that to happen."""
41,Thailand elections: Move Forward looks to make history,"There could only be one place for Thailand's youngest and most progressive party to celebrate its astonishing success in the election. Move Forward and its supporters held their victory rally next to the art deco edifice known as Democracy Monument. Situated right in the middle of the grandest boulevard running through Bangkok's historic royal quarter, it has long been a symbol of the country's frustrated democratic hopes, and the difficult relationship between those hopes and the exalted status of the monarchy. That relationship, once an unmentionable topic, is now on the agenda of the winning party. As is amending the lese majeste or 112 law, forbidding the insult of the monarchy, under which dozens of young protesters who often rallied at this same spot have been charged and jailed.Lorries clad in the party's trademark orange circled the monument, its leaders waving at cheering supporters, many wearing orange ribbons in their hair and on their wrists.""We are so excited and happy,"" said Wiwan Sirivasaree, 35, and Narunphas Kornasavakun, 36, two women who stayed up all night to watch the results come in. ""We have waited four years for this, after what happened last time.""They were referring to Move Forward's previous incarnation Future Forward, which also performed well at the last election in 2019 on the back of a passionate young following, only to be dissolved by Thailand's Constitutional Court and have many of its MPs banned from politics.But Move Forward has come back even stronger, and attracted the support of a much wider range of people.""I think it is fair to say that the sentiment of the era has changed,"" said the Move Forward leader, Pita Limjaroenrat, at his first post-election press conference.Who is Pita Limjaroenrat?The young radicals shaking up the Thai electionAlthough the party's performance - giving it an estimated 151 seats - leaves it well short of a majority in parliament, it was so much stronger than predicted, and better than any other party, that it is being widely seen as a popular mandate for its reform agenda.It has now agreed with Pheu Thai, the second-largest party, which was also in opposition, to form a coalition government. With four smaller opposition parties, Mr Pita said, they do have a clear majority, and a mandate to govern.""The people of Thailand have already spoken their wish, and I am ready to be the prime minister for all, whether you agree with me or disagree with me,"" he added.However, this proposed coalition would not have sufficient seats to outvote its opponents and the unelected 250-seat senate - that, under the military-drafted constitution, is allowed to join the vote for the next prime minister. As the senators were appointed by incumbent Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, it is presumed that they will oppose a Move Forward-led administration. If that happens, there could be a long political stalemate in Thailand.Move Forward seems prepared to take that risk, as if daring the much-criticised senate to block them.""With the consensus which came out of the election there would be quite a hefty price to pay for someone who is thinking of abolishing the election result, or forming a minority government, and I think the people of Thailand would not allow that to happen,"" Mr Pita said.Aside from the senators, the other unknown is whether the Election Commission or the Constitutional Court, two institutions notorious for their role in disabling previous elected governments, find some pretext for dissolving Move Forward.""In other countries when you have the largest two parties like this, combined, with control of more than half the lower chamber, you should be able to form a government,"" says Thitinan Pongsudhirak, from Chulalongkorn University. ""But in Thailand it is up to the referee agencies. And they have shown themselves not to be impartial.""As things stand, Move Forward says it is preparing for government, an unfamiliar experience for its new MPs, some of whom are young political activists with multiple criminal charges hanging over them for their street protests.If it is allowed to take office, the people of Thailand will have the youngest and most progressive government in their country's history."
42,Thailand elections: Voters deliver stunning blow to army-backed rule,"Thai voters have delivered a stunning verdict in favour of an opposition party that is calling for radical reform of the country's institutions. Early results show Move Forward exceeding every prediction to win 151 of the 500 seats in the lower house. It's now 10 seats ahead of what was the frontrunner, Pheu Thai, led by ex-prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra's daughter. Analysts are calling this a political earthquake that represents a significant shift in public opinion.It is also a clear repudiation of the two military-aligned parties of the current government, and Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who led a coup that ousted an elected government in 2014. The governing coalition won only 15% of the seats.  ""We didn't leave any stones unturned,"" Move Forward's 42-year-old leader Pita Limjaroenrat told the BBC. ""People have had enough in the last decade. Now, it's a new day.""  Pheu Thai, the second-largest party, has said it has agreed to join Move Forward and four smaller opposition parties, giving them a coalition of more than 60% of seats in the new parliament. Who is Pita Limjaroenrat?The young radicals shaking up the Thai electionHowever, that still isn't enough to outvote the 250-strong unelected senate, which was appointed by Mr Prayuth, and are allowed to join the vote in parliament for the next administration. They are likely to object to Move Forward's progressive agenda, in particular its pledge to amend the controversial lese majeste law. In the political negotiations which lie ahead, many Thais fear the military and its backers may yet try to block the winning parties from taking office. A military coup is unlikely, but yet another court ruling to disqualify Move Forward on a technicality, as happened to its predecessor Future Forward in 2020, is possible.The other question is how well Move Forward and Pheu Thai, whose relations in the last parliament were sometimes fractious, can work together. Mr Pita, a Harvard University graduate and a skilled parliamentarian, is still untested in the more ruthless art of stitching together and sustaining a coalition.But that uncertainty doesn't change the fact that the people of Thailand woke up to a changed political landscape this morning. ""The majority of votes reflect the need to escape from the 'Prayuth regime', and the yearning for change,"" says Prajak Kongkirati, a political scientist from Thammasat University. ""It shows that people believe in the Move Forward demand for change - many more people than predicted.""Thai social media has been awash with victory messages from Move Forward supporters, who call themselves ""organic canvassers"", and describe the party's win as a ""wind of change"" and the ""dawn of a new era.""Mr Pita tweeted that he was ""ready"" to become the country's 30th prime minister. ""We have the same dreams and hopes. And together we believe that our beloved Thailand can be better, and changes are possible if we start working on them today,"" he wrote. ""This election really tells you that only four years have passed, but the people's thinking has changed a lot, both the establishment and the pro-democracy camps,"" a tweet read, adding that, ""democracy cannot be taken for granted"".  It would have once been unthinkable that Move Forward, a party calling for wholesale changes to Thailand's bureaucracy, its economy, the role of the military, and even the laws protecting the monarchy, could win more seats and votes than any of its rivals. It's no coincidence that these were the same issues that spurred a months-long student-led protest movement in 2020. Some of Move Forward's candidates had been leaders in the movement. And, like the 2020 protests, young and passionate voters, many of them followers of Move Forward, played a big role in the election result. The mood in favour of the young party was hard to miss in the weeks leading up to the election. A new wave of memes exploded on Thai social media - people taking big steps or leaps in an obvious nod to Move Forward's Thai name. And that played out in real life at voting booths on Sunday as people took exaggerated, giant steps to show their support. It was the only way to indicate which way they were leaning because election rules don't allow voters to declare their preferences openly. Others wore bright orange shirts, flip flops and sneakers - the party's chosen colour for campaigning.  Move Forward's candidates had fewer resources than their rivals, and had to rely on social media, and sometimes old technology like bicycles, to get their message across. It helped that their vision seemed much clearer than other parties. Move Forward ruled out any coalition with parties associated with the 2014 military coup, a position on which its reformist rival Pheu Thai was initially evasive. The party was also fresh and bold, and in the last parliament, was known for taking principled positions. It also benefitted from what appears to be a widespread public appetite for change. Voters under 26 years are not a large bloc in ageing Thailand - they make up just 14% of the 52-million electorate - but they worked hard to persuade older voters to back Move Forward to offer their generation a better future.The most immediate question is whether, despite the mandate for change, the two reformist parties are allowed to form a government. Mr Pita was optimistic while addressing the media on Monday. ""With the consensus that came out of the election, it will be quite a hefty price to pay for someone who is thinking of abolishing the election results or forming a minority government... it is quite far-fetched for now,"" he said. ""And I think the people of Thailand will not allow that to happen."" Additional reporting by Thanyarat Doksone"
43,Thailand election: The party they can't stop winning,"For the past few weeks an irresistibly catchy tune has been playing in neighbourhoods across Thailand, from campaign trucks sent out by the Pheu Thai party, the frontrunner in this Sunday's general election. ""A landslide for Pheu Thai, in all areas, so the lives of the people can be better,"" it goes, urging voters to give it a thumping victory.That Pheu Thai (For Thais) is so far ahead of all its rivals is remarkable. This is despite all the efforts made over the past 17 years to weaken it, and to eliminate the influence of Thaksin Shinawatra, the telecoms billionaire who founded its first incarnation, Thai Rak Thai, in 1998. Mr Thaksin's government was deposed by a military coup in 2006, and Thai Rak Thai was dissolved. He has been living in exile since being prosecuted in what his family says are politically-motivated charges. A successor party was also dissolved by the courts in 2008, and in that year two of its prime ministers were disqualified. After Mr Thaksin's sister Yingluck won a landslide in the 2011 election, she too was disqualified by the courts, and her government ousted by a second coup. She is also living in exile. At the last election in 2019 Pheu Thai won far more seats than any other party, but was prevented from forming a government.Now the polls show Pheu Thai on track once again for victory. The Shinawatra family has put forward Thaksin's youngest daughter Paetongtarn to lead the campaign, which she has done even in the last stages of pregnancy, eliciting admiration and sympathy. It has once again run a slick, well-marketed campaign, making a range of appealing offers to the electorate, from a substantial increase in the minimum wage, to a promise of a 10,000 baht ($300; £240) digital wallet for every adult to be spent locally.""I think after eight years the people want better politics, better solutions for the country than just coup d'etats,"" Paetongtarn told the BBC. ""They are seeking policies that will help their lives.""""For many years no other political force has been able to offer an alternative to Pheu Thai, in terms of policy offerings, in terms of charisma, in being able to communicate directly with the people"", says Siripan Nogsuan Sawasdee, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University, who has been making a study of the party's appeal.""And because the last coup d'etat resulted in two military-backed governments which failed miserably in economic performance and in dealing with the Covid pandemic, the popularity of its main opponent Pheu Thai remains high.""Ms Siripan identifies what she calls the three Ps as the key to political success in Thailand; policies, personalities and patronage networks, and political values. Pheu Thai has always been very strong on the first. Thai Rak Thai was a pioneer in this region in running a modern, manifesto-based campaign in its first election campaign in 2001. It offered policies like universal healthcare and village-based micro-credit schemes which directly benefitted rural and low-income communities. It won the Shinawatra family what has proved to be unbreakable loyalty from some of Thailand's largest vote banks.On the second, Pheu Thai has built up an extensive network of local power-brokers, who are very influential in maintaining its popularity and getting the vote out. By contrast the two main conservative parties, formed by the last coup-leader Prayuth Chan-ocha and his allies, are relatively new, and do not have such strong local networks. On the third, Pheu Thai has always successfully portrayed itself both as the party which looks after little people, and which champions democracy, of governments through elections. And that is its main pitch today. If you want an end to conservative, military-backed rule, it says, we are your best choice.But this time it is being outflanked on political values by a more radical and youthful party, Move Forward, which is calling for profound changes to Thailand's power structures. The young radicals shaking up the Thai electionIt wants to stop the military from intervening in politics, to limit its budget, end conscription, and even talks about making the monarchy more accountable. It has pledged never to form a coalition with one of the military-aligned parties, showing up Pheu Thai's evasiveness on this issue. Some observers believe Move Forward's growing popularity could eat into Pheu Thai's votes, although the younger party's support is spread across the country, rather than in certain areas, disadvantaging it in a system where 80% of the seats are elected on a first-past-the-post basis.Pheu Thai is losing its policy edge too, as nearly every main party is now making a crowd-pleasing financial offering to the voters, neutralising the populist appeal that has been the key to Pheu Thai's long run of election wins.""Especially for the younger generation, Thaksin's legacy of policy delivery in the past does not resonate,"" says Siripan from Chulalaongkorn. ""And don't forget there will be four million first-time voters in this election. Pheu Thai's image as the default anti-military party is facing a real challenge from Move Forward. ""But I still believe Pheu Thai will win by a large margin. It still has the second P, the patronage networks through its candidates in the north and north-east, where Move Forward, as the newer party, has not established these kinds of connections.""If the predictions of the opinion polls hold, and both Pheu Thai and Move Forward perform well enough to ensure they have a substantial majority of the 500 seats in the lower house, the big question is whether they will be allowed to form a government. The military-drafted constitution allows 250 senators, all appointed by the junta that seized power in 2014, to join the vote on the choice of the next prime minister. The pliant courts could once again be deployed to dissolve one or both of the reformist parties. Thailand will then be confronted with a choice. Should it stick to the old, authoritarian playbook, which sees election results as optional, rather than essential factors in who holds power? Or should it break out of the cycle of coups, party dissolutions and street violence which have plagued the country for two decades?The student daring to challenge Thailand’s monarchyWhy Thai protesters are willing to break the law Inside Thailand's 'weed wonderland' Thai boy's death shatters happiest of endingsUncertain fate awaits Thailand's elephant tourism"
44,Thailand election: The young radicals shaking up politics,"In a cramped shophouse in one of Bangkok's nondescript outer suburbs, a small group of volunteers feverishly pack leaflets in preparation for the daily ritual of canvassing for votes. This is the decidedly low-rent campaign headquarters in Bang Bon for Move Forward, the most radical party contesting this month's general election in Thailand.Pacing among them is the parliamentary candidate, Rukchanok ""Ice"" Srinork, a 28-year-old woman brimming with energy. Ice's team have bought cheap bicycles, and for weeks now they have been using them, in brutally hot weather, to reach out to residents in the smallest alleys of Bang Bon. Ice is one of a slate of young, idealistic candidates for Move Forward who have joined mainstream politics in the hope that this election allows Thailand to break the cycle of military coups, street protests and broken democratic promises in which the country has been trapped for two decades. Move Forward is the successor party to Future Forward, which exploded onto the political stage in Thailand five years ago. It contested the first election permitted since a coup in 2014 deposed the then-elected government. Future Forward was something new, promising sweeping changes to Thailand's political structures, including limiting the power of the armed forces, and, more quietly, suggesting changes to the monarchy, then a strictly taboo topic.""Their agenda was basically about taking Thailand's future back from the powers-that-be,"" says Thitinan Pongsudhirak, from the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University. ""In this century young people have had to live in a country that has been lost to an endless cycle - we had two coups, two new constitutions, a series of judicial dissolutions of parties. I think the younger demographic got sick and tired of it. And Future Forward tapped into that sentiment.""It stunned conservatives by winning the third largest share of seats in the 2019 election. Thailand's royalist establishment, a network of military officers, senior bureaucrats and judges, responded as it has to similar threats in the past - it had Future Forward dissolved by the Constitutional Court, and banned its leaders from politics. The party lost about one-third of its MPs, and its replacement, Move Forward, became a lonely opposition voice in parliament.Yet in recent weeks the party's popularity in opinion polls has been surging again, alarming rivals. Many polls put its leader, the telegenic and articulate Pita Limjaroenrat, as the preferred candidate for prime minister. That popularity is changing the reception Ice and her bicycling volunteers are getting in Bang Bon, traditionally the fiefdom of a powerful family from a rival party. People are genuinely interested in what these youngsters have to offer. Even older residents talk about the need for big changes in Thailand.Ice herself epitomises this shifting political landscape. She admits she used to be a die-hard royalist, who cheered on the military coup and admired the man who led it, General Prayuth Chan-ocha, who is still prime minister today.""I think that I'm doing this partly out of feeling guilty that I was part of a movement that encouraged the coup, a crime against 70 million people,"" she says. ""At that time, I agreed with it and thought it was the right answer for the country. But later I asked myself, how could that happen? How could this nation support a freaking coup? And that's when I became taa sawang.""""Taa Sawang"" - literally, ""bright eyes"" - is the phrase adopted by younger Thais to describe their being enlightened about previously taboo topics, in particular the monarchy. It was a watchword of the mass protest movement that erupted after Future Forward was banned in 2020, at a stroke disenfranchising millions of younger voters who were hungry for change. And that movement, while it was eventually crushed through the extensive use of the draconian lese majeste law, shattered the taboo, by calling openly, for the first time, for the powers and financing of the monarchy to be accountable. Three years later, Move Forward's support for royal reform no longer seems so shocking. And more Thais seem willing to back the party's broader agenda for change.Chonticha ""Kate"" Jangrew's journey has been from the opposite direction. Her ""taa sawang"" moment was much earlier, when she was still a student. She was among a very small group of dissidents willing to risk arrest by protesting against the 2014 coup that Ice was still cheering. She also joined the much bigger, monarchy-focused protests of 2020. But now she has decided to give up her activist life, and run as a candidate for parliament, also for Move Forward. ""I believe to achieve the changes we want we have to work in parliament as well as on the streets,"" she says.Her pitch to voters in Pathum Thani, another district outside Bangkok, is unusual. ""I have 28 criminal charges against me,"" she tells them - two are under the lese majeste law, which carries a penalty of 15 years in prison for each. ""But that shows you I am brave enough to speak out when I see something that needs to happen for our country."" Even older voters seem charmed by her youthful sincerity. Almost everyone at the market where she appeared said they liked Move Forward, because they represented change, and would stick to their promises.For all the buzz generated by Move Forward, few believe they can win enough seats to form a government. The revised electoral system is less favourable to them than last time. And Thailand is an aging society, so voters under 26 years old - Move Forward's natural supporters - make up less than 15% of the electorate. But if the party's current surge in support holds until polling day, they could do well enough to be part of a coalition government, or a strong opposition voice. Then the inevitable question arises - will the establishment reach into its arsenal of extra-parliamentary schemes to disable the reformists once again?""The Move Forward party's agenda is an existential challenge to the established centres of power - the military, monarchy, judiciary, the institutions and players that have run Thailand for decades,"" says Thitinan Pongsudhirak. ""Right now, they will probably wait for the poll results. But after that, the conservative establishment will have to ask themselves, what else they can do? They dissolve parties, but they come back, even stronger. They have military coups, but eventually they have to go back to a constitution. And even though they rewrite the electoral rules in their favour, their parties still lose the election.""The student daring to challenge Thailand’s monarchyWhy Thai protesters are willing to break the law Inside Thailand's 'weed wonderland' Thai boy's death shatters happiest of endingsUncertain fate awaits Thailand's elephant tourism"
45,Thai serial killer case: Ex-husband arrested in poisoning deaths,"The ex-husband of a Thai woman charged with murdering 14 people with cyanide has surrendered after police issued an arrest warrant.Vitoon Rangsiwuthaporn was a senior policeman in Ratchaburi province, where one of the alleged killings took place.His ex-wife, Sararat Rangsiwuthaporn, was arrested in Bangkok last week in a suspected serial killer case that has gripped the country.Police have charged her with 14 counts of murder- which she denies.The first suspected murders began in 2020, but police believe there are more victims and have urged people to come forward.Thai authorities said Ms Sararat was motivated by money. She secured loans worth thousands of dollars, and also stole her victims' jewellery and other belongings, police said.On Wednesday, Ms Sararat's former husband Mr Rangsiwuthaporn was charged with fraud and embezzlement related to the killings.Police said he turned himself into a police station after authorities issued an arrest warrant. The couple, while divorced, had still been living together.Police say Mr Rangsiwuthaporn was most likely involved in Ms Sararat's alleged murder of an ex-boyfriend, Suthisak Poonkwan.Police said that after she killed him, Mr Rangsiwuthaporn picked her up in her car and drove her around the local Udon Thani province, where she extorted money from Suthisak's friends.Police said the killings had taken place in several provinces since 2020, mostly west of Bangkok. They believed Ms Sararat murdered her targets by slipping cyanide pills into their food and drink, or offering the pills as herbal medicine.Cyanide starves the body's cells of oxygen, which can then induce heart attacks. Early symptoms of poisoning include dizziness, shortness of breath, and vomiting.Police said she would befriend wealthy people and earn their trust, before inviting them to a meal or on a trip. The known victims were aged 33-45.""She asked people she knows for money because she has a lot of credit card debt... and if they asked her for their money back she started killing them,"" said deputy national police chief Surachate Hakparn at a press conference on Wednesday.One friend, who police believe was targeted, had loaned her 250,000 baht (£5,900; $7,300) police said. The woman had vomited and fainted after having lunch with Sararat but survived.Ms Sararat was arrested on 25 April, two weeks after a wealthy friend died while on a trip with her.Siriporn Khanwong had collapsed on a riverbank in Ratchaburi province, after travelling there with Ms Sararat to take part in a Buddhist protection ritual.Her phone, money and jewellery were missing when she was found and an autopsy found traces of cynanide in her body.Her mother had raised suspicions with police, after noting that Ms Sararat had only recently befriended her daughter.Police found a bottle of cyanide in Ms Sararat's home when she was arrested last week. Local media reported she is four months pregnant and has two children with Mr Rangsiwuthaporn, who has taken leave from the police force.The pair lived in police flats in Kanchanaburi, a riverside holiday destination west of the country, local media reported. They reported her neighbours saying that she kept mostly to herself and would interact only with families of rich policemen.Police are also investigating Ms Sararat's sister, who owns a pharmacy.Police say they are still gathering evidence on more related cases. A trial date has not yet been set."
46,Thailand: Southeast Asia's 'weed wonderland',"A new symbol has appeared in the kaleidoscopic jumble of neon signs that light up Sukhumvit Road, Bangkok's most international street. The sudden ubiquity of the five-pointed marijuana leaf, in lurid green, announces the spectacular boom there has been in weed-related businesses in Thailand since cannabis was decriminalised last June. Walk two kilometres east of the BBC office in Bangkok, and you pass more than 40 dispensaries, selling potent marijuana flower buds and all the paraphernalia needed to smoke them.Travel in the opposite direction, to the famous backpacker hangout of Khao San Road, and there is an entire marijuana-themed shopping mall, Plantopia, its shops half-hidden behind the haze of smoke created by customers trying out the product. The website Weed in Thailand lists more than 4,000 businesses across the country selling cannabis and its derivatives.And this is Thailand, where until last June you could be jailed for five years just for possessing marijuana, up to 15 years for producing it; where other drug offences get the death penalty. The pace of change has been breathtaking.""It is messy, but then this is Thailand, and without this sudden liberalisation I don't think it would have happened at all,"" says Kitty Chopaka, founder of Chopaka, a company that offers advice on the marijuana industry, and has been a part of the parliamentary committee trying to get the new regulations passed.But this is not the kind of liberalisation long-term campaigners like her dreamed of. ""We need regulation. Spelling out what you can and cannot do,"" Ms Chopaka says. ""It is causing a lot of confusion, a lot of people not knowing what they can do, what they can put money behind.""There are some rules in this apparent free-for-all, but they are being enforced haphazardly, if at all. Not all dispensaries have a licence, which they are required to have, and they are supposed to record the provenance of all their cannabis flowers and the personal details of every customer. No products aside from the unprocessed flower are supposed to have more than 0.2 percent THC, the psychotropic chemical in cannabis, nor can they be sold online. Yet you can find suppliers offering potent weed brownies and gummies with high THC content online, with delivery to your door within an hour. Cannabis cannot be sold to anyone under 20 years old, but who is to know if the product is simply delivered by a motorbike courier? There are restaurants serving marijuana-laced dishes, you can get marijuana tea, and marijuana ice-cream. Convenience stores are even selling weed-tinged drinking water. The police have admitted that they are so unsure of what is and is not legal they are enforcing very few rules around marijuana.The new cannabis regime is a bit of a political accident. Anutin Charnvirakul, head of one of Thailand's larger political parties, made decriminalisation part of his manifesto for the 2019 election. It proved a vote-winner, mostly on the as-yet untested notion that cannabis could be a profitable alternative cash crop for poor farmers. As health minister in the new government, Mr Anutin prioritised getting it taken off the banned narcotics list as soon as possible to fulfil his election pledge.But Thailand's parliament, a cauldron of competing interest groups, moves slowly. Cannabis was decriminalised before anyone had been able to write regulations to control the new business. And the planned new laws got bogged down by inter-party bickering. With another general election taking place in May, there is little chance of the law getting through the parliament before the end of the year. Already rival parties are warning of the dangers of unregulated weed, and threatening to re-criminalise it if they take power.The future of this free-wheeling new industry is uncertain. Tukta, a 21-year-old university student,  jumped on the marijuana bandwagon last year, sinking more than one million baht ($30,000; £23,500) into a dispensary and coffee shop called The Herb Club in Bangkok's Klong Toei district. She sells 16 different grades of the cured flower, ranging from $10 to $80 a gram, but she worries about possible changes in the law. With so much competition from the many other dispensaries nearby, she says business is neither bad nor good. ""The price is falling because there's a glut of marijuana,"" Ms Chopaka says. ""There are a lot of illegal imports. We are growing strains from overseas, which need air-conditioning and lighting. We should look into developing strains that work for our climate to lower costs.""We really need to go back to our old heritage, our old cultures. Because cannabis and Thais, Thailand, are very interwoven with each other.""For many Thais, who have grown up in a country which viewed all narcotics as a dangerous social evil, the dramatic flowering of the weed business since last year is bewildering. Yet the unforgiving official view of drugs is a relatively recent development.Up until the late 1970s marijuana was widely cultivated by the hill tribes in northern Thailand, in the border area known as the Golden Triangle, which also used to be the source of much of the world's opium. Marijuana had also been used extensively as a herb and cooking ingredient in north-eastern Thailand. When US soldiers arrived in the 1960s on ""rest and recreation"" breaks from fighting in the Vietnam War they discovered Thai stick, locally made from cured marijuana buds wrapped in leaves around a bamboo stick, like a fat cigar. The soldiers began shipping Thai marijuana back home in large quantities; along with Golden Triangle heroin it made up much of the narcotics flow going into the United States. As the Vietnam War wound down, the US put pressure on Thailand to curb drug production. In 1979 Thailand passed a sweeping Narcotics Act, mandating harsh penalties for using and selling drugs, including the death sentence. This coincided with a conservative backlash across South East Asia against permissive 1960s attitudes to drugs and sex, a reaction to the ganja-smoking backpackers travelling east along the ""hippie trail"". Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia all instructed their immigration officers to look out for hippies and bar them entry. At Singapore airport those with long hair were given a choice of a trip to the barber or being turned around. In Malaysia anyone with sufficiently suspect attributes would have the letters SHIT - suspected hippie in transit - stamped in their passports before being deported. The Thai government was especially wary of alternative youth culture after it crushed a leftist student movement, killing dozens at Bangkok's Thammasat University in October 1976. Conservatives feared they might support a communist takeover in Thailand, as had just happened in neighbouring Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. Meanwhile a series of royally-sponsored crop substitution projects persuaded most hill tribes to stop cultivating opium and marijuana, and try coffee or macadamia nuts instead. Since the 1990s cheap methamphetamines have poured into Thailand from war-torn areas of Myanmar. The ruinous social impact of meth addiction turned the Thai public even more firmly against drugs, and led to a brutal anti-drug campaign in 2003, in which at least 1,400 suspected users and dealers were gunned down.It was the dire overcrowding in Thailand's prisons - three-quarters of them in for drug offences, many quite minor - that finally persuaded Thai officials to rethink their hardline approach, along with the realisation that marijuana's medicinal and therapeutic applications might be a valuable complement to the country's successful medical tourism industry. It was not much of a leap from that to see the potential in recreational marijuana too.""Welcome to Amsterdam on steroids,"" booms Tom Kruesopon, the Thai entrepreneur known here as ""Mr Weed"" for his role in getting the drug laws liberalised, to a group of German tourists just off the plane, who cannot quite believe what they are seeing. Mr Kruesopon has opened a branch of the US cannabis store Cookies in Bangkok, and runs through the different strains of locally-grown marijuana, each in its own illuminated jar. Weed-themed underwear, slippers and t-shirts are on the shelves. Perhaps it's the familiar tales of hapless Westerners locked up for decades in the Bangkok Hilton that make the visitors seem a bit hesitant. But Mr Kruesopon assures them they can no longer be arrested for buying and consuming any part of the marijuana plant in Thailand, though he does not allow smoking in his shop. He believes the business will continue to grow. ""You're going to have a few billion-dollar companies here - I guarantee it."" But he also accepts that better regulation is essential ""otherwise you're going to kill the golden goose"".Outside of parliament public debate about cannabis is surprisingly muted. ""It's not ok. It's still like narcotics to me… Only the youngsters are using it more and those who have used it before are using it again,"" says a 32-year-old street vendor. But an older motorcycle taxi driver says legalising marijuana has neither helped nor harmed him: ""We're not paying attention because we haven't been smoking pot. It doesn't matter to us anyway.""Some doctors have warned of the dangers of cannabis addiction, but for most Thais it pales beside the long-standing methamphetamine crisis. Dispensaries in central Bangkok say most of their customers are foreign tourists, not Thais. The most enthusiastic supporters of the new regime are the not insignificant numbers of people in Thailand who were already using marijuana regularly.Self-styled ""stoner"" Amanda is one of them. She is happy to be able to cultivate the kinds of strains she likes at home, without fearing a knock on the door from the police. She has turned her small apartment into something like a shrine to the wonder-weed, filling her little bedroom balcony with reflective tents and powerful lights where she carefully tends seven plants. Her cat is no longer allowed in the bedroom.""It was difficult at first. I had a lot to learn. I didn't get the temperature right at first, and using air-conditioning 24 hours a day, I need a humidifier. But it is so awesome this happened in Thailand. There are thousands of farms and dispensaries now, so many interesting people in the business.""For all the talk in Thai political parties of re-criminalising marijuana, or trying to restrict it to medical, rather than recreational use - a distinction those in the business say is almost impossible to make - it seems unlikely that after the last, crazy nine months the cork can be put back in the bottle. But where Thailand's free-wheeling marijuana industry goes from here is anybody's guess.Thailand's trip from war on drugs to weed curriesWhy Vietnam doesn't want to claim Ke Huy Quan'We wish we could go back': Life in a war-torn MyanmarShe treated the resistance, and paid with her lifeThe US wants to play in China's backyard"
47,Thai woman accused of murdering 12 friends in cyanide poisonings,"Thai police say they have arrested a woman suspected of killing 12 of her friends and acquaintances by poisoning them with cyanide.Sararat Rangsiwuthaporn was arrested in Bangkok on Tuesday following recent inquiries into a friend's death.The victim's family had raised suspicions after she died on a trip with Sararat earlier this month.Following inquiries, police this week said they believed Sararat had killed 11 others, including an ex-boyfriend.Police allege she killed for financial reasons. Sararat has denied all the charges. Thai authorities have denied her bail.Two weeks ago, she had travelled with her friend to Ratchaburi province, west of Bangkok, where they had taken part in a Buddhist protection ritual at a river, police said. Shortly after, her friend Siriporn Khanwong collapsed and died on the riverbank.Traces of cyanide were found in her body during the autopsy, police said. Her phone, money and bags were also missing when she was found.Authorities said the other alleged victims had died in a similar way, but did not disclose further information. The murders began in 2020, they said.They also didn't identify all of the victims, but named Sararat's former partner, as well as two female police officers, among the dead.Thai police have also questioned Sararat's partner- a senior police officer in Ratchaburi province, where her friend died. The pair have recently split, Thai media reported.Police said Sararat knew all of the victims and she may have been motivated by financial reasons.One friend, who police believe was targeted, had loaned her 250,000 baht (£5,900; $7,300) police said. The woman had vomited and fainted after having lunch with Sararat but survived.Relatives of victims had also reported missing jewellery and cash, police said.But the families had not suspected foul play at the time, officers said, indicating that evidence gathering could be a challenge. Some bodies had also been cremated, police said.Cyanide can be detected in corpses several months after death, if a lethal amount was used.The poison starves the body's cells of oxygen, which can induce heart attacks. Early symptoms include dizziness, shortness of breath, and vomiting.Its use in Thailand is heavily regulated and those found to have unauthorised access face up two years in jail."
48,Myanmar coup: Thousands of Burmese flee to Thailand after intense fighting,"Some 10,000 Burmese people have fled to Thailand to escape fierce fighting between the military and units of a powerful ethnic armed group since Wednesday, Thai authorities said.They are fleeing from Shwe Kokko town, controlled by a pro-military militia and home to Chinese-owned casinos. This is one of the largest cross-border movements of people since a military coup two years ago. The military has not released a statement yet about the fighting.  It is the latest in a civil war that has been raging since the coup in February 2021. Two years on, the military government has failed to impose its authority on large areas of the country. It is battling established ethnic armed groups in border areas that have been at war with the military for decades, and recently-formed anti-coup militias that call themselves People's Defence Forces (PDFs) in much of the rest of the country.Many thousands of people have been killed and some 1.4 million have been displaced since the coup. Nearly one third of the country's population is in need of aid, according to the United Nations.The latest fighting broke out after the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) and its allies launched attacks on military outposts and a gate camp near Shwe Kokko on Wednesday. More than 80 people have been killed on both sides, KNLA told BBC Thai. Aid workers in the border regions - Thailand's Mae Sot and Mae Ramat areas - have called for urgent humanitarian assistance as refugees seek shelter in schools, monasteries and rubber farms. ""In the long run, we need more donors,"" said Kay Thi Htwe, a Burmese volunteer at a monastery in Mae Sot, which is hosting 500 refugees. The KNLA has also closed the Myawaddy-Kawkareik Asia highway - one of the main roads to the border - for two weeks starting Friday. Back in Shwe Kokko, the military-aligned Border Guard Forces which controls the enclave is protecting the casinos and warning residents to stay indoors. This comes as the military continues to crush civilian resistance, targeting schools, clinics and villages. Earlier this week, the military said it had arrested 15 teachers who had been giving online classes for a school backed by the exiled National Unity Government (NUG).The teachers were taken from their homes in Mandalay, Saigang and Magway, a member of the General Strike Committee of Basic Education Workers told the BBC. In July, about 30 teachers were reportedly arrested because they worked for an NUG-recognised online school. From the start, education has been a battleground in Myanmar. Teachers were among the first, along with health-workers, to walk out in protest against the coup, and were in the front line of the huge protests called by the Civil Disobedience Movement in the first weeks after the military takeover.When that was crushed, most still refused orders by the military junta that they should return to work, and in May 2020 around 150,000 teachers and university lecturers were dismissed from their jobs. Many decided to go underground, joining schools and clinics in areas where communities had begun an armed struggle against military rule.The military views the establishment of independent schools and clinics as an existential threat. Official figures suggest the number of students taking the 10th grade matriculation exam in state-run schools is now only one fifth of the number doing so before the coup. Teachers working outside the state sector have been branded as terrorists.

49,Thailand air pollution: Thick smog chokes Chiang Rai this week,"Drone footage has captured extreme air pollution in Chiang Rai, Thailand. The city’s parks and streets are near unrecognisable, with buildings reduced to smoky outlines."
50,Thailand's extreme air pollution: 'I feel sorry for my daughter',"For the past few weeks, Thommamoon Khowasat has painstakingly explained to his four year-old daughter that the yellow cloud they see outside their window - which has tickled her imagination - is actually a danger to her health.It's a scare that has gripped northern Thailand where millions of people are currently finding it harder to breathe. Widespread farm burning and forest fires have created a smog that's even thicker than usual, which is choking communities and exposing them to respiratory disease.In the tourist-favoured Chiang Rai province, and even the capital Bangkok, people have been on edge checking the air quality levels every day.""I feel very sorry for my daughter,"" said Thommamoon, who has not seen haze this thick in the 20 years he has lived in Chiang Rai. ""As a child she doesn't know. She thinks that it's natural fog. But the truth is a poisonous mist.""The girl is under strict orders to stay at home, but even indoors and with an air purifier whirring away, the air quality is compromised.At Chiang Rai's Mae Chan Hospital, Dr. Veera Isarathanan fears for newborns who are exposed to the air pollution. Babies can't wear face masks, and even with a purifier machine, the air in the nursery can be hazardous.""[It's sad] newborn children have to encounter pollution like this. Their lungs are just starting to work,"" Dr Isarathanan said.Thailand's air pollution is an issue year each year in the dry season - which typically runs from November to March - mainly due to seasonal burning from farmers clearing their sugarcane and rice fields.But the smog has been particularly bad this year. On 10 March, Thai health authorities reported that in the first nine weeks of the year, more than 1.3 million people had already suffered air pollution-related diseases. Nearly 200,000 of these cases were reported in the first week of March - when the haze had started to worsen.In Chiang Rai, the haze has grown so thick to obscure its famous mountains, and what is usually lush, green foliage appears grey.Drone footage passing over the city's parks and streets show them near unrecognisable, with buildings reduced to smoky outlines. The levels of the hazardous PM 2.5 particles have also soared - these are particles are small enough to be be breathed into lungs and even enter bloodstreams.Exposure to PM 2.5 dust can cause burning and itching in the eyes and skin,  as well as coughing and chest tightness. These symptoms can be amplified for those who have pre-existing heart or lung conditions.In Chiang Rai, fire trucks were this week deployed to blast water into the air to clear the dust. But it's only a short-term measure. Authorities have warned that the grim scenario will persist for the coming days, with few winds forecast that could blow the dust away.On Monday, about 200 people in the Chiang Rai district of Mae Sai protested outside a local government office demanding authorities take action.""Nowadays, Mae Sai people live in misery. Both young and old, living in hardship,"" said one of the demonstrators, Somyot Nittayaroj.Somyot said the haze had gotten worse in the last two to three years. The day of the protest, the air quality in parts of Chiang Rai was nearly 125 times over the limit deemed safe by the World Health Organization.Protesters said Thailand should negotiate with Myanmar and other neighbouring countries where agricultural burning has contributed to the smog.Satellite data showed that many of fire hot spots were located in Myanmar, followed by Laos. Fires were also spotted in Cambodia and Vietnam.However a majority of the pollution still comes from closer sources. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has directed lawmakers to go after perpetrators of forest fires and there are laws in place curtailing agricultural burning. But the problem is most of these restrictions are ignored. For farmers, burning their plot is often the easiest and cheapest method to clear land."

53,Thailand parliament dissolved ahead of May election,"Thailand's king has dissolved parliament, paving the way for a general election in early May. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha's new conservative, royalist party faces a strong challenge from the Pheu Thai party, led by exiled former PM Thaksin Shinawatra's daughter Paetongtarn.Mr Prayuth, who led a 2014 coup against the last pro-Thaksin government, has trailed in opinion polls for months.The election date has not been set, but must be within 60 days of dissolution.Mr Prayuth and his United Thai Nation party hope there is still sufficient animosity towards Mr Thaksin among conservative Thais to give him a shot at keeping his job.Thailand's current constitution - written by the military - could make it hard for the opposition to form a new government.Campaigning by dozens of parties is already under way. Bangkok's pavements are disappearing behind a blizzard of party posters making all kinds of promises to the voters. In the end, though, this election is really about one thing: can Pheu Thai win by a sufficiently large margin to ensure it takes power again? Nearly every poll is predicting that it will once again be the largest party, as it has been in every election for the past 22 years, relying on strong loyalty to Mr Thaksin in the north and north-east. Some think Pheu Thai may even win an outright majority of seats in the lower house. But that may not be enough, given the enduring animosity towards Mr Thaksin and his allies from conservative royalists and the military.In the past, judicial rulings or military coups have prevented three Thaksin-backed governments, including one led by his sister Yingluck, from completing their term. Mr Prayuth has been in power since leading the coup against Ms Yingluck's government nine years ago.Mr Thaksin has been in exile since he was deposed by a military coup in 2006, avoiding a list of criminal charges, even as many of his lieutenants are now banned from politics.Yet he is still there, hovering over this election like a ghost, his 36-year-old daughter being the latest Shinawatra family member to front the party.Speaking on Friday at an event to introduce Pheu Thai's candidates, Ms Paetongtarn said she was confident of winning the election by a landslide.After the last coup, the military resolved to finish the Thaksin problem once and for all by rewriting the constitution to ensure his party could not take power. They appointed 250 senators, most of whom are presumed still to be loyal to Generals Prayuth and Prawit Wongsuwan, the men who led the last coup.With the senators' backing, and after a good deal of manoeuvring, Pheu Thai was kept out of office at the last election in 2019. The two generals have led a fractious conservative coalition since then.  However they now each head their own parties, at risk of dividing the conservative vote.Under the military-drafted constitution, the senators can still vote one more time on the choice of the next prime minister. With their support, the two generals could still form a government even if Pheu Thai does win a majority. But the senators cannot vote for laws or budgets, and any administration which depends on their backing cannot function. If Pheu Thai gets more than 200 out of the 500 seats being contested, it will be difficult or even impossible to exclude them from the next government. This being Thailand, no-one can rule out another extra-parliamentary move against the party; not a coup this time, but perhaps another party dissolution by the reliably conservative courts."
54,Thai man jailed for insulting king over duck calendar,"A Thai man has been jailed for two years for selling calendars which featured satirical comments and rubber ducks in royal regalia, which prosecutors said defamed the monarchy.Narathorn Chotmankongsin, 26, has been convicted of insulting the Thai king.He is among about 200 people who have been arrested under lese majeste laws since 2020 in what critics say has been a crackdown on free speech.The rubber duck has been a symbol of pro-democracy protesters in Thailand.Activists widely used the symbol in demonstrations where they called for a democratic transition - a movement which also includes demands for reforms to the monarchy.Narathorn was arrested in December 2020 for selling the calendars on the pro-democracy Facebook page Ratasadon. The political satire featured illustrations of ducks in royal regalia, and controversial captions.Prosecutors argued the images and descriptions ridiculed and defamed King Maha Vajiralongkorn. A court on Tuesday sentenced Narathorn to three years, before commuting the sentence to two years.The many ways to get arrested for insulting the Thai monarchyThailand's lese-majeste law explained Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the sentence showed Thai authorities were punishing any activity they deemed insulted the monarchy.""This case sends a message to all Thais, and to the rest of the world, that Thailand is moving further away from - not closer to - becoming a rights-respecting democracy,"" said HRW Asia director Elaine Pearson.Rights groups have accused the Thai government of exploiting the royal insult law in recent years to clamp down on political dissent.The youthful protests which broke out in Thailand in July 2020, and continued into 2021, shocked conservative royalists. For the first time young activists demanded reforms to the country's powerful monarchy, and during their street rallies openly mocked members of the royal family. Critics also say the scope of what counts as an offence is widened. For example, protesters wearing skimpy crop-tops, similar to those sometimes worn by the king, and a protester wearing a pink dress similar to one worn by Queen Suthida were prosecuted. The criminalisation of cartoons featuring yellow ducks is another leap in the use of the law. The giant inflatable ducks became a feature of the 2020 protests when they were brought in to add an element of fun and ridicule in response to the heavy-handed riot-control tactics used by the police. They were not viewed at the time as satirising the monarchy, although the prosecution alleged at the trial that the way the ducks were dressed in the defendant's calendars did suggest a link with the king.Thailand is frequently criticised both for the very broad interpretations it allows of the lese majeste law, for the secrecy of the trials and the routine denial of bail, as well as the almost 100% conviction rate, and for the severity of the sentences. However Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has rejected this criticism. The government still insists the law is needed to defend the monarchy, the survival of which is officially viewed as essential to Thailand's national identity.Thai authorities have also increasingly used the country's computer crime laws to prosecute those who've posted critical comments on social media.On Wednesday, two young activists currently detained under lese majeste charges entered their 50th day of a hunger strike protesting against the strict law."
55,Nicholas Cash: Police say domestic abuser may be in Thailand,"A man recently convicted of ""abhorrent"" domestic abuse offences might be on the run in Thailand, police have said. Nicholas Cash was last week found guilty at Bournemouth Crown Court of charges including coercive control, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and administering a poisonous or noxious substance with intent.Dorset Police said the 23-year-old had failed to turn up to his trial and officers were now trying to locate him. He is due to be sentenced on 14 March The force said it believed Cash, who lived in Bournemouth, could have travelled to Thailand but this could not be confirmed. Det Con Michael White said Cash had been the perpetrator of ""the most despicable psychological, emotional and physical abuse"" on his victim. He added: ""We have worked hard to compile evidence and secure a conviction against Cash.""Now we are determined to locate him to ensure he faces the consequences of his abhorrent offending.""Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

56,"Thai drug dealer had plastic surgery to look like Korean man, police say","A Thai drug dealer underwent several facial plastic surgeries to look like ""a handsome Korean man"" and evade the law, local authorities have said.Saharat Sawangjaeng, who adopted the alias Seong Jimin, was caught last week at a condominium in Bangkok.Police, who had been on the hunt for the 25-year-old for three months, said ""none of his original face was left"".They tracked him down by tracing the distribution of ecstasy to other sellers and buyers in Bangkok.Witnesses described him as a ""handsome Korean man"" to police. He had also changed his name to a Korean one. In a video of the arrest provided by the police, Mr Saharat said he wanted to move to South Korea: ""I want to start a new life. I am bored of Thailand"". Mr Saharat has been charged with the illegal import of narcotics. He admitted to ordering MDMA -  also known as ecstasy - over the dark web using cryptocurrencies, the police said last week.He had in previous years been arrested on at least three occasions. One time he was detained on an assault charge, and the police found 290 ecstasy pills and 2kg (4.4lb) of narcotics in liquid form in his possession.But he managed to escape detention and at one point, underwent extensive surgical procedures to dodge investigators. Thai Police major-general Theeradej Thammasutee described him as ""one of the main causes of Bangkok's MDMA epidemic"", The Straits Times reported.""He is a drug lord importing MDMA from Europe at just 25 years old. We believe there are more suspects in foreign countries. We will continue our investigation,"" Mr Thammasutee said.While Mr Saharat said in the video that he mostly imported drugs from the Netherlands, he added that he did not know the identity of the people he dealt with as part of the operation.

57,Yorkshire Dales body: Police unable to speak with Thai woman's husband,"Police who travelled to Thailand to speak with the family of a woman found dead in the Yorkshire Dales have been unable to meet with her husband.Walkers discovered the half-naked body of Lamduan Armitage, nee Seekanya, in a stream near Pen-y-ghent in 2004.For 15 years her identity was unknown until family in Thailand came forward and DNA proved it was their daughter.Officers have spoken with her parents but have not yet managed to meet with her husband David Armitage.Before they flew out to Thailand on 15 February, North Yorkshire Police said they could not move the case forward without ""understanding from Lamduan's family all the aspects about her life and particularly the last few months of her life"".While in the country they have worked alongside the Thai police's Department of Special Investigation (DSI) following a request from the force seeking interviews from witnesses in Udon Thani, Bangkok and Kanchanaburi.Udomkann Warotamasikkhadit, head of the DSI's foreign affairs and international relations division, said Mr Armitage had initially agreed to come and give evidence.But he said on the day he refused and added: ""He said he didn't feel well and also had some personal issues.""Adam Harland, manager of the major investigation team's cold case review unit, said it was ""unfortunate"" that they had not been able to ""seek the views of the whole family around Lamduan's remains"".Mr Harland said officers would now return to North Yorkshire while the DSI continued its investigations.A post-mortem examination carried out after Lamduan's body was found on 20 September 2004 failed to establish how she died.There was no sign of violence and hypothermia was ruled out, but detectives could not answer two main questions; who she was or how she met her death.Local people paid for her burial in the churchyard in Horton-in-Ribblesdale and she became known as The Lady of the Hills.A cold case review was started in 2016 and scientific advances meant police were able to piece together a more detailed picture of who she was and came to the conclusion she had been killed.In 2019, there was a major breakthrough when a Thai family read a BBC online story about the case and believed the woman could be their daughter who vanished in 2004.This led North Yorkshire Police to carry out DNA testing with the parents in order to confirm Mrs Armitage's identity.It was established she had moved to the UK in 1991 with Mr Armitage after they were married in Thailand and they had been living in northern England before her death.Mr Armitage, who later returned to Thailand, has previously said he was not involved in his wife's death, according to The Sun.Mr Harland said from meeting Lamduan's mother Joomsri Seekanya, the family's desperate wish was for her daughter's body to be returned to Thailand.However, he said relatives were presented with a memorial book showing the spot where Lamduan was buried and how the community had cared for her.""Mr and Mrs Seekanya were deeply moved by this and they asked for their warm thanks and appreciation to be passed on to residents in Horton-in-Ribblesdale.""Additional reporting by BBC Thai's Chaiyot Yongcharoenchai in Bangkok.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

58,Thai cave rescue: Duangphet Phromthep inquest opens in UK,"An inquest into the death of Duangphet Phromthep, one of 12 boys rescued from a Thai cave in 2018, has been opened and adjourned in the UK.The 17-year-old had been enrolled in the football academy at Brooke House College in Leicestershire, where he was found unconscious on 12 February.He died at Kettering General Hospital on 14 February.A provisional cause of death has been identified but this was not disclosed at the inquest opening.Professor Catherine Mason, senior coroner for Leicester City and South Leicestershire, said: ""A cause of death has been provided. The cause of death is provisional until the formal hearing.""Investigations and inquiries are continuing and I'm not in a position to proceed.""She said a review hearing would take place on 6 July.Leicestershire Police said last week his death was not believed to be suspicious.Known as Dom, he had previously gained worldwide fame as the captain of The Wild Boars football team, or Moo Pa in Thai.He and his teammates became trapped in caves after a sudden storm caused flooding which blocked the exit.The boys, then aged between 11 and 16, and their 25-year-old coach spent nine days in darkness without food before they were found by an international search and rescue effort involving about 10,000 people.What happened next to the Thai cave rescue boys?Dom turned 13 while trapped in the cave and images of the boys were beamed across the world.They were sedated before being taken out of the cave one at a time by a team of divers.They left hospital a few weeks later after some contracted lung infections while they were trapped.Dom had enrolled as a student in the football academy at the college based in Market Harborough last year.In a statement released on 15 February, Ian Smith, principal at the college, said: ""This event has left our college community deeply saddened and shaken.""We unite in grief with all of Dom's family, friends, former teammates and those involved in all parts of his life, as well as everyone affected in any way by this loss in Thailand and throughout the college's global family.""The college is liaising with statutory authorities and the Royal Thai Embassy in London, and dedicating all resources to assist our student body, as they as young people process Dom's passing.""Beyond that, we are unable to comment further at this time and would ask for privacy and compassion as we continue to support the students in our care, drawing on the kindness and assistance of the Market Harborough community.""Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

59,Aziz Abdullah: Uyghur asylum-seeker death heaps pressure on Thailand,"The death of a 49-year-old Uyghur asylum-seeker in Thailand has prompted pleas from rights groups to find a humane solution to the plight of around 50 Uyghur men who have been detained for nine years. Aziz Abdullah died after he collapsed in the Immigration Detention Centre in Bangkok where he was being held. He was part of a wave of more than 350 Uyghur asylum-seekers who fled from Xinjiang in western China in 2013, and were detained in Thailand. China has been accused of committing crimes against humanity against Uyghur Muslims and other minorities in Xinjiang, where human rights groups believe more than a million people have been held in a vast network of detention camps in recent years. Beijing, which calls them ""re-education camps"", denies all allegations of abuse.  Aziz Abdullah had been a farmer in a remote part of south-western Xinjiang, and arrived in Thailand with his pregnant wife, his brother and seven children sometime in late 2013. Activists who have been in touch with inmates at the Immigration Detention Centre say he had been seriously ill for more than three weeks, but that the Thai authorities had refused to send him to hospital until he collapsed.""He was coughing and vomiting blood - he could not eat,"" says Polat Sayim, the Australia-based director of the Refugees Centre of the World Uyghur Congress. ""A doctor at the IDC examined him and said it was not a real sickness, that his condition was normal."" He was finally taken to hospital after his collapse, but pronounced dead soon afterwards. The death certificate issued by the hospital specifies a lung infection as the cause of death.Activists say his group was trying to reach Malaysia, and eventually Turkey, when they were intercepted in southern Thailand. At the time, most Uyghurs claimed to be Turkish to avoid being repatriated to China, and Turkey was giving some of them citizenship. In early July 2015 the Thai authorities allowed 173 of them, including Aziz Abdullah's wife and children, to be flown to Turkey.However, China objected strongly to this, accusing Turkey of interfering in a bilateral issue and of ""conniving in illegal immigration activities"". The Thai government had also allowed Chinese embassy officials to visit and assess the asylum-seekers, and on 8 July 2015, in defiance of pleas from the UN's refugee agency UNHCR and several governments, Thailand forcibly repatriated at least 109 Uyghur men, putting them on a plane, handcuffed and hooded, back to China. They included Aziz Abdullah's brother. They were described by Chinese state media as being members of people-smuggling gangs, with some accused of involvement in terrorism. There has been no information about the fate of the men after their arrival in China. The Thai government defended its decision, saying the Chinese had asked for all the Uyghurs to be repatriated, but that it had only sent some.Six weeks later, a powerful bomb exploded at a shrine in central Bangkok that was popular with Chinese visitors, killing 20 and injuring many others. The Thai government insisted that it was a consequence of rivalry among people-smuggling groups, but evidence that emerged afterwards pointed to Uyghur militant groups as the likely perpetrators. Two Uyghur men were detained and charged with the bombing, although one of them, who insists he is innocent, may just have been another asylum-seeker, caught when Thai police raided a house thought to have been used by the bomb-makers. Their trial has been repeatedly postponed, more than eight years after they were arrested; the Thai authorities seem in no hurry to finish it, and the two men are languishing in custody.Until last year the remaining 50 or so Uyghur detainees were being held in detention centres in different parts of Thailand, but after three of them managed to escape they were all moved to the notoriously overcrowded Immigration Detention Centre in Bangkok. Conditions are poor, say activists trying to help them, and the Uyghurs are kept separated from each other, with almost no contact with the outside world.""It is even worse than regular Thai prisons,"" says Chalida Tacharoensuk, from the People's Empowerment Foundation, which has been pushing for better treatment of the Uyghurs. ""It is very crowded. There is a lack of food, and the food provided is not healthy. There is no halal food for Muslim detainees. The drinks are not clean either - they have to drink tap water. There is barely any healthcare. If they get sick, they only get pain-killers or similar medications.""Phil Robertson from Human Rights Watch said: ""This death is an entirely predictable outcome of a Thai policy decision to lock away these Uyghurs and, essentially, to throw away the key. ""Clearly no thought was given to the health implications of indefinite detention in cramped, unsanitary immigration cells with wholly inadequate healthcare and nutrition.""The BBC tried calling a spokesman for the Bangkok IDC but was unable to get a response. A spokesman for the Thai police had no comment.The UNHCR says it has been allowed no access to the detainees. The Thai National Human Rights Commission has also been seeking permission to visit the Uyghurs in the IDC for several months. It was finally given a date this month, and will go in later this week. The Thai government has promised to work with the UN to improve the screening and treatment of the tens of thousands of refugees and asylum-seekers who are inside the country, but this has yet to bring any significant improvements to conditions inside the Bangkok IDC.Campaigners believe the Uyghurs would be very likely to get third country resettlement if Thailand was willing to release them. But, according to a well-placed Thai source, the government's concern over upsetting China is too great. Aziz Abdullah's body was eventually released to members of the Thai Muslim community, and he was buried in a cemetery at a mosque close to the Chao Phraya River in central Bangkok."

61,Thai cave rescue: Duangpetch Promthep's death shatters happiest of endings,"We still do not know what caused the sudden death of Duangpetch 'Dom' Promthep at the football academy in Britain to which he had been so proud to win a scholarship last year. It casts, for the first time, a sad shadow over a story which until now had not lost its power to inspire, to lift the spirits. The astonishing saga of the Thai boys rescued from the cave in July 2018 was that rarest of things in the news business: a tale with an almost flawlessly happy ending, although two Thai divers died, one during preparations for the rescue and one later from a blood infection picked up in the cave.When we first got news that a group of Thai footballers had gone missing, I had dashed with my colleagues up to Chiang Rai, and then to the entrance of the Tham Luang cave complex, carrying just three days of clothes. In my haste I had assumed few people around the world would care for long. The boys would be found, or perhaps they never would. That would be that. It was quite a misjudgement, and in the mud-soaked conditions outside the cave, I would come to regret my packing decisions. Five days later, with no indication that the boys were alive or where they might be, and Thai rescuers driven out of the cave by rising flood waters, I was interviewed by a Thai television team.  I found I was too emotional to respond. The boys were more or less the same age as my two sons. Dom was just 12 days older than my eldest. Reporting about them day and night, seeing their bikes still chained to the railings by the cave, they had become very precious lives. Against all the evidence, all of us hoped against hope that they might still be alive.And then that astonishing moment, when British divers John Volanthen and Rick Stanton found them, calling out in the dark, ""how many are you? Thirteen? Brilliant"". It seemed nothing less than a miracle. The journalists at the cave site multiplied quickly, far more than it could accommodate. But we knew getting the boys out would be difficult. So difficult, in fact, that the divers had told the Thai government getting even half of them out alive should be considered a success. By now they were the most famous boys in the world. All of Thailand was rooting for them. For days the Thai authorities had pushed for a zero-risk option - leaving the boys there until the monsoon rains stopped four months later, even though they were warned this was a near-certain death sentence. Their lives had become too precious.And when they eventually went for the high-risk, improvised rescue plan, and we watched the boys and their coach being brought out, heavily sedated, one by one over three days, it seemed impossible they had all survived.But they did. And within days they were charming the world in their first appearance before the media, smiling, joking, knocking footballs around. The Thai government took control at that point, leading the lucrative negotiations with Hollywood filmmakers and organising overseas trips. Yet none of that ever spoiled them.They remained small-town boys with a few big dreams - polite, grateful for the effort so many had made to save them, and for the new opportunities their story had brought them to travel and study, but always refreshingly down-to-earth. Even the fear that fame would inevitably tarnish the fairy tale proved unfounded.When he won the scholarship to go to Britain last year, Dom thanked Zico, the former Thai national team captain who had arranged it, and promised to study hard there. ""I will do my level best,"" he wrote. No-one who watched him and his team-mates dealing so modestly with all the attention that came their way can doubt that he would have lived up to that promise."

63,"Thai cave rescue: Duangphet Phromthep, Wild Boars captain, dies in UK","Duangphet Phromthep, one of the 12 boys who was rescued from a Thai cave in 2018, has died in the UK.  The 17-year-old was found unconscious in his dorm in Leicestershire on Sunday and taken to hospital, where he died on Tuesday, the BBC has been told.He had been enrolled in a football academy in the UK since late last year.He was captain of the Thai boys' football team, which was trapped deep inside a cave for over two weeks while exploring in Chiang Rai province. His grinning face, caught by the torch light of a diver after the boys were found in the cave, was one of the most memorable images from the rescue. What happened next to the Thai cave rescue boys?It is not known how the teenager died, but Leicestershire Police said his death is not being treated as suspicious. Reports in Thailand said he suffered a head injury.Phromthep was driven by ambulance to Kettering General Hospital on Sunday afternoon, a spokesperson for East Midlands Ambulance Service said. An air ambulance was also sent to the scene.In August last year, his team mates rejoiced when Phromthep, who they call Dom, announced on Instagram that he had won a scholarship to join the Brooke House College Football Academy in Market Harborough. ""Today my dream has come true,"" he wrote. Just six months on, they are mourning the loss of their friend. News of his death emerged after his mother informed the Wat Doi Wao temple in his hometown in Chiang Rai, which the team frequented. The temple expressed condolences on Facebook - ""May Dom's soul rest in peace,"" said the post, which was accompanied by pictures of the football team with monks.Soon, messages began pouring in from his team mates. ""You told me to wait and see you play for the national team, I always believe that you would do it,"" wrote Prachak Sutham, one of the boys who was rescued with Phromthep in 2018.""When we met the last time before you left for England, I even jokingly told you that when you come back, I would have to ask for your autograph. ""Sleep well, my dear friend. We will always have 13 of us together."" Another of the boys, Titan Chanin Viboonrungruang, wrote: ""Brother, you told me that we would be achieving our football dream... if the next world is real, I want us to play football together again, my brother Dom.""Principal of Brooke House College, Ian Smith, said they were ""deeply saddened and shaken"" by the death.""We unite in grief with all of Dom's family, friends, former teammates and those involved in all parts of his life, as well as everyone affected in any way by this loss in Thailand and throughout the college's global family,"" he said.In a tweet, British Ambassador to Thailand Mark Gooding passed on ""his condolences to all his friends and family.""Phromthep studied in Vachiralai Bee School in Chiang Mai before he went to the UK. A diehard football fan, he had been a member of a youth team in Chiang Mai.His Instagram account is filled with posts on the sport, often accompanied with the hashtag #footballismylife. One of his last posts in January shows a sketch of his ""dream team's football kit"" - jersey, shorts, socks and shoes with blue and pink stripes. After football practice on 23 June 2018, the Wild Boars (Moo Pa in Thai) football team - of which Phromthep was captain - raced to the Tham Luang cave on their bicycles. It was one of the team's favourite haunts.But a sudden storm caused the narrow passageways in the cave system to flood, trapping the boys and their coach inside. They spent nine days in darkness and without food - while a desperate search effort involving some 10,000 people went on - before they were found by divers. Phromthep turned 13 while he was trapped in the cave. His teammates were aged between 11 and 16 at the time, while their coach Ekkaphon Kanthawong was 25.The boys used rocks to dig holes to escape, while their coach taught them meditation techniques to help them stay calm and use as little air as possible. Divers sent them food and letters from their family even as they planned the rescue. They were eventually brought out after being sedated with the drug ketamine.The rescue made headlines around the world, and various films and books were later made to retell the extraordinary story, including a six-episode miniseries that Netflix released last year."
64,What happened next to the Thai cave rescue boys?,"In June 2018, the story of Duangpetch Promthep and 11 other young Thai footballers gripped the world. For more than two weeks, the team's fate hung in the balance, as a diving team assembled from around the world sought to rescue the Wild Boars team from the Tham Luang cave.As the world watched, the boys and their coach were removed from the cave one by one while sedated with the drug ketamine.But for the boys - who were aged between 11 and 16 - their escape marked the beginning of a new challenge: dealing with the fascination of the world's media. Having followed their ordeal for almost three weeks, global news organisations sought every detail of the team's experience. In 2019, the players agreed to a six-part Netflix documentary series after the Thai government struck a deal which reportedly saw each child's family paid $94,000 (£72,000). The show came out last year.Separately, Thirteen Lives - a Ron Howard film, starring Colin Farrell - was also released in 2022.Last year, Chanin ""Titan"" Wibunrungrueang - the youngest of the boys - told the BBC he had found the post-rescue attention challenging. ""At first it was very difficult, I had to to adjust myself,"" he said. ""A lot of people knew about me and I didn't know how to act... I felt tense when I was in front of the camera or being interviewed."" Four years later, Titan still plays football with an academy run by Ekkapol Chantawong - the coach trapped with the boys. Mr Chantawong was just 25 at the time. A former monk, he helped the boys keep calm and minimise the air they consumed by teaching them meditation tricks. At the time of the rescue, Mr Chantawong and three of his players - including Monkol Boonpiam, the last boy rescued from the cave - were stateless, despite being born in Thailand.But they were granted full Thai citizenship in the months that followed. After escaping from the cave, Mr Chantawong set up his  football academy to help young Thai children reach their potential.""I'm really proud because some of the kids get to their goals,"" he told the BBC in July. ""Some of them want to be professional footballers and play at the highest level."" But he added that for others, he was there to provide an outlet while they ""study and complete their education"".One of the Wild Boars, and another of those who were stateless, was Adul Sam-On. The only member of the group who could speak English, Adul greeted the international diving team when they breached the cave, and relayed their instructions to his teammates. Last year, the New York Times reported that Adul - who can speak five languages - was studying in New York on a full scholarship. His great-uncle and guardian, Go Shin Maung, told the paper his nephew wanted to work for the UN. ""The boys are going their own ways,"" Mr Go told the paper. ""Some will pursue their studies and some are following football. They still chat and message with each other, sharing their experiences.""According to his Instagram, Phonchai Khamluang - one of Adul's teammates - played professional football with Thai third division side Chiangrai Lanna.And several other boys are still involved in the sport at various levels. As was Duangpetch Promthep, who was found dead in Leicestershire on Wednesday. Aged just 12 when he got trapped, ""Dom"" was the team's standout star and captain. Last August, his talent was recognised then he won a scholarship to join the Brooke House College Football Academy.The outfit boasts a star-studded alumni, including Jesse Sekidika - who went on to play for Turkish giants Galatasaray - and Kelvin John of Belgian side Genk. ""Today my dream has come true,"" Dom wrote on Instagram when his scholarship was announced.His talent - and popularity - were highlighted in the tributes from former teammates.""You told me to wait and see you play for the national team,"" wrote Prachak Sutham, who had been trapped in the cave with Promthep. ""I always believed you would do it.""While Wednesday's tragedy has brought renewed attention to the Wild Boars, they are unlikely to give a wide range of new interviews. ""They have no hang-ups about what happened,"" Vern Unsworth - a cave explorer who helped recruit the rescue team - told the New York Times last year.""They haven't put themselves on a pedestal. They have remained very low key. They have just tried to get on with life as best they can."""

66,British police head to Thailand over woman's 2004 Yorkshire Dales death,"Cold case officers have travelled to Thailand to speak with the husband and family of a woman found dead in the Yorkshire Dales almost 19 years ago.Walkers discovered the half-naked body of Lamduan Armitage, nee Seekanya, in a stream near Pen-y-ghent in 2004.For 15 years her identity was unknown until family in Thailand came forward and DNA proved it was their daughter.As well as her parents, police are hoping to speak to husband David Armitage who now lives in Thailand.North Yorkshire officers, who arrived in the country on Sunday, said being there was a crucial next step in their attempts to finally solve the case. Adam Harland, manager of the major investigation team's cold case review unit, said: ""To understand Lamduan's life we need to speak to the people who knew her.""We can't move forward without understanding from Lamduan's family all the aspects about her life and particularly the last few months of her life.""A post-mortem carried out after she was found on 20 September 2004 failed to establish how she died.There was no sign of violence and hypothermia was ruled out, but detectives could not answer two main questions; who she was or how she met her death.Local people paid for her burial in the churchyard in Horton-in-Ribblesdale and she became known as The Lady of the Hills. A cold case review was started in 2016 and scientific advances meant police were able to piece together a more detailed picture of who she was and came to the conclusion she had been killed.In 2019, there was a major breakthrough when a Thai family read a BBC online story about the case and believed the woman could be their daughter who vanished in 2004.This led North Yorkshire Police to carry out DNA testing with the parents in order to confirm Ms Armitage's identity.It was established she had moved to the UK in 1991 with Mr Armitage after they were married in Thailand and they had been living in northern England before her death.Mr Armitage, who later returned to Thailand, has previously said he was not involved in his wife's death, according to The Sun.The investigation has been at a standstill for three years because attempts by police to travel to the country were delayed by the legal permissions needed and travel restrictions imposed due to Covid.Mr Harland said getting to Thailand was what ""they had been waiting to do for what seems like a lifetime"".He added: ""We want to build up a picture of what Lamduan was like, what was going on in her life and try and find some explanation for why she ended up in a beautiful but remote spot on the Yorkshire Dales.""Follow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

67,Convicted Essex drug gang boss arrested in Thailand,"A drug gang boss who has been on the run for five years has been arrested in Thailand, the National Crime Agency (NCA) has said.Richard Wakeling, 55, of Brentwood, Essex, fled the country in January 2018 on the eve of his trial.He was convicted in his absence of trying to import £8m of amphetamines in 2016 and jailed for 11 years in April 2018 at Chelmsford Crown Court.Wakeling had been on the NCA's most wanted list.He was arrested by Thai police on Friday at a Bangkok garage as he went to collect his car after repairs.The NCA said he was found in possession of a passport in another identity.Wakeling, who had been living in the beachside town of Hua Hin, remains in custody and extradition proceedings are under way.David Coyle, NCA regional manager for Thailand, said: ""The NCA has worked relentlessly to trace Wakeling and ensure he returns to the UK to serve his prison sentence.""In 2019 the NCA issued an appeal for help finding Wakeling and released CCTV footage of him before he fled.It began its investigation into Wakeling's organised crime group after Border Force colleagues stopped a truck boarding a Channel Tunnel train on 9 April 2016.The truck contained plastic drums carrying the drugs.The driver was transporting furniture from Italy but stopped at Ternat in Belgium where phone evidence showed he was directed to collect the drugs.The entire importation was set up by Wakeling.He was in contact with drug suppliers in the Netherlands and liaised with two other UK offenders to arrange the journey.Officers believe the crime group had organised at least six other importations before the 2016 seizure.Jacque Beer, NCA regional head of investigations, said: ""Wakeling's arrest was the culmination of the NCA conducting enquiries around the world to capture him.""Wakeling had links to Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, Canada, Spain and Thailand. ""We pursued these connections and worked with partners from all those countries to help build the intelligence picture around him.""We have been supported by the public who responded to the media and Crimewatch appeals to provide intelligence all of which has ultimately led to his capture.""Lorry drivers Lesley Muffett, 59, of Campbell Road, Witham, and Stuart Davidson, 65, of Chesham Drive, Basildon, as well as Darren Keane, 34, of Kiln Drive, Milton Keynes, were convicted of their involvement alongside the absent Wakeling after a 12-week trial. Keane was jailed for nine years, Davidson to eight years and Muffett for six years for conspiring to import drugs.Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

68,Dramatic rescue saves Thai baby who fell down well,"A baby girl has been rescued by authorities after she fell down a deep well in northern Thailand. The 19-month-old child fell down the 13m (42ft) deep shaft while playing on Monday afternoon in Tak province, near the Myanmar border. Authorities launched an overnight rescue operation after the girl's parents - who had been working in a nearby field - raised the alarm. She was taken to hospital and treated for minor injuries, officials said. ""She has signs of fatigue but still has good vital signs,"" local police chief Ratsaran Ketsoising told AFP.Panic was sparked after the baby girl - who is said to be the daughter of two Myanmarese migrants - fell through a 30cm (12in) wide gap at the top of the well. The baby's parents said they had taken her to work with them at a tapioca farm in the Khiri Rat sub-district. They said they had left her under a tree while they worked. But they raised the alarm after they were unable to find the child during their break and heard cries coming from the nearby well. Rescue teams were forced to work through the night using a mechanical digger, with which they dug a 10m deep pit adjacent to the well shaft. Oxygen was pumped into the well to allow the child to breathe. Images at the scene showed rescue workers in hard hats working at the bottom of a deep pit.But authorities told local media that they feared that the well could collapse in on itself and harm the child if they continued to use the digger, so they used hand-held shovels to remove the final few metres of earth. PBS Thailand reported that rescue workers reached the child at about 08:00 local time (01:00 GMT), but were unable to pull her out immediately, as she appeared to have suffered an injury to her leg. However, cheers erupted shortly afterwards from the assembled rescue workers after the girl was finally pulled from the well. ""We are so glad we could rescue her safely,"" rescue worker Chanachart Wancharernrung told reporters. ""We have been trying since yesterday afternoon. We worked without sleep. Everyone helped out."""

70,Covid: Thailand tourism up but still below pre-pandemic level,"Thailand says tourist numbers jumped last year, as coronavirus restrictions were eased, but remained way below pre-pandemic levels.The South East Asia holiday destination saw 11.81m tourists in 2022 - up from just 400,000 the previous year.The Tourism Authority of Thailand also forecast that figure will more than double to 25m this year.However, those figures are still much lower than the record 39.8m tourists Thailand saw in 2019.The country is set to start charging overseas visitors 300 baht ($9.20; £7.40) each from the start of June.Thailand now has a target to increase tourist numbers to 80m a year by 2027.Tourism revenue accounted for more than 10% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019. In 2021 it was just 1%. GDP, which measures all economic activity, is an important tool for looking at how well, or badly, an economy is doing.Uncertain fate awaits Thailand's elephant tourismBy aiming to more than double the number of people who visited before the pandemic, the Thai government hopes to see tourism spending rise above $150bn.""This target, once achieved, could raise the country's tourism revenue to 5tn baht in 2027,"" the government's Public Relations Department said in a Facebook post.The announcement also said Thailand plans to upgrade ""tourism safety standards in order to accommodate the influx of visitors.""This month the country announced, but then quickly withdrew, a decision to request proof of Covid-19 vaccination for visitors entering Thailand.Like much of South East Asia, Thailand is expected to see a jump in tourist numbers from China, which dropped the strict border controls it put in place during the pandemic.In December China's immigration administration said passport applications for its citizens wishing to travel internationally would resume from 8 January.The announcement brought to an end almost three years of strict quarantine rules for arrivals and prompted a rush of people booking overseas trips, with travel sites reporting a spike in traffic.Before the pandemic China was Thailand's biggest source of tourists, with almost 11m visitors in 2019. This year the country is expecting at least five million Chinese tourists."

Following the crash on the island of Ko Tao, he remains in a hospital in Koh Samui, with his parents at his bedside.In addition to fractures to his skull, he has bleeding on the brain, a punctured lung, broken ribs, a broken clavicle, a broken scapula and a fractured ankle.""He was on a little island and he was driving a scooter and he just, I think he came round a bend and just went straight in to an electric pole,"" said Jess.""We didn't find out until it was 24 hours after. He had to be shipped to another island because there was no hospital there and he had multiple injuries, some major injuries and his insurance wouldn't cover him.""Jess has managed to raise £20,000 for her brother through an online fundraising page, but she is urging other travellers to be more cautious.""It was something in the small print. He took out an insurance policy which enabled him to travel worldwide, that's how it was sold. But it would only insure him for one country for 31 consecutive days.""She's urged others to study the ""small print"" of policies before travelling.""I know it's annoying to look through… nobody really reads the small print, but I urge everybody to do it. Even if it takes half an hour, it's worth it. Family friend, Lucie Macleod, 23, said no one expected the policy to have such a clause, which is why it is important to read the whole thing.""Nobody would have ever thought that one of the caveats would be that every 30 days you would have to land back in the UK,"" said Lucie.""It was worldwide insurance, and for a year. It seemed convenient to have the same bank and same insurance. Everybody should definitely read the small print.""Jess has thanked the hundreds of people that have raised the more than £20,000 for her brother's medical care.""People worldwide have helped out and we're just amazed and overwhelmed by all the help we've had really and the support,"" she added.""It reached the target within 24 hours, which was £15,000, and it's up to £20,000 now and keeps on climbing.

75,Elephants: Covid and ethics reshape Thailand's tourism industry,"As he ambles in for his annual health check, Kwanmueang's size takes your breath away. Nearly three metres high at the shoulder, weighing at least four tonnes, and with spectacular tusks that curve together until they almost touch, the 18-year-old Thai bull elephant is an imposing sight.  Yet he and his keeper, or mahout, Sornsiri ""Lek"" Sapmak, are in trouble. They used to make a living by having Kwanmueang take part in ceremonies to ordain new monks, or dress up as a war elephant for re-enacting historic battles. All that stopped during the Covid lockdowns. More elephants are used for tourism in Thailand - over 3,000 - than anywhere else. Unlike other countries with captive populations, those in Thailand are nearly all privately owned. So the collapse of tourism during the pandemic has had a devastating impact on the elephants and their owners, who no longer earn enough to look after them. Even as tourism starts to recover, another threat hangs over this unique industry. Ethical concerns over how captive animals are kept and trained are prompting many foreign visitors to boycott the elephant shows, which were once a staple of tour groups, raising questions over whether elephant tourism can ever go back to what it was before Covid. Lek and Kwanmueang have come back to Lek's home village in Surin province - a region whose people are famed for their skill in keeping, training, and in the past capturing, elephants.  Lek is not alone. Hundreds of other elephants have returned to Surin from tourist hot spots like Phuket and Chiang Mai, where they made money by performing tricks or giving rides to foreign visitors. Walking through these villages is a disarming experience. Nearly every house has one or more elephants chained up in their front yards, or resting under trees. You get used to seeing the huge animals plodding along the road, their mahouts straddling their broad necks, and when driving you learn to take care to move around them. Boonyarat ""Joy"" Salangam owns four elephants, which she and her partner brought back from Phuket when tourism dried up in 2020. One is a playful baby, penned in with its mother in an enclosure Joy built in front of her house. ""Covid stopped everything,"" she says. ""The mahouts, owners and elephants have all been unemployed. In the tourist camps the females are kept apart from the bulls, but here we have all been hanging out together, and the elephants have been having sex. We don't force them. They do it in their own time. So the population is increasing."" Joy says she thought about selling her baby elephant to raise funds - they can fetch as much as a luxury car - but worried about how well he would be looked after. Joy has lived with his mother, who is 39 years old, nearly all of her life, and inherited her from her grandparents.  The mahouts too may live for decades with the same elephant from when they are both young, sometimes choosing to sleep with them, taking them to lakes or rivers to bathe in the evening, and keeping a close eye on their health. That has been a challenge under Covid.Elephants are expensive. An adult needs to eat 100-200kg (220-440lb) of food a day, and drinks up to 100 litres (22 gallons) of water. Without any other income, owners like Joy have been livestreaming their animals on social media, while appealing for donations. Sometimes this is done at home, as the elephants play or bathe, or they get a friend to ride a motorbike alongside them to film them on their evening walks. Viewers can pay online for the elephants to earn baskets of bananas by performing tricks, but this is not ideal for their health. Their diet should mainly be different kinds of leaves and grass, but with so many elephants coming back to the area it is hard to find enough for them.  ""We are finding they have digestive problems, because of the change in diet,"" says Nuttapon Bangkaew, a vet giving free check-ups offered by Elephant Kingdom, a project started seven years ago to improve the welfare of elephants in Surin. ""When the mahouts or elephant owners come back home, they don't have any income. So, they don't have money to buy grass or food for them. They have to do these social media livestreams to make money, but this causes health problems."" Elephants are native to Thailand, but the wild population has shrunk from around 100,000 a century ago, to perhaps only 3,000-4,000 today. In the past large numbers were captured and used in the logging industry, but when that was banned in the late 1980s to protect what remained of the country's forests, they started being used to entertain tourists instead. In the earliest shows, they demonstrated their skill with logs. But these expanded, as Thailand's tourism boomed, to offering rides, or antics such as having the animals paint or play football. The campaigning group World Animal Protection (WAP) estimates that before Covid elephants generated up to $770m (£626m) a year for Thailand.  WAP is one of a number of groups trying to end the use of elephants for entertainment, arguing that it is unnatural, and always involves cruel training techniques. Many tourists are already seeking more ethical ways to experience elephants in Thailand. Some tour groups in Europe and North America will no longer send clients to elephant camps which include riding or bathing. So a new niche has emerged in the eco-tourism industry to meet these concerns.  Saengduean ""Lek"" Chailert, a pioneer in ethical elephant tourism, opened the Elephant Nature Park, north of Chiang Mai, in the 1990s - both as a refuge for injured animals and to explore better ways to allow tourists and elephants to interact. ""We wanted to go fully ethical, to focus on conservation. So we decided to stop the programmes of elephant baths and feeding for tourists,"" she said. That cost them half their bookings. And, she adds, tour operators said they couldn't send clients to them because everyone ""wants to touch and hug the elephants, they want to put their hands on them"".  But today, Lek says, there are signs everywhere in Chiang Mai advertising ""no bull-hooks, no chains, no riding"".  ""I checked in Koh Samui - before there were so many camps doing elephant riding. Now there are only two players left. In Phuket, only a few places are left, and in Chiang Mai, just two places."" However, ethical elephant tourism has its limits. Out of more than 200 camps which were operating before the Covid shutdown, only 11, including Lek's, get the WAP's approval.  Lek has a large plot of land, around 100 hectares (250 acres), along the Mae Taeng river. That is just about enough space for the 122 elephants she has - 45 of them rescued from bankrupt businesses during Covid - to be able to wander freely without being chained.Other camps do not have that option. One, also in Chiang Mai, which advertises ""ethical elephant tours"", does allow bathing with humans. It says that because it does not have the means to build a sufficiently large enclosure it has to chain them in the evening, for the safety of the elephants and humans. Some in the industry say this is all right; that there needs to be a more balanced approach between the abuses which used to characterise the industry and the demand of animal rights groups that all elephant entertainment should end.  ""Riding elephants can be part of a system for taking care of them,"" says Theerapat Trungprakan, who heads the Thai Elephant Alliance Association, a group of elephant owners and business operators.  ""They get to go to different places, going to a waterfall, for example, where they can drink the best quality water, or swimming there. It also increases the safety for the elephant to go with humans because there are dangers like pesticides or electricity cables beyond an elephant's judgement.""  He describes some of the arguments made by animal rights groups as emotional and melodramatic, and believes that ethical sanctuaries can be less healthy, because without humans being paid to ride them the elephants get fewer opportunities to take long walks. There are two debates now hanging over the future of Thailand's captive elephants. One is over what humans should and should not be allowed to do with them. The other, larger question is over what practical options there are for supporting such a massive population of large and long-lived animals.   ""I have a wish list in my head, and on top of the wish list is to end the captivity of all wildlife, but we just know that that's not going to happen,"" says Edwin Wiek, one of the most prominent anti-trafficking campaigners in Thailand.  He started the Wildlife Friends Foundation of Thailand 21 years ago to rescue animals that were injured and kept illegally. He has 24 rescued elephants that roam freely in a 16-hectare corral. ""The ideal scenario would be having elephants semi-wild, like we keep them here, in large natural enclosures where they can hang around, bathe, run or forage for food, as they would in nature."" But he realises that would be a costly project with few takers given Thailand is home to 3,000 captive elephants.  ""I'm afraid that the majority of elephants, three-quarters of them at least, will still need to find alternative income. And that means there will still be a lot of places where elephant rides, elephant bathing and feeding by tourists will be part of daily routine."" This is all the more likely to happen when tourists from markets like China, Russia and India start travelling to Thailand again, as they tend to enjoy the old-fashioned elephant entertainment shows more, which are often included on their package tours.  What Edwin Wiek believes should happen is for the breeding of domestic elephants to stop - so that the population falls to a level where they can all be kept in those ideal, semi-wild conditions, visited by the smaller number of tourists willing to pay just to see, not touch them. Then, he says, the government could turn its attention to managing a growing wild population by creating corridors that allow them to move between Thailand's national parks and fragments of forest without coming into conflict with humans.  But Thailand has no strategy in place for that. In fact, regulation of domestic elephants is a muddle, divided between three ministries which do not co-ordinate with each other.  So the future of these magnificent creatures is left largely with their owners, many of them still in precarious financial shape.  The mahouts are counting the days until the tourists come back in the numbers they used to, but also worry that the only business many of them know may be threatened by changing tastes. Bringing her elephants back to Surin from Phuket cost Joy more than $2,000. She says she cannot afford to return there until she is sure the shows are getting big crowds again. ""Right now it is very difficult for us, because we don't have enough money. The elephants and humans are both unemployed. Will there still be shows? I think there will, but not so many, because some foreign tourists think we, those who keep elephants, do not love them, that we torture them with bull-hooks to make them perform. I think things will change."""

The hotel-casino employs 400 workers and had many Thai nationals as guests.Many of the victims are thought to have been trapped on upper floors and a Thai volunteer organisation, Ruamkatanyu Foundation, said it was unlikely that they could have survived.""I witnessed people running out of the building to escape from the smoke,"" one volunteer from the foundation said. ""Then we saw some people jumping down.""""There are 19 dead so far as we see bodies and bones,"" said Sek Sokhom, director of Cambodia's Banteay Meanchey provincial information department. He warned that the death toll could be higher.Rescue teams had struggled to reach people inside the building because of the dense smoke and are continuing to search it for those who are missing. Poipet is a key crossing point between the two countries. It is also popular for its casinos, which many Thai nationals visit because gambling is mostly illegal in Thailand. The building backs on to the Thai border and many of the injured were sent across the border for treatment. Some were sent to a hospital in the nearby town of Aranyaprathet.However, the exact number of people injured is unclear - with the numbers given by local officials and quoted by the media varying greatly. It's thought to be in the dozens.Authorities are still working to determine the cause of the blaze."

The navy says 76 crew members have been rescued in total.The HTMS Sukhothai went down on Sunday night with 105 crew on board after losing power in a storm.The Thai navy and air force have spent two days searching for survivors, with hundreds of officers on four navy ships as well as several helicopters and unmanned drones deployed to scan a 50-sq-km (30-sq-mile) area of ocean.""The latest person was found 41 hours from when the ship sank and he was alive. So we believe that there are those still alive out there... we will continue to search,"" said Admiral Chonlathis Navanugraha, the navy's chief of staff.A naval commander had earlier suggested search crews had only a two-day window to find anyone alive, given the time they had spent in the ocean. Several sailors have already been found, exhausted and unconscious in some cases. Not all of those missing are wearing life vests.""We found this guy holding a life buoy... he was floating in the water for 10 hours,"" Captain Krapich Korawee-Paparwit of the HTMS Kraburi told Reuters.He added that the man, still conscious, had a minor head wound and ""sore eyes as he was exposed to sea water.""Other sailors were found in a life raft after they jumped from the sinking vessel. Pictures and footage shared by the navy on Twitter show survivors wrapped in blankets and being taken to hospital. Navy officials initially said 106 people were on board the ship, but revised that number to 105 on Tuesday.The HTMS Sukhothai, a 76m-long corvette, had been on day two of a routine patrol when it went down. The navy said water flooded its hull and then the electricity room, cutting the power.Dramatic pictures posted on the navy's Twitter account show the vessel listing onto its starboard side, before it went under around 23:30 local time (16:30 GMT) on Sunday.Other naval ships were immediately alerted and sent to assist, but only the HTMS Kraburi frigate reached the boat before it sank, about 32km (20 miles) east of Bang Saphan in Prachuap Khiri Khan province.It is not yet known what caused the ship to flood, and why sailors were forced to jump into the water. The Thai navy said this was the first time it had lost a vessel in such circumstances, and it would launch an investigation.However, naval experts have questioned how such a disaster struck a ship on a routine patrol.""It's really unusual,"" said naval law expert David Letts, an associate professor at the Australian National University.He noted there were measures to prevent flooding affecting central units like the engine room.""The ship's divided into compartments - and there should be a series of watertight doors that start on the upper deck, so the ocean doesn't get down into the ship itself.""  The fact the disaster struck at night meant it was probable many sailors would have been asleep at the time, and the chaotic situation might have upended protocols like getting crew to upper decks or releasing life rafts.The warship had been commissioned in 1987 and built in the United States by a local shipbuilding company, said the US Naval Institute."
81,Thailand warship capsizes leaving 31 sailors missing,"The Thai navy says 31 sailors are missing after a warship carrying more than 100 crew capsized and sank during a storm in the Gulf of Thailand.HTMS Sukhothai sank after water flooded its power controls on Sunday night. Images shared by the navy showed some crew who survived in a life raft.On Monday, authorities said they had rescued 75 sailors, but 31 were still missing in rough seas.""We will keep looking,"" a navy spokesman told the BBC.Search crews worked through the night to find survivors, with the operation continuing on Monday with air force assistance.The navy also announced an investigation into the cause of the disaster.""This has almost never happened in our force's history, especially to a ship that is still in active use,"" spokesman Admiral Pogkrong Monthardpalin told the BBC.Footage shared by the navy on Twitter showed crew members wrapped in blankets and receiving treatment after they had been rescued. Some were being airlifted to hospital. Other images showed sailors from the Sukhothai in a life raft, having jumped from the sinking vessel. One unnamed crew member said he had been in the water for several hours before he was rescued.""The waves were quite high, about three metres when the ship sank,"" he said in a clip shared on local media. ""I put on the life jacket and jumped. I swam for three hours."" Officials said the ship went down after it took on water, which flooded its hull and short-circuited its power room.With the power lost, the crew battled to retain control of the ship which listed on to its side before sinking around 23:30 local time Sunday (16:30 GMT).The ship had been on a patrol 32km (20 miles) east of Bang Saphan, in the Prachuap Khiri Khan province, when it got caught in the storm on Sunday.Dramatic pictures posted on the Thai Navy's Twitter account show the vessel listing onto its side, and back-up rescue ships trying to find survivors in choppy waters.Three naval ships and helicopters were sent to assist, but only warship HTMS Kraburi reached the vessel before it sank. The frigate picked up most of the Sukhothai's crew, the navy said. Sailors wearing life jackets were found in the water and in life rafts. The navy has disclosed scant detail on their condition. Local media published pictures showing medical personnel at the dock taking crew members off in stretchers. Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-Cha released a statement on Monday confirming officials were investigating the disaster. ""I am following the news closely - about five people are seriously injured,"" he said."

83,Armagh man Odhran O'Neill dies in kayaking incident in Thailand,"A 22-year old man has died after his boat capsized while kayaking in Thailand. Odhran O'Neill from Lurgan, County Armagh was last seen in Khao Sok National Park on Saturday at 13:00 GMT. Mr O'Neill's uncle David O'Dowd told the BBC his nephew was only 4.5m (15ft) from a jetty when his boat capsized.He had taken a break from an apprenticeship in Newry to travel to Thailand with a friend last week. The pair had based themselves outside Bangkok and had been planning to travel around the country for a few months.Mr O'Dowd said the family was currently working to have Mr O'Neill's body repatriated.He said it was expected to take between seven and 10 days.A statement from Clann Eireann GAC said after the kayak capsized, Mr O'Neill said he would swim to shore but was not seen again.It is believed his body was found in the early hours of Sunday morning.The club thanked everyone who assisted the search efforts by sharing the social media post and said their thoughts and prayers were with the family. ""Unfortunately, it is not the outcome we had all hoped and prayed for,"" the statement added."
84,Woman breaks nearly every bone in face in Thailand,"A student is asking for help to pay her sister's medical bills, after she suffered a horrific accident while on holiday.Jo Hoffman from Wolverhampton came off her hired scooter while in Thailand, smashing nearly every bone in her face. She is currently in hospital in Koh Samui, where medical experts from Bangkok came out to try and help her.She has since found out she is not covered by her travel insurance and her medical bills could reach £50,000.The total required already stands at £35,000. Well wishers have raised about £11,000 in a bid to help.Ms Hoffman, 28, who had worked in social care, had arrived in Thailand with her boyfriend early in December. She had been planning an extended trip and had hoped to go New Zealand later.On 7 December the couple hired a scooter for a day's exploring, but it skidded on some sand in the road, her sister Geneva Hoffman said.Jo suffered severe injuries, despite the fact she had been wearing a helmet. She also broke four discs in her spine and has hurt her arm.In her own words on a fundraising page she said nothing could have prepared her for the sheer force of the crash which flung her into the air and drove her face into the concrete floor.""Neither of us lost consciousness but part of me wished I had,"" she wrote.""Buzzing in my head, terror in my heart, blood dripping from every orifice imaginable yet I couldn't recognise my own voice.""She eventually got to hospital where she was told about her injuries and advised she needed emergency facial reconstruction and that her jaw may need to be wired shut.""But time just ticked on as they vigorously checked travel insurance documents whilst I lay there waiting for treatment in agony,"" she wrote.""My heart shattered when we were told that our insurance policies were invalid and my Amex card did not offer the protections I thought it did.""I admit that I'm lucky to be alive but the mounting medical bills presented to me on a daily basis fill my heart with dread and fear as I know such a sum of money will take me a lifetime to repay.""Geneva, who has set up the fundraising page, said her sister is a sensible person, a worrier and the sort of person who usually looks after everyone else.She said her sister had got confused about what the policies protected her for and that her type of Amex card was not one that offered travel insurance as she had thought.""There is not much we can do - other than try and fundraise and try and remove that worry from her,"" she said.""I want to thank everyone for all the support we have received so far.""Jo's boyfriend was not as seriously hurt in the crash and is still in Thailand helping to look after her.Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

85,"Thai princess collapses from heart condition, palace says","The Thai King's eldest daughter collapsed from a heart condition on Wednesday evening, Thailand's royal palace says.Princess Bajrakitiyabha, the eldest daughter of King Vajiralongkorn, collapsed while training her dogs north-east of Bangkok, the palace said. The 44-year-old was taken to a nearby hospital, then taken by helicopter to Bangkok, where she is being treated. The palace described her condition last night as ""stable to a certain extent"". Medical bulletins from the royal palace in Thailand are typically vague and cryptic, and from the single statement issued about Princess Bajrakitiyabha, it is difficult to gauge how serious her condition is, says the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok. The statement says nothing about her state of health now. Some reports have suggested it is a lot more serious than stated. The princess is the daughter of the king's first wife Princess Soamsawali, and his eldest child. She has been a part of her father's innermost circle since he succeeded King Bhumibol in 2016, and has been made a senior officer in the king's personal guard. She is the most visibly accomplished of the inner royal circle, with post-graduate degrees in law from two US universities.King Vajiralongkorn has not yet named an heir to the throne, but Princess Bajrakitiyabha is widely viewed as the most suitable successor. Being one of the king's three children who have formal titles, she is eligible for the throne under a 1924 Palace Law of Succession.She is a fitness enthusiast and also has a long record of advocating penal reform in Thailand. She is especially vocal for female prisoners, of which Thailand has one of the world's highest populations. She was Thailand's ambassador to Austria from 2012 to 2014. "
86,Thai monks fail drug tests leaving temple empty,"A small Buddhist temple in Thailand has been left without any monks after they were all dismissed for failing drug tests, local officials have said. Four monks, including the abbot, tested positive for methamphetamine in the northern province of Phetchabun, an official told news agency AFP. Boonlert Thintapthai said the monks were subsequently sent to a health clinic to undergo drug rehabilitation. The raid comes amid a national campaign to tackle drug trafficking. The monks were reportedly removed from the temple after police administered urine tests on Monday, which saw all four men fail. Officials did not say what had brought the temple to the attention of police. Mr Thintapthai told AFP that the ""temple is now empty of monks and nearby villagers are concerned they cannot do any merit-making"". Merit-making is an important Buddhist practice where worshippers gain a protective force through good deeds - in this case by giving food to monks. But Mr Thintapthai said that regional officials had sought the assistance of the local monastic chief, who had promised to assign some new monks to the temple in the Bung Sam Phan district in a bid to address the concerns of worshippers. In recent years, methamphetamine has become a major issue in Thailand, with seizures of the drug reaching an all time high in 2021, according to the UN's Office on Drugs and Crime. The country is a major transit point for methamphetamine. The drugs flood into the country from Myanmar - the world's biggest producer of methamphetamine - via Laos. The pills are then sold on the streets with a value of around 50 Baht ($1.40; £1.17). Last month, Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha ordered a clampdown on drugs after a former police officer who had been dismissed from the force for methamphetamine possession killed 37 people during a shooting at a nursery.

Videos shared on social media showed demonstrators throwing projectiles, charging at police and trying to overturn a police car; while police advanced on them with shields and beat them back with batons.A youth activist who was at the demonstration told Reuters news agency that people were also protesting against Thailand's Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha.Mr Prayuth first seized power in the 2014 military coup and then retained office in 2019 under a heavily restricted election. He has survived multiple no-confidence votes against him this year."

89,I dream of watching Manchester United but know I never will,"Phra Prasert Panyawaro has dreamed of watching Manchester United at Old Trafford ever since he saw them playing on TV as a boy.He only watched 30 minutes of a match while he was visiting a friend's house, but it was enough to have him hooked.Shortly afterwards, at the age of 12, he moved into a monastery in Thailand to start living as a Theravada Buddhist monk.It was to be the start of a disciplined way of life where he must follow 227 rules - also called precepts.He does not celebrate his birthday. He cannot watch TV, go to the cinema, ride a bike, run, drive a car, eat food after noon - or visit a football stadium.Now aged 37 and living as the head monk in an Edinburgh Buddhist temple, he has spoken to BBC Scotland in a rare interview about his life.""When I was a child I saw Manchester United playing on a TV and I still remember the goalkeeper, Peter Schmeichel,"" he says.""I dream of going to Old Trafford to watch them play, but I know I never will because we are not allowed to go there as monks.""As human beings we have the same feelings as everyone else, but we know how to control ourselves and our minds.""His strict way of living means he has rarely seen his parents or siblings since he was a young boy.Phra Prasert is the middle child of seven siblings.He was brought up on his parents' rice and buffalo farm in Sri Sa Kat Province in Thailand.When his older siblings left home, he worked around the farm and helped take care of his younger brothers and sisters.""I felt I should be playing football with friends and other things like that, but because I was the eldest of the remaining children I had to do many things such as cooking and cleaning,"" he recalls.At the age of 11 he told his parents he wanted to join a monastery and train as a monk to make them proud.When he was 12, he was sent away to study in another province hundreds of miles away from home.""I didn't speak to or see my family for three years. I didn't know the way back to the farm,"" he said.""In my room I thought I am not going to cry and wrote on a piece of paper 'I can do it', which I pinned to my wall and read every day.""I wanted my parents to be proud of me.""He started his training while still living with his parents a year before he moved into the monastery.His Buddhist master told him then that one of the rules he would have to follow was that he was not allowed to touch women.As a result, he and his mother, Muang Prommala, kept a respectful distance between them at their home.But it was not until many years later that he realised that this rule did not completely apply to his mother.""I realised I had misunderstood and that as Buddhist monks we can touch our mums in certain circumstances.""When she is ill or in a dangerous situation I am allowed to touch her so I can help her.""But 25 years later he still has not touched, embraced or even brushed past his mother.Phra Prasert is now the head monk of the Dhammapadipa Temple in the Slateford area of Edinburgh.He walks at the nearby Water of Leith and spends time being mindful, touching tree bark and leaves.""Nature helps with my strength of mind.""We are from nature so it is good to go back to nature,"" he says.But despite living such a disciplined life, he says he is happy and enjoys serving his local community in Scotland.Phra Prasert was invited to live in Scotland by the head monk at the Slateford temple after hearing he had a very good reputation.Phra Prasert agreed to come for two years on a trial. He then decided to stay on in Scotland - becoming head monk when the previous one was promoted to a temple in Leeds.He has lived in Edinburgh for the last seven years. He sleeps on the floor with no bed or mat and is not allowed to watch television.But he has found a modern way to feel close to his frail mother - by having CCTV cameras fitted throughout her farmhouse in Thailand. His father, Chey Prommala, died 10 years ago from diabetes.""I don't feel homesick because I'm used to it and technology really helps,"" added Phra Prasert.""I speak to my mum every day now and can see her from a mobile phone which is linked up to cameras in her house.""She is unwell so it makes me feel better that I can keep an eye on her when I live so far away."""
90,Thai transgender tycoon buys Miss Universe contest,"A Thai celebrity media tycoon - who is a transgender woman - has bought the company that runs the Miss Universe beauty pageants for $20m (£17.1m).Anne Jakapong Jakrajutatip is the boss of JKN Global Group, which makes television shows in Thailand.She has starred in the Thai versions of popular reality shows Project Runway and Shark Tank.Her purchase of the company, which was once co-owned by Donald Trump, comes as the pageant becomes more inclusive.Women wear less make-up since the pandemic'I have a friend now in 80 different countries'Ms Jakrajutatip has been outspoken about her experiences as a transgender woman.She said in a statement that the Miss Universe Organization was a ""strong, strategic addition"" to her company's portfolio.""We seek not only to continue its legacy of providing a platform to passionate individuals from diverse backgrounds, cultures, and traditions, but also to evolve the brand for the next generation,"" she added.""Our relationships with global partners and brands have never been stronger, and our progressive approach continues to position us at the forefront of our industry,"" Miss Universe Organization chief executive Amy Emmerich and president Paula Shugart said.The Miss Universe Organization was co-owned by Mr Trump from 1996 to 2015.The former US president sold the company after two television partners said they would not broadcast the pageant, over comments Mr Trump made about illegal immigrants on his 2016 presidential campaign.He was also criticised when former Miss Universe Alicia Machado claimed Mr Trump called her ""Miss Piggy"".The remarks were made when she put on weight after winning contest in 1996, the Venezuela-born model said.""When I purchased the pageants many years ago, they were in serious trouble,"" Mr Trump said in a statement following the company's sale to US talent agency WME-IMG in 2015.""It has been a great honour making them so successful. The pageants are now in the hands of a great company that will shepherd them to even greater levels of success.""Ms Jakrajutatip's purchase came as the Miss Universe pageant has moved towards being more inclusive.From next year, organisers have said that married women and mothers will be allowed to compete for the title.The competition was previously only open to women who had never been married, and had no children.The pageant has been held annually for 71 years and is broadcast in more than 160 countries."

But who in this amorous scrum will emerge lucky and get to mate with her?This remarkable picture, captured by Karine Aigner, is the grand title winner in this year's Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition.On one level it's quite a technical image. It required the use of a macro probe lens to get in close to the very heart of the action.""I had to spend quite a bit of time on my belly in the dirt,"" Karine joked.The American is only the fifth woman to win the top prize in the 58-year history of WPY, as the competition is often called.""It wasn't something I went looking for. I've been working on a ranch in South Texas for years, and I just happened on the location. I saw all these little 'volcanoes' in the ground - the individual burrows dug by the females to make their nests,"" she told BBC News.Cactus bees, as their name suggests, live on and around cactus plants. The females collect pollen, which they fashion into small balls and store in chambers in the soil. The balls will sustain their larvae until they can surface as adults and continue the reproductive cycle.""The picture is fabulous; it's got so much energy. It's a proper 'behaviour' shot. That's what you get from invertebrates and that's why I love them,"" said Roz Kidman Cox, who chairs the WPY judges. ""It's also the composition.

You can see a sardine flying through the air as it tries to escape being gobbled down by the great cetacean. ""Somehow the sardine jumped in the boat,"" Katanyou recalled. ""I was lucky. I got close in the boat and the whale stayed above the water for about a minute.""WPY is one of the most prestigious competitions of its type in world photography.Started in 1964 by BBC Wildlife Magazine, the competition is now organised by London's Natural History Museum.This year's event drew 38,575 entries from 93 countries. Below are some of the category winners.Brent Stirton is well known for his photojournalism, for which he is the WPY category winner this year. His picture shows the end of life of Ndakasi, a mountain gorilla who was rescued as a two-month-old after her troop was brutally killed by a powerful charcoal mafia in the DRC's Virunga National Park. Ndakasi is in the arms of her rescuer and caregiver, Andre Bauma.These flamingos are pictured high in the Andes at Salar de Uyuni, the world's largest salt pan. It is also one of Bolivia's largest lithium mines, which threatens the future of the flamingos. Japanese photographer Junji Takasago suffered altitude sickness to get this image, but his discomfort won him the Natural Artistry category.It may look colourful but this is not a healthy scene. Daniel Núñez used a drone to capture the contrast between the forest and the algal growth on the edge of Guatemala's Lake Amatitlán. The cyanobacteria in the water are driven by the presence of pollutants, such as sewage discharged from Guatemala City. The image won the Wetlands, The Bigger Picture category.Tony Wu caught this scene off the coast of Japan. It shows a giant sea star (starfish) at the moment of spawning. The echinoderm is moving its arms and swaying its body, perhaps to sweep eggs and sperm into the currents where they can fertilise together in the water. The image won WPY's Underwater category. Fernando Constantino Martínez Belmar took this picture at a location known as the Cave of the Hanging Snakes. At dusk, thousands of bats leave the cave to forage for insects. As they depart, the rat snakes hang from the walls of the cave, aiming to get a meal of their own. The picture won the Behaviour: Amphibians and Reptiles category.Dimitry Kokh took this picture on Kolyuchin Island, which is in the Arctic's Chukchi Sea. The polar bears present a haunting scene in the fog that hangs over the abandoned buildings. Yachtsman Dimitry was on the island to take shelter from a storm. He used a small drone to get close to the predators. The picture won the Urban Wildlife category.  The annual exhibition dedicated to the WPY competition opens at the Natural History Museum in London on Friday. As in past years, it will also go on tour around the UK and to 10 countries worldwide. Entries for the 59th Wildlife Photographer of the Year will be accepted from Monday."
92,Thailand nursery attack: Final farewell after massacre,"Three-year-old Krissakorn Reungcharoen - who goes by the nickname Mick - has opened his eyes just as his hometown of Uthai Sawan prepares to say farewell to the victims of Thailand's worst mass killing.Doctors were concerned he would not survive. He had a severe head injury after being slashed by a large knife during an attack that killed 36 people in Nong Bua Lamphu in northern Thailand. A former police officer Panya Kamrab rampaged through the town armed with a gun and a knife last Thursday. He stormed a childcare centre, killing 23 children, before driving through the streets to kill others. Near his home, he rammed into Mick, his mother and his grandmother who were all on a tricycle. Then he got out of the car and stabbed them.In videos shown by Mick's grandfather days later, the boy is covered in bandages and hooked up to several machines in the intensive care unit in Udon Thani, a neighbouring town.But Mick is alive. He has said his first few words since the attack. He asked for his mother. But 31-year-old Vanida Ruengcharoen did not make it to the hospital. Her portrait now sits atop a coffin at a crowded temple surrounded by her favourite things.There are so many coffins that they take up every bit of space in three of the town's temples.Relatives dressed in black sit in rows of chairs at the front, clutching gilded copies of their lost loved one's portrait. There's a picture of three-year-old Model, a tomboy who was told to wear a skirt to her graduation day which led to frowns in all her photos; of Pattarawut, also three years old, who loved dinosaurs; and of two-year-old Captain whose favourite animal was snails.Twenty-three toddlers were murdered at the childcare centre. One survived.This is the last day of four-day long funeral rites - and nearly every household in this town of around 6,000 people will take time to kneel in front of each of these portraits and say goodbye. Rattan Malapim has been at the temple since sunrise. She rearranges a toy truck and football in front of a portrait of her four year-old son Thanakorn. She has brought him a treat of donuts for his afternoon snack. She still talks to him: ""Did you sleep? Did you manage to eat?""It's a heart-breaking scene but the act of giving offers her some solace. Thai nursery attack: What we knowThe story of the three-year-old survivor‘I am full of pain’: Thailand mourns mass killingsThailand is a majority Buddhist country and keeping the spirits happy is important for relatives. Offering food and doing good deeds is also essential for the dead to live well in the afterlife.You do not grieve alone here, nor is it quiet. Loudspeakers blast the names of those who lost their lives while women sit preparing food for the hundreds who will come to say farewell. Outside, traffic police with whistles keep the streets clear for the crowds in black filing to each of the temples to say their final farewells.Everyone is just trying to find ways to help and to cope. As one official put it, this community is trying to be strong, just as their hearts are at their weakest.Mick's grandfather has been visiting the temple to say goodbye to his daughter, and to tell her that her son is alive.""The bond between them was enormous,"" says 58-year-old Puan Chaikern. ""When I saw them together, it made me happy to see the love they had for one another. I am so shocked at this loss. I still can't process what happened.""His wife is also in hospital and said to be recovering slowly. His neighbour says she is looking out for him and making sure that he is eating - gestures that seem to be typical of this neighbourhood.As Puan heads back to the shrine to see his daughter, he has one other person to thank - a neighbour who may have saved Mick's life. When Mick, his mother and his grandmother were stabbed, Varanchai Prapaspong, ran at the attacker with a stick to try to stop him. He was shot and killed. ""My brother was shouting at the attacker: stop, enough, stop hurting them,"" his sister, Thiwaporn Jandabhut, told us.""Neighbours said that if my brother hadn't distracted the attacker, many more people may have been lost. People keep coming to pay tribute to my brother and say thank you to him.""How will Uthai Sawan move on? One local official, who witnessed the attack and did not want to be named, said she can't sleep with all the brutal images etched in her head.What can help the families who've lost so much, she asked? She worries nothing will ever be normal again.But for now, this funeral offers at least one way to help as the community finds comfort in familiar rituals.""Tell the spirits of the children not to worry,"" she said. ""May their souls go to heaven in peace."""
93,Thai nursery: CNN journalists apologise for entering site of deadly attack,"Two journalists from US news outlet CNN have apologised for their coverage of last week's attack on a childcare centre in Thailand that left 37 people, including 23 children, dead. They entered the building where the attack occurred and filmed on site. They were accused of trespassing and filming a crime scene without permission. Both of them were later cleared of the charges, but fined for working as journalists while on tourist visas.The journalists - reporter Anna Coren and cameraman Daniel Hodge - have agreed to leave the country. They have also apologised in a video that has since been widely circulated by local news outlets, and appeared to have been filmed inside a police station. ""My deepest apologies... especially the families of victims of this tragedy - we are so sorry to have caused you more pain and suffering,"" said Ms Coren, who along with Mr Hodge was fined 5,000 baht ($133; £120).""We know your country is going through a painful time and we never came here to cause more grief.""Thai police investigated the incident after other journalists raised concerns. The Foreign Correspondents' Club of Thailand and Thai Journalists' Association issued statements criticising the CNN crew for "" a serious breach of journalistic ethics in crime reporting"". ""Would one of their crews have behaved in the same way at a serious crime scene in the United States?"" the statement asked.There was also a widely shared picture on social media from the weekend that showed a CNN crew member climbing over a low fence to leave the compound. ‘I am full of pain’: Thailand mourns mass killingsTwenty-four children died, one lived: 'She had no idea'Ms Coren and Mr Hodge were later taken to the police station in Nong Bua Lam Phu province, where the attack took place, for questioning.Two Thai ministers have said the CNN crew did not have official permission to enter the premises, but the police accepted that they believed they had permission and decided not to prosecute them.CNN has issued two statements. In the first response, it said their crew were told by three public health officials that they could film inside. They said the premises had been cordoned off while they were inside, and they needed to climb over the fence to leave. Police later found that village health volunteers had granted the team entry despite having no authority to do so, according to local news outlet The Nation. In the second statement, CNN International's executive vice-president and general manager Mike McCarthy said the team entered the building ""in good faith, to gain a fuller impression of what transpired inside and to humanise the scale of the tragedy for their audience"".He added they ""deeply regret any distress or offense"" the report may have caused, and said CNN had since stopped broadcasting the report and removed the video from its website. Thailand is still in shock over the attack by a former policeman who stormed the childcare centre, killing children as young as two while they slept.Police say the 34-year-old attacker - a local named Panya Kamrab - killed his wife and his step-son, before killing himself after a manhunt. The motive for the attack is not yet known."
94,Thai nursery attack: The story of the three-year-old survivor,"Three-year-old Emmy was napping next to her best friend at a day-care centre in northern Thailand when the attacker broke in, armed with a gun and a knife. The class of 11 children, all around three years old, had earlier been busy drawing and writing. At around 10:00 local time, teachers sent photo updates to all the parents of smiling, happy children.Two hours later, at nap time, former police officer Panya Kamrab stormed the building. Witnesses said he first shot staff, including a teacher who was eight months pregnant, before forcing his way into each of the three kindergarten classrooms.He murdered all of Emmy's friends as they slept.It is unclear how she survived. She was found awake, curled up next to the bodies of her classmates.""She had no idea what was happening when she woke up,"" her 59-year-old grandfather Somsak Srithong tells me from the family home.""She thought that her friends were still asleep. A police officer covered her face with a cloth and carried her away from all the blood.""Rescuers took Emmy to the second floor to shield her from the horror. They then combed the other two classes, desperately hoping to find others alive.She is the only child to live through the massacre in Nong Bua Lamphu on Thursday. In total 37 people died - including the wife and stepson of the attacker - and 24 of the dead are children.""I feel very grateful that she survived. I held her so tight when I first saw her,"" says Somsak.Emmy's mother, 35-year-old Panompai Srithong, works in Bangkok during the week. She had been told that all of the children at the centre had died, and needed to be convinced her daughter was still alive.""I finally got a video call with Emmy and was filled with blessed relief,"" she says.Thai nursery attack: What we know‘I am full of pain’: Thailand mourns mass killingsThis small town is filled with grieving families, and for the first few days, Emmy's grandparents struggled to know what to tell her.We talk quietly as she plays with her favourite Hello Kitty wellington boots in the garden. She keeps asking after her best friend, three-year-old Pattarawut, who was also known as Taching. They always napped together with their feet touching.

95,'Raw grief' at temple after Thailand nursery attack,"The BBC's Jonathan Head says there are distressing scenes as families arrive at a temple to collect victims of a nursery attack in north-east Thailand.An ex-policeman killed 37 people, 23 of them children as young as two, at a childcare centre.Police say the 34-year-old attacker - a local named Panya Kamrab - then killed his wife and his step-son, before killing himself after a manhunt."
96,Thailand childcare centre attack: What we know,"A former police officer wielding a shotgun, a pistol and a knife has gone on the rampage at a childcare centre in Thailand.The vicious attack - in Nong Bua Lamphu province - has shocked the country and many are asking: why?The attacker stormed the centre in the town of Uthai Sawan, 500km (310 miles) north-east of Bangkok, at about 12:30 local time (05:30 GMT) on Thursday.One of the teachers at the centre told local media they thought the man wanted something - after all, they knew him because his son attended the same centre, even though he had not been there for a month.Carers tried to lock the doors, but the man proceeded to attack indiscriminately.""The shooter came in around lunchtime and shot four or five officials at the childcare centre first,"" district official Jidapa Boonsom told Reuters news agency. ""At first, people thought it was fireworks,"" she said. The attacker, she added, then forced his way into a locked room where children were sleeping, stabbing them. Only one is said to have survived.A teacher who managed to escape described the knife ""like one for cutting grass - it was curved"".From there, the man fled as police were alerted and launched a manhunt.AFP news agency quotes an eyewitness who was riding a motorcycle to her shop when she saw him driving away erratically.""The attacker rammed a motorbike and two people were injured. I sped off to get away from him,""  Paweena Purichan said, adding, ""There was blood everywhere."" He fled the scene in a white four-door Toyota pick-up truck with Bangkok registration plates and went home, where he killed himself, his wife and their son, police said. The number of fatalities is at least 38, including 23 children. Some of the children were as young as two. A number of them were care centre staff, including some killed as they were having lunch outside the nursery and others who tried to lock the man out.Other adults - and at least one of the children - were killed as the attacker fled from the scene.At least 12 people have been wounded.He has been named as Panya Khamrab, 34. His motive remains unclear. The 9mm pistol he had used had been obtained legally, police said. But he had mostly used his knife to kill the children, they added.The police sergeant was suspended from the force over drug use in January and dismissed in June, National Police Chief Damrongsak Kittiprapat told reporters.Khamrab had attended a court hearing on a charge of use and possible trade in methamphetamine early on Thursday before carrying out the attack.  The verdict was scheduled to be delivered on Friday.Damrongsak said the attacker had been in a manic state, but it was unknown whether it was drug-related.""We have to test his blood for drugs,"" he said.Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha described the shooting as ""a shocking event"".Mass shootings in the country are rare, although gun ownership rates are relatively high, and illegal weapons are also common, according to the Reuters news agency. The nursery attack comes less than a month after an army officer shot dead two of his colleagues at a base in Bangkok.In 2020, a soldier killed 29 people and injured dozens more in the city of Nakhon Ratchasima."
97,Thailand attack: ‘I am full of pain and anger',"Duangphan Patphaothanun is wandering outside a childcare centre, clutching a bag full of toys. The 64-year-old grandmother wants to know when she can see her grandson, so she can place his most treasured possessions with him in his coffin - the bag includes a large plastic dinosaur. Three-year-old Pattarawut is among the 23 children who died on Thursday in a gun and knife attack at a childcare centre in Thailand's north-east. A former policeman had stormed the building, killing children as young as two while they slept, leaving at least 37 people dead. More than 90 children usually attend the centre but because of poor weather and a bus breakdown only 24 of them were there on Thursday. Only one child has survived.Police say the 34-year-old attacker - a local named Panya Kamrab - killed his wife and his step-son, before killing himself after a manhunt. His step-son used to attend the centre but hadn't been for the past month. The motive for the attack is not yet known. But police said Kamrab was fired from his job in June for drug use. ""When I heard the news about the shooting, I just fainted,"" Duangphan said. On her phone are photos of Pattarawut, taken just hours before the shooting. Like many childcare centres, this one too regularly posts photo updates for parents to see - the images show happy, smiling faces, writing or finishing a drawing. Duangphan was one of several grieving relatives who had gathered outside the centre in Nong Bua Lamphua province on Friday morning. Another grandmother, 46-year-old Nipha Lawongsechaison, says she lost both a grandson and granddaughter in the attack.""I am full of such pain... [and] anger because I cannot do anything,"" she says. She's not the only one. Others too say they are filled with grief - and unanswered questions. ""Why did he take it [out] on the children? Why kill them when they did nothing to him?"" says 27-year-old Naliwan Dungkhet, whose two-year-old nephew Captain also died in the attack. He was just a month away from his third birthday. 'It's shocking' - witnesses describe nursery attack horrorThai pre-school attack: What we knowAmong the mourners was Komsan Norraburh. His ex-wife married the attacker who killed both her and Norraburh's three-year-old son, Worraphat.""I was at the factory [when] my friend asked me to check the news. I called my ex-wife and son to see if they were ok but no-one answered,"" he said. ""He was a good boy who liked to talk a lot. I'm waiting to pick up his body and see his face one last time.""Many of the relatives said they had waited outside the childcare centre well into the night on Thursday, while others gathered at the police station.They would eventually be greeted by the sight of pink and white coffins adorned with gold, bearing the bodies of the children, which were brought to a hospital morgue in Udon Thani and laid out in rows. Police said the armed attacker broke into the building just after lunch time on Thursday, shooting his way past a teacher and parent outside. He was recognised by one of the teachers when he burst in.Witnesses said he first shot staff - including a teacher who was eight months pregnant- before forcing his way past teachers into a room where children were napping. He then stabbed most of his victims before fleeing.Officers who rushed to the nursery were confronted with the bodies of adults and children, lying inside and outside the building. Kamrab had appeared in court the morning of the attack on charges related to the use and possible sale of methamphetamine. He had been due to face a verdict on Friday.Mass shootings in Thailand are rare, although gun ownership rates are relatively high for the region. In 2020 a soldier killed 29 people and injured dozens more in the city of Nakhon Ratchasima. Thursday's attack comes less than a month after an army officer shot dead two of his colleagues at a base in Bangkok.Additional reporting by Suchada Phoisaat"
98,Thailand nursery attack: Witnesses describe shocking attack,"People who witnessed a deadly rampage at a Thai nursery have described the horrific moment a former police officer burst in and began attacking staff and children.Nanticha Panchum, the headteacher at the childcare centre, said that after sending the children off for a nap, she had been about to make some lunch when she heard five gunshots.She told the BBC there would normally be 92 children at the centre, but because of the shared bus breaking down and some rain, there were only 24 on site at the time of the attack.Only one child survived, according to Ms Nanticha.""This is something I never dreamed of… I don't know what to do next. I really can't think of anything at the moment,"" she said.One of the other teachers recognised the attacker as a parent of a child at the centre, she said - although that child had not attended school for a month.She said the man never came across as unwell, adding he was always polite when dropping his son off and was almost too chatty sometimes.But on Thursday, she said the colleague told her his eyes were crossed and he was quiet. The teachers were trying to lock the door, but he broke in and went into the rooms where the children were sleeping, she said.Ms Nanticha told AFP some staff members had been eating outside when the attacker parked his car and shot four of them dead.He then ""smashed down the door with his leg and then came inside"" and began attacking the children, she said.One distraught teacher at the nursery told how she locked the door and tried to get help before the killer, armed with a gun and knife, shot his way in and attacked sleeping children.She trembled as she told Thailand's Thairath TV how she heard a sound ""similar to firecrackers"" and saw two colleagues lying on the floor before seeing the attacker walking towards her.She said she told other colleagues to get into a room and had locked the door before climbing out over a wall to get help. The teacher cried as she said she was not in time.Children as young as two were among the victims of the attack at the centre in the Nong Bua Lamphu province.There were fewer than usual children at the centre when the man arrived as heavy rain had kept many people away, according to district official Jidapa Boonsom, who was working in an office nearby.""The shooter came in around lunchtime and shot four or five officials at the childcare centre first,"" Ms Jidapa told Reuters news agency.The attacker then forced his way into a locked room where children were sleeping and attacked them, the official said.At first people thought the shots were fireworks, she said.""It's really shocking. We were very scared and running to hide once we knew it was shooting. So many children got killed, I've never seen anything like it.""A teacher who managed to escape described the knife as ""like one for cutting grass - it was curved"".Paweena Purichan, 31, told AFP news agency she was riding her motorcycle to the shop when she encountered the killer trying to ram other drivers as he fled the scene in a truck.""He intended to crash into others on the road,"" she said. ""The attacker rammed a motorbike and two people were injured. I sped off to get away from him.""There was blood everywhere,"" she said. Police named the attacker as Panya Kamrab, a police lieutenant colonel who had been dismissed from the force for drug use. They said he had been described as agitated before the attack and had opened fire after being unable to find his child at the centre, according to broadcaster ThaiPBS."
99,Thailand: Many children among dead in nursery attack,"An ex-policeman has killed at least 37 people, most of them children, in a gun and knife attack at a childcare centre in north-east Thailand.Police say he then killed himself and his family after a manhunt following the attack in Nong Bua Lamphu province.Children and adults are among the casualties at the nursery - police say the attacker mostly stabbed his victims before fleeing the scene. The former officer, aged 34, was sacked in June for drug use, police said.It is not clear if there was a motive for the attack. At least 23 children were among the dead in the mass killing in the town of Utthai Sawan. Some victims aged as young as two were attacked as they slept. A dozen people who were injured have been taken to Nong Bua Lamphu district hospital.Headteacher Nanticha Panchum said the attacker's son attended the centre but had not been there for a month. The man used to drop his child off, and was always polite and chatty, she said. Ms Panchum said there were usually more than 90 children at the school, but just over 20 were present on Thursday due to bad weather and a school bus breakdown. ""The shooter came in around lunchtime and shot four or five officials at the childcare centre first,"" a local official, Jidapa Boonsom, who was working nearby, told Reuters news agency.

""After inspecting the crime scene, we found that the perpetrator tried to break in and he mainly used a knife to commit the crime by killing a number of small children,"" said Police Chief Damrongsak Kittiprapat.""Then he got out and started killing anyone he met along the way with a gun or the knife until he got home. We surrounded the house and then found that he committed suicide in his home.""Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha described the incident as ""a shocking event"".Police named the attacker as Panya Kamrab, a local man who had been a police sergeant before he was suspended for drug use in January, and then dismissed in June. He is understood to have appeared in court on Thursday on charges related to the use and possible sale of methamphetamine. The verdict was scheduled to be delivered on Friday.Armed with a shotgun, a pistol and a knife, he stormed the nursery at about 12:30 local time (05:30 GMT). The details of what followed are still emerging, but after the killing spree the attacker fled the scene in a white four-door Toyota pick-up truck with Bangkok registration plates, according to police, who launched a search for him and warned locals to keep indoors for their own safety. Eyewitnesses were quoted saying the attacker had driven into bystanders and opened fire at some of them, injuring several people as he made his escape.Police say Kamrab returned home, killing his wife and son before taking his own life.Mass shootings in Thailand are rare, although gun ownership rates are relatively high for the region. Illegal weapons are also common in the south-east Asian country, according to the Reuters news agency.

102,Prayuth Chan-ocha: Thai court rules coup leader can remain PM,"Thailand's Constitutional Court has thrown out a legal challenge to Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha's term limits, ruling he can stay in office. It had suspended him while it heard the case but it had been widely expected to reject the opposition parties' petition.The opposition argued General Prayuth had exceeded his constitutionally-limited eight years in office.The former military chief seized power in a 2014 coup. He made himself PM in August that year, meaning he has been the PM now for longer than that.But the court ruled that his term of office began in April 2017 when the constitution came into effect, and not when he was appointed in 2014. The Constitutional Court has a long history of ruling in favour of conservative, royalist groups and against those associated with reform; in the past 16 years it has sacked three prime ministers and dissolved three political parties, all from one side of Thailand's divided politics. Few believed its judges, some appointed under Gen Prayuth, would be prepared to go as far as sacking him too.The opposition case appeared to be strong. The new constitution, drafted in 2017 under Gen Prayuth's then-military government, stated that ""The Prime Minister shall not hold office for a total period of more than eight years"". However the Constitutional Court argues that this only came into effect with the new constitution in April 2017, and that it is from this date that Gen Prayuth's years in office should be counted.But this is not the verdict Gen Prayuth's supporters had been hoping for. They have been proposing June 2019 as the start date, when he was re-appointed prime minister following the first post-coup parliamentary election earlier that year.This is important because Gen Prayuth has made it clear he would like to contest the next election, expected early in 2023, aiming to become Thailand's longest-serving prime minister - not bad for an army commander who said he was only taking power temporarily. The Constitutional Court ruling means he has just two-and-a-half years left until he hits the term limit, making him less appealing as a prime ministerial candidate to conservative parties.There have been rumours of powerful lobbying behind the scenes to sway the court's decision. The fact that the Constitutional Court suspended Gen Prayuth from his job while they reached their decision - widely seen here as a humiliation - and that he did not get his preferred outcome, suggests there are splits in the broad conservative coalition which chose him as leader in 2019. He is much less popular now, after eight years in which the Thai economy has not performed well, although there is no obvious rival as the figurehead for conservative, royalist values.What all this manoeuvring underlines is how fluid and unsettled Thai politics still is, more than eight years after a coup whose leaders said they were going to sort out the country's political arrangements once and for all. The eight-year term limit was inserted into the constitution to prevent popular politicians from leveraging election victories into a long-term hold on power, as exiled former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra was accused of doing. Yet no-one seems to have anticipated that the limit would come back to haunt the man who supervised the writing of that charter. The political rules in Thailand are still being disputed, and no-one in a country which has experienced at least 20 military coups would bet on there never being another."

105,Thailand lèse-majesté: Activist jailed for dressing like Thai queen at protest,"An activist in Thailand has been jailed for two years after a court found she insulted the monarchy by dressing like the Thai queen.Jatuporn 'New' Saeoueng, 25, wore a pink dress at a political demonstration in Bangkok in 2020.She denied the royal insult charge, saying she had just worn a traditional dress.But Thailand has notoriously strict laws which effectively ban criticism of the king and other royals.Since King Maha Vajiralongkorn ascended the throne in 2019, rights groups say authorities have increasingly exercised lèse-majesté laws to quash a protest movement that had demanded reform of the powerful monarchy.Since November 2020, at least 210 protesters have been charged with lèse-majesté offences, after a three-year period where the law wasn't enforced at all, Thai legal groups say.The students who challenged the Thai kingLese majeste: How Thailand forbids insult of its royaltyHuman rights groups strongly criticised the court's verdict on Monday. Jatupon was sentenced to three years but had her term immediately reduced to two years.She had attended the protest in 2020 as a performer dressed in a formal pink silk dress, where she walked a red carpet accompanied by an attendant who held an umbrella over her head.The king's wife, Queen Suthida, often wears formal silk fashions for public events. Thai royals also often have attendants hovering over them with parasols at ceremonies and other events.Jatuporn said in an interview published before the court ruling: ""I have no intention to mock anyone. I dressed for myself on that day, for a version of myself in a Thai tradition dress,"" the Associated Press reported.The red carpet protest - one of several that year critical of the monarchy and its influence over the military government - had been staged the same week as a fashion show being held by one of King Vajiralongkorn's daughters.""The mock fashion show was a satirical take on the political situation of the country - a peaceful public event akin to a street festival,"" said an Amnesty International spokesman.""Participants should not be punished for participating in a peaceful assembly.""Last year, a former civil servant who was deemed to have been critical of the royals on social media was sentenced to 43 years in jail.The palace has not commented on either of these lèse-majesté cases. The protest movement had initially targeted the military-backed government, led by the ex-junta leader who seized power from a democratically-elected civilian government in a coup in 2014.However its criticisms then expanded to include the new king and royal family. The movement shattered a taboo on criticising the monarchy, though protest leaders were careful to call for changes to the institution, not its abolition.Thai court suspends PM and coup leader PrayuthMonarchy reform calls unconstitutional: Thai courtProtesters wanted greater scrutiny after King Vajiralongkorn took direct control of the Crown's immense wealth and leadership of two army divisions.His famously lavish lifestyle also rankled with ordinary Thais struggling amid the pandemic."
106,Prayuth Chan-ocha: Thai court suspends PM and coup leader,"Thailand's top court has suspended prime minister Prayuth Chan-ocha from official duty while it considers a legal challenge to his term limit. Opposition parties have filed a case arguing that Mr Prayuth - in charge since 2014 - has overstayed his tenure. Thailand's constitution limits prime ministers to eight years in office.The ex-army chief first seized power in the 2014 military coup and then retained office in 2019 under a heavily restricted election.However, in recent years he has been facing growing opposition, and backlash within his own coalition. So far this year, he has survived multiple no-confidence votes against him.Opponents and activists have argued Mr Prayuth's term began when he was junta leader. As military leader, he seized power in the May 2014 coup and then appointed himself prime minister of the new military government in August 2014. That means his term should end this week, his critics say.However his supporters say his term only began in 2017 - when a new constitution came into force - or even after a general election in 2019 that saw him retain power.Under those terms, he could technically continue serving until 2027 - if he wins an upcoming general election. On Wednesday, Thailand's Constitutional Court agreed to hear the case from the political opposition. The bench of judges ruled five to four in support of his immediate suspension.It's unclear when the court will deliver its ruling on Mr Prayath's case.Protesters had earlier gathered outside parliament buildings in the capital, Bangkok, demanding his resignation.The move means Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan, 77, will become the interim prime minister, according to the cabinet line of succession.Thailand is due to hold a vote before May next year, although the deputy PM had previously flagged it could be as early as November.The constitutional court is a much-criticised body in Thailand, accused of ruling consistently against opposition parties and in favour of the military-dominated government of Prayuth Chan-ocha. So there is some surprise that the judges have now decided to suspend him from his job while they consider what to do. Whether they now go further and rule that he must give up the post completely depends on when they view his term as starting - eight years ago, when he was formally appointed prime minister following his coup, five years ago when the new charter was enacted, or even three years ago, after the first post-coup election saw him reinstated. The legal arguments for each of these is finely balanced, which raises the possibility that political considerations will decide the matter.Most Thais expect the court to leave him in his job, and avoid shaking up Thai politics only months before the next election is due to be held. But General Prayuth has lost a lot of popularity, due to his irascible leadership style and ineffective stewardship of the Thai economy. He has faced serious challenges from factions inside his own party. Never a natural campaigner, he may no longer be seen as an asset when the election is called. As always in Thailand, there is also speculation about what the palace wants. King Vajiralongkorn is officially above politics, but many Thais believe his preferences also influence these big decisions."
107,We built a Buddhist temple in an Edinburgh family home,"When plans for a huge Buddhist temple on the outskirts of Edinburgh had to be shelved, monks based in what was once a family home in the city decided to transform it instead.A renovation project at The Dhammapadipa Temple in Slateford saw a double garage converted into a prayer room complete with an 80 stone (500kg) gold-plated Buddha from Thailand.Now the three resident Theravada Buddhist monks are urging people to visit the temple to see the transformation.Members of the Thai community that settled in Scotland first established The Dhammapadipa Temple in 2005.Thai billionaire and former Leicester City chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha had been behind a plan to relocate the temple to a bigger site in an A-listed property in another area of the city. However, after his tragic death in a helicopter crash at the football club's stadium in 2018 things changed.Kachen Gerdphol, chairman of temple, told BBC Scotland Mr Srivaddhanaprabha had been known for his great generosity to his Buddhist faith.""He had found a big A-listed property in the south-east of Edinburgh and asked us to come and have a look to see if we liked it,"" he said.""It was a very grand building and it was very expensive.""The community decided that instead of moving to another site it would improve the temple's current base in an ordinary suburban home. ""We really need to live within our means and if we had been left maintaining an A-listed building it would have left us very vulnerable,"" added Kachen Gerdphol.""We love our temple in Slateford as it is easy to access for our monks and community.""Head monk Phramaha Prasert Prommala told BBC Scotland they were very proud of the results of the £50,000 renovation, which they completed earlier this year.Inside, the kitchen gives away that it was once a family home, as do the bedrooms until a closer look reveals there are no beds.""Monks don't sleep on beds, we sleep on the floor,"" said Phramaha Prasert.""We also don't watch television and any smart phones you see or technical equipment is used purely for giving talks.""Downstairs, the space where a double garage used to be is now a huge prayer room.The garage doors have been replaced with large soundproof windows.The centrepiece on an altar is the 500kg gold-plated Buddha, which was shipped from Thailand and lifted into place using an ancient Egyptian-style lever and pole system.Phramaha Prasert said: ""This was a massive logistical exercise. Knocking the wall down between the double garage was meant to take half a day for a couple of men but it ended up taking a team of six three-and-a-half weeks.""There were steel bars through poured concrete and the construction workers asked if it had previously been a bank vault or a military room for explosives.""We said no, it was just a family home when we bought it.""Running along the edge, where the ceiling meets the walls is block cornicing, which Phramaha Prasert said was so that the temple remained ""sympathetic to its Edinburgh location"".But there is also traditional temple decor inside that was shipped from Thailand, such as a hand-carved door from Lampang.It was cut into eight pieces so it could be transported more easily before being stuck back together by Edinburgh joiners.Phramaha Prasert said: ""Everyone is very generous in Thailand so this Buddha was donated to us.""There were some nervous moments levering the Buddha into the prayer room while trying not to damage the ceiling.""An extension has also been added to make a second smaller prayer room with a £20,000 Buddha which was donated after being used in a Thai garden at the Chelsea Flower Show.The site was authorised to operate as a temple by the Thai Sangha Council, which is headed up by the Supreme Patriarch (head figure of Buddhism in Thailand).It was also blessed in a ""new dawn"" ceremony to complete its transformation into a temple.The city council approved an application for a change of use in order for the building to be recognised as a ""place of worship"".Head monk Phramaha Prasert Prommala said: ""We have an open door policy to all, regardless of religious beliefs or age, and we want to invite anyone interested to come now and visit us."""
108,Thailand toad: Amphibian's lift in Cardiff student's suitcase,"A university student returned from Thailand to Wales with an unexpected guest in her suitcase - a toad. Hannah Turian thinks the amphibian travelled more than 5,000 miles to Cardiff after hopping in a shoe. It's now being cared for by a reptile expert after an estimated 35 hours as a toad on the road - and in the air - but seems healthy despite the experience.Hannah, 20, said: ""After the toad had gone, we just sat in our lounge and were like, what has just happened?""Exotic frog found among supermarket bananasFrog from Ecuador found in Tesco bananasThe Cardiff University student was in Thailand visiting her aunt, after teaching English there for a month. She flew into Heathrow Airport, got back to her student house in Cardiff on Saturday night, and unpacked her suitcase the next morning.""When I first saw the toad moving I was on the phone to my mum, I just closed the suitcase, and ran out. ""Me and my housemate then carried it upstairs into the bathroom. We unzipped the suitcase, and there's a toad sitting in the corner of it looking at us.""""When I arrived my suitcase got scanned before I could leave the airport. So I don't know how it wasn't spotted.""It was swiftly named Robert by Hannah and her friends, but it needed to find a home. Hannah tried the RSPCA website, but, as she pointed out: ""It obviously didn't have information about smuggling a toad from Thailand.""Next she turned to Facebook, and got a message about a rescue centre for reptiles in Cwmbran, Torfaen.Jackie Hamilton, 40, then drove to Cardiff to pick it up.

109,Thailand nightclub fire kills at least 14 and injures dozens,"At least 14 people were killed and around 40 others injured after a fire swept through a nightclub in Chonburi province in south-eastern Thailand. The fire broke out at 01:00 local time on Friday (18:00 GMT Thursday) at the Mountain B nightspot in Sattahip district, police said.Footage shows people screaming as they flee, some with clothes on fire. The cause of the fire is not clear, with rescuers saying flammable material on the walls may have exacerbated it. The venue in Chonburi, a province located 150km (90 miles) south of Bangkok, was a single-storey complex measuring 4,800 square metres (51,660 square feet).Firefighters battled for more than two hours to bring the fire under control, local media reported. The blaze apparently broke out during a live music performance at the venue, according to the mother of one of the music performers who died in the incident.Bodies of the victims were mostly found near the entrance and in the bathrooms. Others were found near the DJ booth. So far, all those who died are believed to be Thai nationals. Officials from the Sawang Rojanathammasathan Rescue Foundation said flammable acoustic foam on the club's walls might have accelerated the speed at which the fire tore through the venue. Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha on Friday ordered an investigation into the fire, and said that families of the victims would receive aid from authorities. He also urged entertainment venues nationwide to ensure they had proper emergency exits and safety measures in place.Officials said the venue had been turned from a restaurant into a nightclub and was likely operating without permission.This is not the first time a deadly fire has broken out in a Thai nightclub. In 2009, more than 60 people died in Bangkok after a fire spread at the Santika Club in the early hours of New Year's Day. Two men, including the owner of the club, were jailed in 2011.And a fire at a nightclub in the popular Thai tourist destination of Phuket in 2012 killed four people and injured about a dozen others."
110,Thai cave rescue: Meeting saved footballers four years later,"Four years ago, 12 Thai junior footballers and their coach were rescued after 18 days trapped in a cave. It was a dramatic rescue that involved sedating the children to get them out - and few thought it would succeed. The BBC's Jonathan Head revisits Titan, one of the boys rescued, and his coach, to find out what has happened since then, and goes back to the caves with one of the rescuers who got them out.

111,Thirteen Lives: Thai cave rescue actor Tom Bateman relives diving fears,"""The cast definitely all felt fear at various times,"" says director Ron Howard, who's revealing how he shot the rescue of a Thai boys' football team from a flooded cave, for his latest film.Thirteen Lives tells the story of the perilous real-life rescue of the boys and their coach, trapped deep inside the Tham Luang cave network after monsoon rains came early in 2018. ""A couple of the actors admitted later they had some trying moments - but nobody had to leave the tank and breathe into a brown paper bag,"" the double Oscar-winner tells the BBC.The film stars Viggo Mortensen, Colin Farrell, Joel Edgerton, Tom Bateman and Paul Gleeson as the divers, who guided the footballers along underwater spaces so narrow they could barely squeeze through. The Thai caves are made of limestone, which accumulates water until it's saturated and then floods - in this case with calamitous results.The actors had to replicate the conditions endured by the real-life divers.Bateman plays Chris Jewell, a British computer software consultant and expert cave diver, who was part of the rescue mission. The two kept in touch on set by text, so the actor could ask him about the role.""Every single day was a challenge for me,"" Bateman says, adding he had scuba dived before, but had never done cave diving.""I didn't quite realise how it made you feel... I suffer greatly from claustrophobia and I did meditate a lot,"" he says, on how he coped.The actor is able to smile about it now, but he describes getting stuck underwater for about seven minutes while guiding a female diver, who played one of the boys, through a narrow passage. The boys were heavily sedated for the rescue. Had they been awake, the likelihood is they would have panicked and injured themselves, and the diver. ""I had this amazing stunt double, she just had to lie there and have an actor take her through,"" Bateman says. ""You think, 'If it's bad for me, imagine being her - she's completely helpless'.Then he got wedged between some rocks. ""I can remember feeling really hot and thinking, 'I'm underwater, but I'm sweating',"" he says, as he watched his pulse racing on a wrist monitor. ""I could just see my heart rate going up and up and up.""But the beautiful gift of it was overcoming that... it's all in your head. It was a really safe environment, so getting over that hurdle of 'I can do this' is a small victory each time you do it."" Howard explains that some of the spaces were so small that despite ""a great caretaking... you couldn't get the safety divers in with them all the time"".Bateman ultimately had to work himself free.When news of the trapped boys broke, it flew around the world, and more than 10,000 volunteers gathered to help. The Thai Government assembled a team of the world's most experienced cave divers, two of whom found the football team alive but very hungry - nine days after they disappeared. Two Thai Navy Seals died - one while delivering air tanks, and another a year later, from an infection contracted during the rescue. Early social media reactions to Thirteen Lives have been broadly positive. The Telegraph's film critic Robbie Collin called the film ""compulsively watchable"" while singer Allman Brown added: ""Everything on screen serves the incredible true story.""However, others say it's ""not quite as suspenseful or exciting"" as some other rescue movies such as Apollo 13 or Everest, and critics' reviews will not be published until later this week. While Howard hasn't tried cave diving himself, Mortensen really took to it. Bateman says his fellow actor ""found it very calming,"" which is similar to how many cave divers say it makes them feel.  Mortensen plays Rick Stanton, a British diver who specialises in cave rescues. Stanton is what you might call a lateral thinker, having created a device called a side mount rebreather, which enabled him to dive to greater depths. He was one of the advisors on the film, ensuring it was as accurate as possible, along with fellow British rescue diver Jason Mallinson.When the boys became trapped, Stanton flew from the UK to help, along with British cave diver John Volanthen, played by Farrell.They were the ones who found the boys alive, and their footage of that moment was shown around the world. Having navigated other global cave rescues, how did this one compare? ""This is way off the scale,"" Stanton tells the BBC. ""In 2004, I rescued six British soldiers trapped in a cave in Mexico. That was a huge international incident - we had to dive them out.""It was just a warm-up act for Thailand. It wasn't wasn't anywhere near the same scale, because Thailand involved boys. The magnitude of difficulty was not on the same same playing field.""Having become a bit disillusioned with cave diving after he retired as a firefighter in 2014, Stanton - by sheer chance - had returned to his sport a month before the rescue.""I don't even believe in this stuff,"" he adds. ""But you would think that my whole life had been preparing for that very event.""Stanton describes Mortensen as ""absolutely a water person"", who went swimming before filming, and had a basic diving qualification. Mortensen used Stanton's book, Aquanaut: A Life Beneath The Surface, as research. Most of the movie was made on a specially built set in Australia, which recreated key parts of the torturous route, 2,950m inside the cave system. Production designer Molly Hughes had slits built into the rock for the cameras, which were later disguised using computer-generated imagery (CGI). ""CGI could not really do much heavy lifting for us,"" Howard recalls. He says the actors insisted on doing all their own diving rather than using stunt doubles, which made filming easier.""But it still ultimately became human beings trapped in a tiny space, trying to navigate in and around stalactites. The whole thing was much slower to shoot than I expected, and much more difficult to execute.""Howard chose this story because, despite it being widely covered, he felt there was so much more to know.""When I read Bill Nicholson's screenplay, it's one of those situations where I thought I knew more or less what had happened. And yet it told me I didn't know the half of it,"" he explains.Howard is full of praise for the Thai Government's ""lack of political interference and willingness to put pride aside, and open the situation up to volunteers"". ""But make no mistake they were leading the entire time,"" he says. The director was also very clear on was the portrayal of the Thai people and their culture in the film.""I didn't want to take any chances,"" he says. ""So there was no version of me accepting that this talented actor from Korea looks right enough that they could play the role. I just nixed that. I was rigid about casting.""The film shows volunteers and experts diverting gallons of rainwater away from the caves onto nearby crops, which local farmers agreed to sacrifice.Howard has made plenty of documentaries, and describes those made on the Thai caves rescue as ""riveting"" but adds: ""The one thing scripted versions of stories can do is engage audience members' nervous systems. The actors, dialogue, camera work and music... open this pathway of empathy.""He wants the film to celebrate both the huge rescue effort and the international co-operation, as well as ""giving audiences something thrilling, emotional and visceral for them to experience"".Thirteen Lives is released in cinemas on Friday 29 July and launches on Prime Video on Friday 5 August."

113,Thai cave rescue divers get honorary degrees in Bristol,"Two British cave divers who rescued 12 boys and their football coach from a flooded cave in Thailand have been given honorary degrees.John Volanthen, from Bristol, and Rick Stanton, from Coventry, were involved in the dramatic events in July 2018.They navigated 1.6 miles (2.5km) of constricted underwater passageways, in near zero visibility, against a fast-flowing current.The honorary degree was presented by the University of Bristol.Mr Volanthen and Mr Stanton were called in by the Thai Government after heavy rain trapped 12 members of a junior football team and their coach in Tham Luang, a cave complex in the north of the country.""It was unprecedented, nothing really compares. People are citing it as one of the greatest rescues of all time,"" said  Mr Stanton.""It was a protracted two-and-a-half weeks and you had to think outside the box. We were literally writing the procedures, there was no manual - this had never been done before.""At the time of the rescue Mr Volanthen was 47 and Mr Stanton was 57.They received their honorary degrees on Wednesday during the University of Bristol's summer graduations.Linda Wilson, Vice-President of the University of Bristol's Spelaeological Society, nominated John and Rick for their honorary degrees.""Rick, John and the other rescue divers were being asked to perform an impossible task,"" said Ms Wilson.""Fortunately, by a combination of extraordinary courage and meticulous planning, they overcame all the odds and succeeded in one of the most extraordinary rescues that has ever been attempted.""Bringing out all 12 boys and their coach alive despite the most hazardous conditions imaginable.""Mr Stanton said it was an ""absolute honour"" to receive the award. ""It's an honour and humbling, especially considering others who have received the same and have achieved far greater things than me,"" said Mr Volanthen.Amongst other achievements, they have both received George Medals, a non-military award for gallantry.""No one could better exemplify the values this University prizes - resilience, courage and outstanding skills - than Rick and John, who were to save the lives of so many others, whist risking their own lives,"" added Ms Wilson.Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

114,Thailand cannabis: From a war on drugs to weed curries,"Thailand legalised cultivating and consuming cannabis this month, reversing a hard-line approach of long prison sentences or even the death penalty for drug offences. The BBC's South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head reports on what's behind the dramatic change. Twenty-one years ago, I had one of the more searing experiences of my journalistic career. We were invited to watch, and film, the execution of five prisoners, four of them convicted drug traffickers, by firing squad in Bangkok's Bangkwan prison. The look on those men's faces, as they were walked, leg-chains clinking, to the pavilion where the executions took place, is something I shall never forget. It was part of then prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra's ""war on drugs"", which later escalated into the killing of many hundreds of drug suspects. Thaksin's campaign was popular. Thais were worried about the damaging effects on their communities of narcotics like methamphetamines - and they were willing to ignore the shocking violations of human rights that came with the violent crackdown. Other countries in the region have followed the same punitive approach, notably the Philippines after President Rodrigo Duterte took office in 2016. Singapore and Malaysia have imposed the death penalty for drug trafficking for decades. Tourists coming to South East Asia have long been warned of the harsh penalties they face if caught with even small amounts of marijuana.It's hard to imagine, then, that what we have seen over the past weeks is actually happening in Thailand.Cafés and stalls have been openly selling all kinds of cannabis products, or showing off jars filled with potent marijuana flowers. The minister for public health, Anutin Charnvirakul - architect of the new law, which now gives Thailand perhaps the most liberal marijuana regime anywhere in the world - was seen sampling weed-laced curries, and being applauded by farmers who hope it will bring them new sources of income. There were gaggles of giggling Thai grannies trying lurid-green cannabis drinks, and lining up to collect one of the million free marijuana plants the government is handing out. The new law appears to give Thailand what is perhaps the most liberal approach to marijuana anywhere in the world. For the moment, people can grow and consume as much of the plant as they like, though there are a few limits on how they can market and sell it.""One thing is clear. You cannot go to jail in Thailand just for using cannabis any more,"" says Tom Kruesopon, a pioneering entrepreneur who helped persuade the government to change its approach. ""You can go to jail for doing other things, like smoking in public, as a public nuisance, or creating and selling a product from cannabis that you did not get approval for from the Food and Drug Administration. But Thailand is the first country in the world where you cannot go to jail for growing or using the plant.""""This is like a dream for us. We never thought we would go this far in Thailand,"" says Rattapon Sanrak, who began campaigning for legalisation of marijuana after experiencing its medical benefits while studying in the United States. Two grandparents, his father and then his mother died from cancer. On rushing back from the US to care for his mother, he tried, and failed, to persuade her to use cannabis products to ease her pain, and found it difficult to get access to what were then illegal substances.What explains this dramatic turnaround in a country still led by conservative military men who seem unlikely drug law liberalisers?Part of the reason is politics. Mr Anutin adopted the legalisation of marijuana as his party's signature policy in the 2019 election. The party's stronghold is in Thailand's poor, rural north-east, and the policy appealed to farmers struggling to make a living from growing rice and sugar, and in need of a new cash crop. So, he was able to tell the cheering crowds, as he announced the new law in his political home base of Buriram earlier this month, that he had delivered what he had promised. He believes in the medical benefits of legalisation, which he hopes will allow poorer Thais to grow their own treatments, rather than having to pay for expensive chemical drugs.It is also about business. Mr Kruesopon estimates the marijuana business will generate $10bn (£8.1bn) in its first three years, but could earn a lot more from cannabis tourism, where people come to Thailand specifically for therapies and treatments using marijuana extracts. He has opened the first clinic in Bangkok that focuses solely on these kinds of treatments. Already some of Thailand's biggest corporations are looking at ways in which they can cash in on the weed bonanza. By liberalising the law so quickly and so completely, the government hopes to steal a march on neighbouring countries, many of which may in any case be reluctant to follow the trail blazed by Thailand.But there is a third factor behind the new marijuana regime - a rethinking of the hard-line approach to drug use, which began seven years ago, surprisingly at a time when Thailand was ruled by a military junta. The country has some of the world's most overcrowded prisons, and three-quarters of inmates are there for drug offences, many of them minor. This has not only brought international criticism of the poor conditions in which prisoners have to live, but also cost the government money to sustain them. It was a military minister of justice, General Paiboon Kumchaya, who announced in 2016 that the war on drugs had failed, and another, less punitive method of dealing with the use and abuse of narcotics was needed. When Mr Anutin presented his marijuana policy, with all its enticing economic benefits, he found he was pushing at a relatively open door - though he says it still took a great deal of pushing to get this far. One other result of the change in the law is that more than 4,000 people on cannabis-related charges are now being freed from jail.However, the government may not have been prepared for the enthusiastic embrace of cannabis in all its forms seen across Thailand since the new law was passed. The plant is showing up everywhere - on ice cream, adorning classic Thai dishes and in new smoothie recipes. Someone is even selling chicken meat from birds which have apparently been fed cannabis. The new law makes pretty much anything related to cannabis legal. The government is now drafting additional regulations over its use. Officially its position is that the law only allows cannabis use for medical, not recreational purposes, but it's hard to see how they will enforce that distinction.""We all know from studying other markets that recreational use is where the money's at,"" says Chidchanok Chitchob, a self-styled marijuana enthusiast whose father, a powerful political figure in Buriram, was one of the first to jump on the Thai marijuana bandwagon. ""So I think this should be a good step towards that, if we are really thinking of this as an economic crop.""She is experimenting with different strains of the plant to help local farmers cultivate the right kinds for the region.Mr Kruesopon says he has no issue with further regulation. He advocates sales of marijuana only from licensed vendors, with a prescription, and never to anyone under 18 years old. ""You don't have to overthink this,"" he adds. ""Whatever you are using for cigarettes, use the same thing for cannabis. There are already laws on the books to help control cigarette use, and alcoholic liquor use - just use the same laws.""This is an uncharacteristically bold step by the Thai government, into a brave new world. The rest of the region will be watching to see if it pays off."
115,Thailand legalises cannabis trade but discourages personal use,"People in Thailand can now grow cannabis plants at home and sell the crop after the nation removed marijuana from its banned narcotics list.The nation is the first to advance such a move in South-East Asia, a region known for its stringent drug laws.Advocates say the easing effectively decriminalises marijuana, but personal use for non-medical reasons is still heavily discouraged by the government.Officials have also warned people against smoking in public.Smoking outside is viewed as a public nuisance and offenders risk fines and arrest, authorities have said.But the government is hoping that developing a local cannabis trade will boost agriculture and tourism.It's even giving away one million cannabis seedlings to citizens to encourage pick-up.""It is an opportunity for people and the state to earn income from marijuana and hemp,"" said Anutin Charnvirakul, deputy prime minister and health minister, on his social media accounts last month. Why are so many countries now saying cannabis is OK?‘It’s either cannabis or die’He shared a photo on Facebook of a chicken dish cooked with cannabis, adding that anyone could sell the dish if they followed the rules -  the main one being that products must contain less than 0.2% of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the compound that gives users that ""high"" feeling.From Thursday, households will be able to cultivate up to six cannabis pot plants at home if they register with authorities, and companies can also farm the plant with a permit. Diners will also be able to order cannabis-infused dishes and drinks at restaurants.Clinics across the country can also more freely offer cannabis as a treatment. Thailand was the first in Asia to legalise medicinal cannabis use in 2018.However, using the drug for personal use is still illegal. Officials have warned people against smoking in public, saying it's considered a public nuisance and offenders risked arrest.Under the plan the government says it also aims to release about 4,000 prisoners convicted of cannabis-related offences.Thailand, with its year-round tropical climate, has long had a history with cannabis which many locals commonly used in traditional medicines.A wider draft law on cannabis control is currently being considered in Thai parliament. Advocates believe that coming years could see a gradual relaxing on the rules governing use.So is it legal or isn't it? As Thailand's tourist economy recovers from its long Covid slumber, many visitors will be wondering whether the new liberal regime governing cannabis means they can light up a joint wherever and whenever they please.The answer from the government is no, you cannot smoke marijuana in public, and it is still illegal to sell or supply any extracts containing more than 0.2% of the main hallucinogenic compound THC.The official goal is for Thailand to get a head start on its neighbours in winning a large slice of the lucrative market for health treatments using cannabis derivatives, in particular the milder compound CBD. But there is another motive; to reducing overcrowding in some of the world's most overcrowded jails.Which means, in theory, with cultivation of the plant in any quantities now completely legalised, that the police are now unlikely to arrest people just for possession of marijuana. Already there are hundreds of businesses in Thailand, operating even before the new law, offering a whole range of marijuana products, like restaurants putting the leaves in Thai curries. It is hard to see how the authorities can regulate how much THC they contain. The government insists they are permitting production and consumption solely for medical, not recreational purposes, but in practice that line is already blurred.In a version of this story published on 9 June 2022 we wrote that recreational use was banned. This has been corrected to discouraged."
116,Joe Ferrari: Ex-Thai police chief convicted of suspect killing,"A former Thai police chief has been sentenced to life in jail after being found guilty of murder by torture, in a case that sparked national outrage over police brutality. Thitisan Utthanaphon was nicknamed Joe Ferrari for his many luxury cars. In August, he was arrested after a leaked video surfaced showing him and colleagues wrapping plastic bags around the head of a 24-year-old drug suspect during an interrogation.The suspect later died. On Wednesday, a Thai court found the 41-year-old guilty of murder by torture and sentenced him to death. However the death sentence was immediately reduced to life imprisonment. The court cited his attempts to revive the suspect, Jirapong Thanapat, and that he had paid for the funeral expenses for the family. Five of the six other officers involved in the interrogation were also convicted of murder and given life sentences. A seventh received a smaller sentence due to his testimony.The father of the victim said he felt ""helpless during the ruling, and my wife was crying,"" AFP news agency reported.Jakkrit Klandi said outside the court on Wednesday: ""All seven officers should learn their lesson and pay for their crime.""Footage of the brutal police interrogation went viral last year, prompting Thitisan to flee his post. He later surrendered to police, and in a press conference organised by police, he claimed the suspect's death was an accident.""I did not intend to kill him... I intended to get the information so I can destroy the drug business,"" he said. The high rolling ex-police chief accused of tortureHe also denied accusations that he had demanded a bribe from the suspect during the encounter. According to local reports, the alleged torture occurred after the suspect was told to double a bribe that had been agreed for his release and that of his girlfriend.He was ordered to pay 2 million baht (£46,000; $58,000) to have his charges dropped and was attacked when he refused, according to The Bangkok Post newspaper, which cited a whistleblower's complaint lodged with the police.The case struck a nerve in Thailand where the police force has been accused of being incompetent and corrupt. In the investigation into Thitisan after his arrest, authorities found that he lived in a luxury home in Bangkok, and estimated that he had amassed a fortune of at least 42 cars. One of them was a rare Lamborghini Aventador Anniversario, of which only 100 were made, priced in Thailand at 47 million baht ($1.3m; £1.1m) - about a thousand times more than his monthly salary."
117,Cost of living crisis: Relying on food handouts and moving country,"Millions of people around the world are facing tough decisions as food and energy prices surge.An increase in temperatures linked to climate change has resulted in poor harvests, and the Covid pandemic has led to shortages of goods and workers. In addition, the World Bank has warned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could cause a global recession as gas supplies are cut and fertiliser costs soar.Here, people from five countries share their stories about the impact of the cost of living crisis with BBC correspondents.By Katy Watson, Brazil correspondentFor Rosiane Inácio Bulhões de Oliveira, even buying the basics is hard. The mother-of-four who lives in Araraquara, São Paulo, now relies on handouts and discounted groceries.  She opens her fridge - it's bare, apart from a pot of leftover food.""My boss was about to throw out these beans and bacon, but I rescued the pot just in time,"" she says.In the past year, Brazil has seen double-digit inflation on basic goods and services. One in four people are not getting enough food, despite Brazil being an agricultural powerhouse. Food prices are rising in the country, but salaries haven't kept pace. Supply chain disruption as a result of the pandemic, along with climate change and the rising cost of fertiliser, is pushing up production costs for farmers - which is having a knock-on impact on consumers. Inside Rosiane's home there's a foul smell - a result of the fact it's expensive to keep the place clean. With the price of cooking oil soaring, Rosiane and her father Irandi have come up with a useful skill: turning used oil into soap.By Shaimaa Khalil, Australia correspondentNew Zealand's capital, Wellington, has been ranked one of the least affordable cities in the world for buying a property. The picture is also grim for renters, with a 12% rise in prices in the past year. That, along with increases in petrol and food prices, has led many to consider moving to nearby Australia - where they have the right to live and work. Chris, a builder, his partner Harmony and their four daughters recently left Wellington to start a new life in the Australian city of Brisbane. Despite owning their home and earning reasonable salaries, they were still struggling.""We have four kids, so it was expensive. We'd notice Australians saying you know the cost of living is going up - but that was the cost five years ago in New Zealand,"" says Chris.Leaving New Zealand and the rest of her family was a difficult decision for Harmony. But she says the move was necessary for the children.""You can't make a living in New Zealand. There is no living. You just go backwards. You don't get a choice if you want to live, you have to move, or New Zealand has to change. I want a future for my children and there is none in New Zealand,"" she says.The New Zealand government has tried to increase some short-term measures like fuel subsidies and halving the cost of public transport - but for many, it's not enough.By Jessica Parker, Europe correspondentIn Brescia, Italy, steel runs through the veins of the community. In the past 15 years the industry has endured the financial crash and the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, with the war in Ukraine and Covid lockdowns in China, trade is being disrupted further. Mirella and Lucas met at a cast iron foundry in Brescia. Their two steady wages are up against rising food, petrol and energy costs.""With regard to electricity, we have recently suffered like everyone else. Our bill has doubled - even though we are never at home"", says Mirella. ""We are tightening our belts. Instead of saving a lot, you'll save less,"" says Lucas.Orders at this cast iron foundry continue. But a crucial source of raw materials from the south-eastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol are in now short supply, after Russian troops occupied the region.By Nomsa Maseko, West Africa correspondentMark Impraim owns a catering business in Ghana - one of the most expensive countries to live in, in Africa. He shops for ingredients for one of his most popular dishes - jollof rice - at a local market. But prices have doubled in recent months.Mark looks at a bucket of tomatoes, dismayed at the price tag. ""[This box of tomatoes] used to be 20 cedis [$3; £2]. Now it's going for 40,"" he says. ""I should double the price of the food I serve, but that would scare away customers. I try to find a way around it by decreasing the quantity."" Among other rising costs eating into Mark's weekly budget is a supply of drinking water. Sachets of water have increased in price twice in four months, due to the devaluation of the cedi. Water suppliers say passing the costs on to customers is unavoidable.By Jonathan Head, South East Asia correspondentIn fields now sparkling from the monsoon rains, rice farmer Bunchuay Somsuk and her neighbours scatter the fertiliser that should ensure a good yield. Thai rice is renowned for its quality, and much of the crop in Suphanburi, north of Bangkok, is exported, mainly to the Middle East and Africa.Bunchuay has a notebook where she records her debts. She still owes the equivalent of £400 from last year. With global rice prices low and fertiliser costs rising, she is less likely to cover her costs after this year's harvest.Last April, fertiliser was sold at 550 baht (about $16; £12), but this year it is being sold at three times the price. Thailand imports more than 90% of the ingredients for its fertiliser.The government has been using a price cap to keep costs below global levels, but manufacturers say this is unsustainable as they're losing money. Thailand's rice farmers need large quantities of fertiliser to produce a surplus of crops that can be exported around the world. In order to keep growing it, either fertiliser prices must fall, or the price of rice must increase. A worrying prospect for the many countries that depend on this staple.You can learn more about the stories featured in this article in the Counting the Cost documentary on BBC iPlayer. "

121,The Russians trapped on a Thai island as war rages in Ukraine,"Few places have been as affected by the collapse of tourism in Asia as Phuket, an island less than 50km (31 miles) long, whose famous beaches used to attract around seven million overseas visitors a year. For more than a year after Covid struck, Thailand more or less shut its borders, imposing strict quarantine requirements on anyone arriving from abroad. More than half of the nearly 200,000 tourism-related jobs on Phuket vanished.Last year the Covid restrictions were gradually relaxed, but the country that has been Thailand's biggest source of overseas tourism, China, is still making it very difficult for its citizens to travel. In their place Russians have become the largest group among foreign visitors to Phuket, and about 17,000 arrived in December. As you walk around Phuket's top beaches, Karon, Kata and Patong, you cannot miss the evidence of the recent Russian tourist boom; signs in Cyrillic script, and restaurants offering a taste of home with borscht and pelmeni dumplings on the menu. But now the invasion of Ukraine has stranded around 7,000 Russians in Thailand, many on Phuket, as many airlines have cancelled their flights home.Money is the biggest problem confronting them. Since the sanctions have been imposed on Russia they have been unable to withdraw cash from ATM machines or use their credit cards. Most do not want to speak to journalists, but one couple did agree, if we did not identify them. They worried about repercussions back home, where even calling the events in Ukraine a war can result in prosecution. They told me they had flown to Phuket from Moscow on the day the invasion started, and are now trying to stay in Thailand as long as their money lasts. They are both horrified by the invasion.""We were going from bank to bank, from ATM to ATM. Nine times out of 10 it was declined, but we managed to get some cash. ""There were some other means to get it, like Western Union or cryptocurrency, but it is closing every day. If something was working yesterday, it is not working today.""For the smaller number of Ukrainians who found themselves in Thailand when Russian forces began bombing their cities, the situation is even worse.I met Anton and Alina at a beachside hotel which was being used as a temporary immigration office by Thai officials helping to extend the visas of those who cannot leave the country. They were among a dozen Ukrainians whose lives have been upended by the war. They had been travelling in Thailand since December, and were supposed to fly back to Kyiv in mid-March, but their flight was cancelled, and their families are urging them to stay overseas as long as possible.""We can't relax here, we can't enjoy swimming in the sea"", said Alina. ""Every day we watch and read the news. Unfortunately we can't help our families by going back there.""Alina says her family is in a relatively safe part of Kyiv, but they have still heard Russian missiles striking not far away. For them, it brings back memories of when they had to leave their home city of Donetsk after the conflict started there eight years ago. Anton's family have left Kyiv and moved close to the Hungarian border, so they can cross if the situation deteriorates. Another young woman, who introduced herself as Yulia, came up to me in tears, and showed images on her phone of the destruction in her own city, Irpin, outside Kyiv. Her family has moved into Kyiv, she said, but she was too upset to tell me any more. The stranded Ukrainians are all being offered 90-day visa extensions, but some of them worry that their funds will run out.Local businesses and officials are finding ways to help these tourists.The Ukrainian Embassy in Thailand says it has received more than 100 offers of no-cost accommodation from Thai residents. The Thai government is trying to find other ways for Russians to move funds out here to pay for their stay, including using international transfer apps and the local banking system.When we visited the Veranda restaurant in Karon at lunchtime, with its large plastic bear statue welcoming us at the door, there were just two tables occupied. ""Around the new year we were packed, every day,"" said the manager Dee. ""But our customers can no longer withdraw the funds to pay for their meals."" The restaurant's Russian owner is instead offering customers the option of payment by transfers through cards issued by Russian banks like Sberbank, Alfa and Tinkoff.The Russian couple I met is staying in a budget-priced hotel owned by a Danish company, Plan-B. Co-owner Toke Terkelsen said he is now offering discounts to his Ukrainian and Russian customers, or the chance to move into cheaper rooms. He has allocated a hostel with free beds to those who have run out of cash. Out on the glorious beaches you still hear Russian spoken more than any other language. There are visitors here from Kazakhstan, from Siberian cities like Omsk, Irkutsk and Novosibirsk, all escaping the cold northern winter. But their numbers are just a fraction of those who used to come before Covid, and they are dwindling. Over the next few weeks the Thai government and Russian Embassy say they will explore alternative ways of getting stranded Russians home, either through special evacuation flights or using airlines which are still flying there. Once they are gone, the long hoped-for tourism revival in Phuket will be stalled again, waiting perhaps for more Europeans, for Indians and eventually, for the Chinese to start coming back in the numbers they once did. Toke Terkelsen is confident that will happen soon.""Even with what's happening right now in the world, you still have a lot of people who have been staying at home for two years, who have saved some money and really want to go travelling,"" he said.""If Thailand opens up as the main gateway for Asia, and still the other countries are closed, you will see a lot of people coming to Thailand.""The BBC spoke to young Thai workers in Phuket last year as the island prepared to re-open its beaches ahead of the tourist season."
122,Shane Warne: Australian cricket legend died from natural causes - police,"Australian cricket legend Shane Warne's death in Thailand on Friday was from natural causes, police have confirmed.A senior Thai police official said the post mortem exam showed no signs of foul play in the 52-year-old's death.Warne, who is considered to be one of the greatest cricketers of all time, died of a suspected heart attack on Koh Samui island, where he was holidaying. The Australian government is bringing his body back to Australia where he will be given a state funeral. Warne was a larger-than-life figure whose fame transcended sport and he inspired generations of fans.He was found unresponsive at the Thai villa where he was staying with friends. Attempts to revive him in hospital were unsuccessful. The post mortem exam showed Warne died of a ""congenital disease"", Songyot Chayaninporamet, deputy director of Samui Hospital, told a news conference, Reuters news agency reported.""There is no Covid-19 infection and no sign of assault or murder.""Thailand's deputy police spokesman Krissana Pattanacharoen said in a statement: ""Investigators received an autopsy report today in which a forensic doctor concludes the death was due to natural causes."" He said the player's family had been informed and accepted the findings. Warne is survived by his three children with former wife Simone Callahan.The death of one of Australia's favourite sons has shocked the country, and brought a flood of tributes from cricket fans and others around the world. Warne's family have made their first comments following his sudden death, with his parents, children, ex-wife and brother saying how much they missed him.""To find words to adequately express our sadness is an impossible task for us, and looking to a future without Shane is inconceivable,"" parents Keith and Brigitte said in a statement.""I wish I could've hugged you tighter in what I didn't know were my final moments with you,"" his daughter Summer said.Police say Warne's body will be flown to Australia on Tuesday. Security concerns were raised when a German woman carrying flowers managed to climb into the back of the ambulance  taking the cricketer's body off Koh Samui. Thai police questioned her and later described her as a ""fan who wanted to pay her respects and sincerity"" to Warne.  Melbourne stand to be named after WarneWarne obituary: A fascinating life on and off the fieldWarne's life and career in picturesCricket pays tribute after death of its 'greatest showman'Warne's mastery of leg-spin - a style of bowling that declined during the 1970s and 1980s when fast bowlers dominated - revolutionised cricket.He took 708 Test wickets, the second most of all time, in 145 matches across a stellar 15-year international career.Warne helped Australia win the 1999 50-over World Cup. In 2000, he was named one of the five Wisden cricketers of the century, alongside Sir Donald Bradman, Sir Garfield Sobers, Sir Jack Hobbs and Sir Viv Richards.He retired from international cricket in 2007, going on to a career as a commentator, pundit and coach."
123,Bangkok: Exploring a lost world in an abandoned department store,"Few cities can rival Bangkok’s chaotic and colourful mix of modernity and tradition. Largely unplanned, the Thai capital dazzles visitors with its fast and furious pace, and its dizzying variety of architectural styles. But the city’s galloping development has left some ugly eyesores in the form of abandoned buildings, some of which are in prime locations. One derelict department store, though, has attracted the interest of a group of artists and architects, who have turned it into an art and light exhibit.

124,Blue Diamond Affair: Saudis end dispute with Thailand over stolen gems,"Saudi Arabia and Thailand have ended a 30-year row over a scandal involving stolen jewels and a string of murders.The resumption of full diplomatic ties came during a visit to Riyadh by Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha.A Thai cleaner working for a Saudi prince took the gems in 1989. A rare 50 carat blue diamond was never recovered.Three Saudi diplomats were shot dead in Bangkok following the theft. Several top Thai policemen were implicated in the affair but never convicted.The deal opens the way for Thais once again to find employment in Saudi Arabia, which says it needs millions of overseas workers.It will also allow renewed co-operation in areas such as tourism and petrochemicals. Saudi Arabian Airlines has announced it will restart direct flights to Thailand in May.The mystery of the stolen blue diamondRelations between the two countries were downgraded after Thai cleaner Kriangkrai Techamong stole the jewels from his employer Prince Faisal, the eldest son of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. Kriangkrai sold them back in Thailand without realising their real value. But when the Thai police returned some of the jewels - said to be worth $20m (£14.8m) - the Saudis said most were fake.Then, a year after the theft, three Saudi diplomats in Thailand were shot dead, and an investigator sent there to track the missing jewels disappeared. Two Thais linked to the crime also died in suspicious circumstances. Kriangkrai the cleaner and one police officer were the only two individuals jailed over the affair. Saudi Arabia accused the Thai police of a bungled investigation, amid allegations the stolen jewels were acquired by senior officers. In 1994, the then Saudi charge d'affaires said the murdered diplomats had been ""silenced"".Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha's landmark visit to Saudi Arabia is the highest-level contact between the countries since the bizarre and embarrassing scandal, the BBC's Jonathan Head reports from Bangkok. In a joint statement, the prime minister expressed ""sincere regret over the tragic events in Thailand between 1989 and 1990"".Analysts say the dispute has cost billions of dollars in trade, and led to job losses for tens of thousands of Thai migrant workers. Before the scandal, as many as 300,000 Thais were employed  in Saudi Arabia. Most of the jewels were never found. The scarcity and value of blue diamonds is in part down to the fact so few places in the world mine for them.The stones get their colour when the chemical boron is present during formation.The origin of the Saudi blue diamond is unclear and no known photographs of it exist."

A sickle was found at the scene, they added.The alleged attacker is due in court on Monday, police said in a statement.Police released passport photos of the two men, which show Mr Evans was born in Weston-super-Mare in Somerset and Mr Dagnan was born in Nuneaton, Warwickshire.

127,"Thailand balcony fall: Jill Dodds 'overwhelmed' as £30,000 raised","A teacher badly injured in a fall from a Thailand balcony has been overwhelmed by an appeal to bring her home which has raised more than £30,000.Jill Dodds, 47, sustained spinal injuries on 18 December when the balcony gave way and she plunged 20ft (6m) and landed in a skip.Katie Breeze, 39, of Morpeth, Northumberland, is coordinating efforts to try to return her sister to the UK.She told BBC Look North the money would go towards flights and medical care.""She has done a little thank-you video on YouTube and got a bit emotional at the end. I don't think she thought it would take off as much as it has,"" she said.""Apart from the donations, it is all the support and messages that people have sent with them. She is really overwhelmed with that.""Plea to bring teacher back to UKMs Dodds, who moved from Northumberland to Thailand six years ago, was taking selfies with a friend at an end-of-term party when the balcony gave way.The fall left her with a crushed vertebrae and no movement below her hips. With physiotherapy she has been able to sit up in her hospital bed in ""short bursts"" of 10 seconds, which represents ""really good progress"", Ms Breeze said. ""She has always been really determined and optimistic she is going to get through this,"" she added. ""She still doesn't have a lot of movement in her legs and even though she has more control of her arms and can nudge things, she has no use of her fingers so she is a bit frustrated. ""At heart she is a design teacher and does a lot of creative work with ceramics, pottery and textiles, so that is going to be very frustrating for her not to be able to do things like that.""Ms Breeze said the majority of the money raised so far would go towards flights to bring Ms Dodds back to the UK with a doctor or nurse, as well as creating a comfortable environment for her at home.There are also some outstanding bills for her treatment at a Thai government hospital, with Ms Dodds' insurance not covering all the follow-up care she now requires.""We talk to her every day online but the worst thing is being so far away and not being able to talk to the doctors directly to get information from them ourselves,"" Ms Breeze said.""We just want her back, to have her here with us, and to know exactly what is going on. It is really frustrating. ""At the minute we are just waiting for a date when we can get her discharged from the hospital. We are hoping it is going to be very soon.""Ms Dodds initially went to Thailand on an extended holiday but ""fell in love"" with the country, her sister said.She has taught at various schools there and currently works at Panyadee, the British International School of Samui.

129,Thailand: Tropical bay from 'The Beach' reopens,"A Thai bay that was made famous by its appearance in the film The Beach starring Leonardo DiCaprio has been reopened after more than three years.Maya Bay, on the island of Phi Phi Leh, was closed in 2018 after officials said a sharp rise in visitors had severely damaged the environment.But now tourists are being allowed back due to the ecosystem recovering.A maximum of 375 visitors will be able to visit at a time and swimming will be prohibited for now, officials say.Maya Bay: The beach nobody can touchThailand's beach from The Beach closes""The sharks have come back, coral reefs are regrowing, and the water is clear again,"" Yuthasak Supasorn, the governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, told the Reuters news agency.""These things show that nature will heal if we give it time, and we have to work to keep it that way too.""Boats will only be permitted to dock at a specific locations to avoid damaging coral reefs, officials have said. The beach featured prominently in the 2000 film of that name, and tourism saw a sharp uptick in the following years. In 2008, there were around 170 people visiting per day. But by 2018 the number had grown to around 5,000 and most of its coral died as a result."
130,Selfridges sold for £4bn to Thai-Austrian alliance,"British luxury department store chain Selfridges is being sold to a Thai retailer and an Austrian property firm.The deal for the majority of Selfridges Group is worth around £4bn ($5.4bn), the BBC understands.Founded in 1908 by US retail magnate Harry Gordon Selfridge, the company is best known for its flagship department store on London's Oxford Street.The Canadian wing of the billionaire Weston family bought Selfridges for nearly £600m in 2003.""It is a privilege to be acquiring Selfridges Group, including the flagship Oxford Street store, which has been at the centre of London's most famous shopping street for over 100 years,"" Central Group's chief executive Tos Chirathivat said in a statement.It was revealed earlier this month that Central Group was close to agreeing a deal to take over Selfridges.Selfridges set for £4bn sale to Thai retail giantIkea buys landmark Topshop building in LondonSelfridges Group employs around 10,000 people and owns 25 stores worldwide, including in major cities in England, Ireland, the Netherlands and Canada.Signa and Central will take over 18 of the 25 stores. Selfridges Group's seven Holt Renfrew department stores in Canada were not part of the deal and will remain in the ownership of the Weston family.Selfridges' new owners said they plan to build on the existing brand to develop luxury online stores as well as improving its physical sites. ""Together we will work with the world's leading architects to sensitively reimagine the stores in each location, transforming these iconic destinations into sustainable, energy-efficient, modern spaces, whilst staying true to their architectural and cultural heritage,"" Signa's chairman Dieter Berninghaus said.Selfridges is known for its bright yellow cardboard bags and its flagship store on London's Oxford Street is a magnet for shoppers and tourists alike. Home to luxury brands, a visit is just as much about the experience and beautiful displays as what it is selling.  It even inspired a TV series about the American founder Harry Selfridge, who decided to build the ""biggest and finest"" department store in the world in 1908. Now that ""big, fine brand"" and its buildings have brought its owners, the Weston family, a £4bn Christmas present. Chief Executive of rival Fenwick, John Edgar, a former chief financial officer at the Selfridges Group, described it as a ""great price for a fantastic business"" Analysts say that despite the well-publicised woes of retail through the pandemic, this sale shows that the Selfridges brand is unique. And it also underlines just how popular UK property still remains with international investors. The Weston family - which also owns Fortnum & Mason and has majority control of Primark owner ABF - launched the sales process in June, a few months after the death of W Galen Weston, who oversaw the move to take the department store.Alannah Weston, chair of Selfridges Group and daughter of Galen Weston, said the move is testament to her ""father's vision for an iconic group of beautiful, truly experiential, department stores"".""Creative thinking has been at the heart of everything we did together for nearly twenty years and sustainability is deeply embedded in the business,"" she added.Central, which is owned by the billionaire Chirathivat family, is involved in wide range of businesses including real estate, retail, hospitality and restaurants.The Bangkok-based firm opened its first department store in 1956 and has grown to become Thailand's biggest owner of shopping malls.It also has an e-commerce joint venture with China's JD.com and a stake in south east Asian ride-hailing and delivery giant Grab.Vienna-based Signa Group was founded by entrepreneur René Benko in 2000 and has become Austria's largest privately owned real estate company.The two firms already jointly own major department stores across Europe.The Central-Signa 50/50 bid reportedly beat rival offers from the Qatar Investment Authority, which owns Harrods, and Lane Crawford, a Hong Kong-based department store chain.Before the impact of the pandemic, Selfridges had doubled its profits and reported sales growth of more than 80% since being taken over by the Westons.The family has received more than £580m in dividends from the business over the past decade, but also injected investment into improving the store's experience, with new concepts including an indoor skate park at its London store."
131,Selfridges set for £4bn sale to Thai retail giant,"Luxury department store group Selfridges is set to be sold to a Thai conglomerate for up to £4bn.The UK retailer owns 25 outlets, including a huge flagship store in London's Oxford Street, and branches in Dublin, the Netherlands and Canada.Selfridges' owner, the Weston family, agreed sale terms with Central Group in the last few days, according to the Times, which first reported the deal.Selfridges was founded in 1908 by US retail magnate Harry Gordon Selfridge.It has been owned by the billionaire Westons for 18 years. The Weston family put the chain up for sale in June, a few months after the death of Galen Weston, who oversaw the move to take the department store private in 2003.The family control Selfridges through Wittington Investments Ltd, in Canada, which is separate from the UK arm of the same name that owns a large stake in Primark-owner Associated British Foods. Central Group is a family-owned conglomerate that started in Bangkok but went global when the founder's son, Samrit Chirathivat, opened Thailand's first department store in 1956.It now has 3,700 shops around the world, from supermarkets to electronics outlets, and department stores in Europe.Central Group's non-executive director Vittorio Radice ran Selfridges between 1996 and 2003 and has been managing a department store in Italy since 2006. His role includes responsibility for expansion in Europe.A division of the group, Central Retail, sparked confusion about whether a Selfridges sale had fallen through when it issued a short stock exchange announcement that it was ""not currently involved"" with a deal. However, it is understood the Westons, one of Canada's richest families, are in talks with a different arm of the giant Central Group company.It is unclear why the family has decided to sell, although like many retailers the business has suffered during lockdown and the absence of high-end tourists in city centres.The business had sales of almost £2bn in the year to February 2020, but when more recent accounts are published they are likely to show a big fall.Selfridges declined to comment, and Central Group could not be reached."
132,Thailand: Newspaper rebuked over 'hunts Africans' headline,"A central government agency tasked with managing Thailand's Covid-19 response has reprimanded a local newspaper for its ""poor choice"" of headline.The Bangkok Post had run the headline ""Government hunts for African visitors"" on its front page and website.Thai officials have been attempting to trace 783 travellers who have arrived from various African countries since November 15. Omicron cases have been identified in Asia despite strict travel curbs. ""Let me state clearly and unequivocally that this headline does not in any way reflect the government's policy and or approach nor does it characterise any of the procedures the government has put in place thus far,"" a spokeswoman from the Centre for COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) in a press conference on Friday. ""In fact it was a very poor choice of words and we hope the editors will take good note of the negative feedback it has already elicited,"" she said. The spokeswoman did not mention the paper by name, however images on social media showed the Bangkok Post had run the headline on its front page on the morning of December 2. The article also appeared on the paper's website, though an online search showed the headline had been changed to ""searched for"" instead of ""hunted"".The latest variant of Covid-19, Omicron, was first identified in South Africa on November 25. Initial evidence suggested it has a higher re-infection risk, prompting countries in Asia and around the world to slam their doors shut to travellers from African countries, in an attempt to stop the virus from entering their shores.South Korea has imposed a 10-day quarantine for inbound visitors arriving in the next two weeks, while Indonesia has increased the quarantine period from seven to 10 days for fresh arrivals. How worrying is the new Covid variant?Covid variants: Do we need new vaccines yet?However, cases of Omicron have showed up in multiple countries in the region despite the strict travel restrictions, with Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and India reporting their first identified cases of the variant."
133,Thai court says calls for monarchy reform unconstitutional,"A top Thai court has ruled that calls by three protest leaders to reform the monarchy amount to an attempt to overthrow the political system. The court said speeches made by the activists at mass protests last year were unconstitutional. The ruling could pave the way for treason charges against the trio, who have all denied any wrongdoing. Thailand's lèse-majesté law, which forbids any insult to the monarchy, is among the strictest in the world.In a ruling broadcast on television on Wednesday, justices at the constitutional court described the monarchy as ""the key pillar that the kingdom can't be without"".""Any actions that seek to undermine or weaken the institution show intentions to overthrow the monarchy,"" they said.Last year's mass anti-government protests in Thailand shattered a taboo on criticising the monarchy, though protest leaders were careful to call for changes to the institution, not its abolition. Wednesday's court case concerned a speech by protest leader Panusaya ""Rung"" Sithijirawattanakul, which called for greater transparency over royal finances and the abolition of Thailand's lèse-majesté laws, and others by Arnon Nampa and Panupong ""Mike"" Jadnok. ""If we allow the first, second and third defendant and their networks to keep doing this action, it will not be long to lead to the overthrow of the constitutional monarchy,"" judge Chiranit Havanond said.All three protesters have said they have no desire to topple the monarchy. Kritsadang Nutcharat, a lawyer for Mr Arnon and Mr Panupong, warned that the constitutional court ruling ""could impact [on] future calls for reform"". This ruling effectively closes down any space in Thailand for public discussion of the monarchy, and lays the three activists cited by the court open to charges of treason, which carries the death penalty. However, private discussion and criticism of the monarchy has expanded in recent years, and will certainly continue on social media, despite the government's constant efforts to police and shut down such comment.Today's ruling will also be widely seen as yet another politicised intervention on the side of conservative, royalist forces, by a court which was meant to be independent when it was established more than 20 years ago."
134,Thailand reopens to vaccinated tourists from over 60 nations,"Tens of thousands of travellers are expected to arrive in Thailand today as the country reopens to tourists after 18 months of Covid restrictions. Vaccinated tourists from more than 60 ""low-risk"" nations are allowed to enter the country and avoid hotel quarantine.Tourist numbers are forecast to jump to as much as 15 million next year, bringing in more than $30bn (£22bn).However, much of country still faces restrictions, with only around 42% of the population fully-vaccinated. Thailand is still registering almost 10,000 Covid infections a day.""It's like seeing a very dim light at the end of the tunnel - we haven't been able to work in two years,"" tour guide Chaiyagorn Boonyapak told the BBC. But he and his fellow tour guides haven't been contacted by customers and tour companies yet and it could take a month until tours are back up and running again. ""We don't know if [the government] can really open the country smoothly but I hope they can do it. We would very much love to get back to work again."" The coronavirus pandemic hammered Thailand's economy, which would previously attract 40m tourists a year. Last year, tourist arrivals were down more than 80%.Airports serving Bangkok and Phuket are among those opening to countries including UK, China, Japan, the US and most of Europe.The Thai government predicts revenues to rebound to their pre-pandemic levels by 2023, although many industry experts say China's ongoing border closures will hamper the sector's recovery. Before the pandemic, Chinese tourists made up the biggest number of tourists, with some 12m visitors arriving from China in 2019.Wiwan Siriwasaeree owns TALES Khaosan, a small hostel in the heart of Bangkok's famous tourist street Khaosan Road. She isn't optimistic about the prospect of tourism rebounding to pre-pandemic levels:""I thought to myself what would I do if the situation in Khoasan doesn't get back to the way it used to be, I'm quite fearful about that.""We fear that after we let the tourists in and the new Covid-19 cases spike again, will we go into another lockdown? I'm not so confident about the situation,"" she said. Peeti Kulsirorat, who owns a restaurant in the area, is also fearful that visitors will lead to a spike in cases: ""Then the tourism industry will be blamed as the villain again. It will be the scapegoat just like the way drinking alcohol is.""Mr Kulsirorat said ongoing restrictions - including the inability to sell alcohol in much of the country - will have a negative impact on people's holidays: ""The complete tourism experience has to come in a package of both ambience and convenience. ""If they come here and many things are banned and closed, what's the point of coming here? It will eventually slow down and people will start to get bored with all the restrictions.""Meanwhile, on the popular tourist island of Phuket, the pandemic has brought the economy to a standstill.Dit, whose family owns a sun lounge and juice bar on the island's Kamala beach said they were making about $150 a day in 2019. ""We had to use our savings, grow vegetables and catch fish to survive,"" he said. Now, after months of closure the juice bar has reopened and is generating about $30 each day: ""We don't expect all the deck chairs to be filled straight away.""Reporting by Pasika Khernamnuoy and Katie Silver"
135,Thailand to reopen for some vaccinated visitors on 1 November,"Thailand plans to end Covid quarantine requirements for fully vaccinated travellers from at least 10 low-risk nations from 1 November, officials say.PM Prayuth Chan-ocha admitted that ""this decision comes with some risk"" - but it is seen as a key step to revive the country's collapsed tourism sector.The 10 nations seen as low risk include the UK, China, Germany and the US.The country has been recording more than 10,000 positive infections daily since July. It has fully vaccinated around 33% of its almost 70 million people. Half the population has received one dose.  Mr Prayuth said Thailand would also allow entertainment venues to reopen on 1 December and permit alcohol sales.He added that the authorities were planning to open Thailand for more countries on that date.Mr Prayuth's comments came in a televised address on Monday. Referring to visitors from 10 low-risk nations, he stressed that ""when they arrive, they should present a [negative] Covid test... and test once again upon arrival"".If the second test is also negative, any visitor from those countries ""can travel freely like Thais"", the prime minister said.But he warned that the government would act decisively if there were to be a spike in infections or an emergence of a highly contagious variant of Covid-19.Covid threat looms over Thailand's plans to openIt is estimated that Thailand - popular for its sandy beaches and non-stop nightlife - lost about $50bn (£37bn) in tourism revenue in 2020. The economy suffered its deepest contraction in more than two decades as a result of the pandemic.Thailand was the first country outside China to record a Covid-19 case in January last year. It took the drastic step of sealing its borders in April, effectively killing off a tourist industry accounting for perhaps 20% of GDP, but managed to cut new daily infections to just single figures, one of the best records anywhere. This year though, with the arrival of the Delta variant, infections have soared, from a total of less than 7,000 at the end of 2020, to 1.7 million today. The argument for keeping out foreign visitors to contain Covid became much less persuasive, especially with tourist-related businesses pleading for restrictions to be eased.The success in containing Covid last year had another unforeseen consequence; it led the Thai government to believe it need not rush to order vaccines. The result has been a tardy and at times confused vaccine programme, and a public outcry. The need for some economic good news is in large part what has driven it to start reopening, well before reaching its own declared target of getting 70% of the population vaccinated. It is proceeding cautiously though, with only 10 countries on the list until the end of the year. Like other countries in the region Thailand's health system has limited ICU capacity; in August ICU units in Bangkok were quickly overwhelmed by the number of serious Covid cases.In any case, even with an end to the two week quarantine requirement, a recovery to the 40 million tourists who came in 2019 is unlikely next year, or even the year after.Just over 70,000 visitors came into the country in the first eight months of this year, compared with 40 million in the whole of 2019.Thailand has reported more than 1.7 million confirmed Covid cases since the pandemic began, with nearly 18,000 deaths, according to America's Johns Hopkins University."
136,Covid threat looms over Thailand's plans to open up to tourists,"Back in mid-June, Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha surprised everyone by promising to reopen the country to foreign tourists by October. The time had come, he said, to take that calculated risk. At the time, few took him seriously. Thailand had zealously guarded its borders, imposing quarantine and mountains of paperwork on all arrivals since April last year. Foreign tourism, once an engine of the Thai economy, collapsed. Just over 70,000 came into the country in the first eight months of this year, compared to 40 million in the whole of 2019. Covid-19 was successfully contained through most of 2020, but by June this year infections were rising quickly, and the government was being roundly criticised for being too slow to start vaccinating. Opening up in October seemed impossible.But true to his word, the great reopening appears to have begun, albeit with only very modest steps.  The night-time curfew has been shortened by an hour, starting at 10pm, and libraries and museums can open. You can visit a spa, but only with advanced booking and a recent negative Covid test. Fully-vaccinated tourists will now be quarantined for just one week instead of two. Further minor relaxations are expected in November. This is welcome news for the battered hospitality industry, but hardly sufficient to get the visitors pouring back in.Why is the Thai government proceeding so cautiously? The simple answer is vaccines and the limited number of ICU beds. Despite significantly ramping up its orders of vaccines, the government started late and is still a long way short of its official target of inoculating at least 70% of the population. By the end of September just over one quarter had received two doses, and many of those who received the less effective Sinovac vaccine are now having to get booster shots. What do we know about China's Covid-19 vaccines?Is China's vaccine success waning in Asia?And at the peak of the latest Covid wave in July and August, all Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds in Bangkok were filled, forcing families with seriously ill patients to search frantically for beds in other parts of the country. No-one wants to see a repeat of that distressing experience.But with the known infectiousness of the delta variant, many health experts believe even 70% of the population is too low a target for vaccination before Thailand can fully open to tourists.""The vaccine rate among the older and most vulnerable population should be as high as 85 or 90%"", says Tanarak Plipat, a senior health inspector-general and until recently deputy director of Thailand's Department for Disease Control. ""Overall, given the delta variant, to be safe vaccine coverage for anybody residing in Thailand should be 80%."" Some in the travel industry agree that it is too soon for a full reopening.""Realistically 1 January would be a good time"", Tassapon Bijleveld, Chairman of Thai Air Asia, the country's largest low-cost carrier told the BBC. ""I won't be scheduling any international flights until then"".But there are other barriers to tourism apart from the relatively low vaccination rate. Thailand's famous nightlife cannot restart with the 10pm curfew, with all bars forced to stay closed since early April in Bangkok, and no alcohol permitted in restaurants, although that regulation is now being relaxed on the holiday island of Phuket. The varied requirements for new Covid tests when you cross provincial borders are also proving prohibitively expensive for travellers planning to visit several areas of Thailand.At the stylish Tax bar in an old shophouse in central Bangkok, Niks Anuman Rajadhon and his staff are now preparing for a possible easing of the nightlife ban, spacing out their seating and ensuring good airflow. But after being open for just six weeks this year, he is not optimistic about his business.""For us to stay closed for this long without any compensation has been a disaster. Bangkok is a 24-hour city. Look at everything the bar industry has done for the city, getting top rankings in Asia. I wish they would have more understanding of the hospitality and nightlife business. Right now the government acts as though we never existed,"" he says.Acute economic distress is now very visible in Thailand, in the rows of shuttered shops, in the long queues for food handouts, and in the crowds of angry, unemployed young men who have joined the anti-government protest movement and come out every weekend in parts of Bangkok to fight the police. This is what has forced an unpopular government's hand. But this month's heralded reopening is only the start. They still have a long way to go."
137,ICYMI: Taxi gardens and Egypt's pharaohs on a pencil,Abandoned taxis in Bangkok being used to grow vegetables and other stories you may have missed this week.
138,Thailand Covid: Idle taxis used to grow food for out-of-work drivers,"In a car park in the Thai capital Bangkok, green shoots sprout from the roofs of colourful taxis. Thailand's tough Covid-19 restrictions have left the city's hectic streets quiet, putting taxi drivers out of work. As fares dried up, many drivers left the city for their home villages, leaving so-called taxi graveyards behind. Now, one company has decided to use the roofs of the idle vehicles as small vegetable plots, which they hope can help to feed out-of-work drivers and other employees.Workers at the Ratchaphruek Taxi Cooperative built the miniature gardens by stretching black bin liners across bamboo frames and covering them with soil. They then planted a variety of crops, including chillies, cucumbers and courgettes. It is hoped that after helping the drivers, any leftover food can be sold at local markets. The taxi trade in Bangkok normally relies heavily on tourism but tight restrictions on entering the country means it has almost come to a standstill. ""This is our last option,"" Thapakorn Assawalertkun, one of the company owners, told AFP news agency, adding that many of the vehicles still had large loans outstanding on them.""Growing vegetables on top of the roofs won't damage the taxis since most of them have already been damaged beyond repair. The engines are broken, tyres are flat. There's nothing that could be done,"" he said.Photos subject to copyright. "
139,Joe Ferrari: The high-rolling life of Thailand's controversial ex-police chief,"When a leaked video last month showed a local police chief suffocating a suspect, it was not just the revelation of torture and death in police custody which shocked the Thai public.The former police chief, Colonel Thitisant Utthanaphon, was more commonly known by the moniker ""Joe Ferrari"" - an apparent reference to his expensive tastes. He, along with six others, was pictured wrapping plastic bags around the head of a 24-year-old arrested for selling methamphetamine pills. The suspect eventually died. He has admitted to mistreating the suspect but denied demanding a bribe.When police raided Mr Thitisan's luxury home in Bangkok they found a dozen high-priced cars. The Customs department believes he owns at least 42 cars, one of them a rare Lamborghini Aventador Anniversario, of which only 100 were made, priced in Thailand at 47 million baht ($1.45m; £1.05m). So how did he amass such wealth, at the age of 39, on a salary of just 43,000 baht - or just over $1,000 - a month?Had he not decided to put six plastic bags over the head of the drug suspect, had he not failed to disable one of the CCTV cameras in the room or had another officer not decided to send the video from that camera to a lawyer, little more might have been heard of Joe Ferrari. After failing to resuscitate the suspect, the police took him to hospital and, according to investigating officers, insisted he had collapsed during his arrest. Investigations of abuses by the security forces in Thailand rarely go far.Mr Thitisant's dramatic rise and fall tells us a lot about the Thai police force. The popular image most Thais have from their own experience, is of bumbling lower-ranked officers engaged in petty acts of extortion and self-enrichment. This belies the reality of an institution which has long had an essential role in the opaque power networks which run the country. That is why many ambitious young Thais see the police as a quick route to success and wealth.""The police have long been central to Thailand's political power structure,"" says Paul Chambers at the Center of ASEAN Community Studies in Naresuan University.""Because they have preserved it, armed and legitimised as a domestic enforcement agency for the palace, the army, and for powerful people. In return they are allowed to operate endless extortion rackets with impunity as a sort of legal mafia. As a result, Thailand often 'discovers' Joe Ferrari-type cases in the police.""Born into an ordinary family in Bangkok, Mr Thitisant won a place at the prestigious Armed Forces Academies Preparatory School, and went on to the Police Cadet Academy, graduating in 2003. Former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra chose exactly the same career path. Both institutions enable students to make important connections with future military and police leaders.From there Mr Thitisant went into the narcotics suppression unit in Bangkok, and then for a period in Narathiwat in the deep south, near the notoriously porous border with Malaysia. Policing the huge illegal drugs trade in Thailand is known to be a rich source of illicit funds for officers. At some point Mr Thitisant also got involved in confiscating luxury cars, another lucrative operation. Thailand imposes taxes of more than 300% on supercars like Ferraris, Rolls-Royces and Lamborghinis, for which, in a country with plenty of billionaires, there is a large market. This has created a substantial business in tax avoidance, either by bribing customs officers to report a much lower value for the cars, or describing them as parts or partially-assembled. Some are stolen in other countries and smuggled in. Confiscated cars are auctioned, and until recently the police and officials were paid ""finders fees"" of around half the value, netting well-connected officers millions of dollars.Thai customs officials say Mr Thitisant confiscated 368 such cars since 2011, which could potentially have earned him around 400 million baht.In 2009 he married into a wealthy family, posting pictures enjoying high society events with his new wife. Then in 2014 he made headlines by proposing marriage to a high-profile actress in a videoed ceremony, going down on one knee with a large bouquet of flowers. When challenged over his existing marriage, he said he had left his wife, but the actress refused him. In 2017 she told Thai media he had promised her 230 million baht in cash. He has most recently been in a relationship with another well-known television personality, whose father was his boss, the powerful regional police commander in northern Thailand where Mr Thitisant's last two postings were.With his flamboyant lifestyle and conspicuous taste for luxury cars, Mr Thitisant made no effort to hide his wealth. After all, many of Thailand's most senior police officers declare millions of dollars in assets they could not possibly have accrued on their regular salaries. This year Forbes listed a recently-retired deputy police chief, Wirachai Songmetta, as the 36th wealthiest man in Thailand, based on a substantial energy business his family owned and ran for many years even while he was rising up the ranks. Top policemen can expect to move into other lucrative senior positions, in politics or business. Getting rich in the police is easy, because in a country where law enforcement is, to put it politely, flexible, there are endless opportunities to make money.""There are so many that I can't name them all,"" says Major Chavalit Laohaudomphan, a former police officer and now an MP in the opposition Move Forward party. ""Let's just say that for anything that's illegal, the police can ask for bribes to turn a blind eye. Even for ordinary citizens who come for help, like those who need the police to hunt down a culprit for them - the police also ask for money in the form of 'the cost to proceed the case'. ""And remember, lower-ranked police officers then have to pay their bosses, to ensure they rise to a position where they can make even more money.""One of the lawyers who received the leaked video says Mr Thitisant was heard demanding a substantial bribe, while suffocating the unfortunate suspect. Informed sources believe that, though a fast-rising star in the police, he was just a cog in the money-making machinery, making plenty himself, but funnelling much of it up to more powerful players, who, until his misjudgement with the plastic bags, would almost certainly have protected him. Successive Thai governments have promised to reform the police, but none of those promises has yet been fulfilled."
140,Jo Ferrari: Wanted Thai police chief surrenders after manhunt,"A former Thai police chief who went on the run after allegedly torturing a suspect to death has surrendered.Thitisan Utthanaphon, nicknamed ""Jo Ferrari"", admitted to mistreating the suspect but denied any corruption.He spoke to the media in an unusual press conference organised by the police on Thursday night.Mr Thitisan had fled his post after a video showing the apparent torture and killing of a drug suspect was leaked, causing public outrage.The footage, which was reportedly filmed by a junior officer, shows several policemen wrapping plastic bags around the head of a 24-year-old arrested for selling methamphetamine pills. The suspect had allegedly refused to pay a bribe.Mr Thitisan and six others at a police station in Nakhon Sawan, 250km (150 miles) north of Bangkok, were accused of being responsible for the fatal incident, which took place earlier this month.The 39-year-old former police superintendent went on the run, but gave himself up on Thursday evening in Chon Buri province, hundreds of kilometres from his station.In a last-minute press conference organised by Thai police in Bangkok, Mr Thitisan answered questions from reporters over a mobile phone that was held up to a microphone. It is not common for Thai police to allow suspects to speak to media immediately after their arrest.Mr Thitisan claimed the suspect's death was an ""accident"". ""I did not intend to kill him... I intended to get the information so I can destroy the drug business,"" he added.He said it was the first time he had ever treated a suspect this way, adding that multiple bags were used to cover the suspect's head because he kept trying to remove them.Mr Thitisan also insisted that he had not tried to extort money. ""My subordinates just followed my order and I take sole responsibility,"" he added. According to local reports, the alleged torture occurred after the suspect was told to double a bribe that had been agreed for his release and that of his girlfriend.He was ordered to pay 2 million baht (£45,000; $61,000) to have his charges dropped and was attacked when he refused,  according to The Bangkok Post newspaper, which cited a whistleblower's complaint lodged with the police.The video shows attempts to revive the man, but he died from suffocation. The officer allegedly told subordinates to list the cause of death as a drug overdose.Mr Thitisan's moniker is an apparent reference to his expensive tastes. On Wednesday a search of Mr Thitisan's luxury estate in Bangkok revealed 13 supercars.Jonathan Head, BBC News in BangkokHow do you put a positive spin on a video showing a senior police officer suffocating a suspect in custody with a plastic bag?Thai national police chief General Suwat Jangyodsok decided the best strategy was to seek sympathy for Colonel Thitisan; he had agreed to surrender to save the honour of the force, he told journalists. He allowed him to express, through a phone, his remorse to the crowd of waiting journalists. We were even told that Colonel Ferrari was contemplating suicide.Many Thais have pointed out that there was little honour to save. The police force is almost universally ridiculed in Thailand for its incompetence, its corruption, and for putting on bizarre spectacles like this one for journalists. Who can forget the police awarding themselves, at a press conference, an $80,000 reward for catching two suspects in the 2015 Bangkok bombing, although six years later neither suspect has been tried in court? Or the practice, not unique to Thailand in this region, of making suspects re-enact the crimes of which they are accused in front of the public? Or the litany of laughable excuses given over nine years for failing to arrest the heir to the wealthy Red Bull business, who allegedly killed a police officer while driving his Ferrari at speed?Thai media have noted that action against Colonel Ferrari was only taken, two and half weeks after the incident, when the video was leaked. Few believe much would have happened to him without the leak. His spectacular collection of luxury cars and properties, on a salary of perhaps $1,500 a month has raised fewer eyebrows here. Senior police officers in Thailand are often conspicuously wealthy. Promotion is widely presumed to involve spending huge sums of money for the required backing. Policing is sometime described as more of a business than a public service. The details emerging from this case will only confirm that view.In 2015, Thai police gave themselves a cash reward for the arrest of a man suspected of carrying out the bombing of a shrine in Bangkok."

145,Thailand bans coral-damaging sunscreens in marine parks,"Thailand has banned sunscreens containing chemicals that damage coral from all of its marine national parks. Concerns are growing that lotions tourists use for sun protection are harming slow-growing corals.The Thai Department of Conservation said four ingredients commonly found in sun creams were shown to destroy coral larvae, obstruct coral reproduction and cause reef bleaching. Anyone flouting the ban can be fined up to 100,000 baht (£2,100).However, officials have not said how they plan to enforce the new rule.The banned lotions are those containing oxybenzone, octinoxate, 4-methylbenzylidene camphor or butylparaben.Similar bans have been introduced by the Pacific island of Palau and the US state of Hawaii.This is the latest attempt by the Thai government to protect its coral from the tourism industry.

147,Covid: Is China's vaccine success waning in Asia?,"Across Asia, Chinese vaccines have played a crucial role in immunising people against Covid-19, with millions receiving either a Sinovac or Sinopharm jab.But in recent weeks, concerns have grown about their efficacy. Now, some Asian countries which made Chinese vaccines a key plank in their immunisation programmes have announced they will use other jabs.The move has raised questions, not only about whether China's vaccines can be trusted, but also about its attempts at vaccine diplomacy in Asia. Last week, Thailand announced it was changing its vaccine policy - instead of receiving two Sinovac shots, residents will now get a mix of Sinovac and AstraZeneca. Healthcare workers who are already fully vaccinated with Sinovac will also get a different jab as a booster shot.Indonesia announced a similar move the previous week, saying it was giving Moderna booster shots to healthcare workers immunised with Sinovac. The decisions followed reports that hundreds of fully vaccinated healthcare workers had caught Covid, with some of them - two in Thailand and 30 in Indonesia - dying.Dying alone in Indonesia's grim battle with Covid-19Both countries, which have seen slow rollouts of their vaccination programmes, have been battling new outbreaks. Thailand is now reporting record high numbers of infections and deaths, while Indonesia - the new epicentre of Covid in Asia - has seen overcrowded hospitals and oxygen shortages.The two countries said they were making the switch to increase protection, and Thai officials cited local studies which showed mixing vaccines could boost immunity.Indonesia's tourism minister Sandiaga Uno also recently told the BBC the Sinovac vaccine was ""quite effective"".But by choosing to switch vaccines, the Thai and Indonesian governments were essentially ""saying they are concerned about vaccine failure"", said Dale Fisher, who heads the World Health Organization's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network.However, he also cautioned that there was not enough information about the healthcare workers' infections and deaths, and urged authorities to conduct a ""thorough investigation"". Sinovac has yet to comment.Since then, Malaysia announced it was switching to Pfizer's vaccine after it finished its Sinovac supplies. But other countries like the Philippines and Cambodia are continuing to use Chinese vaccines.In clinical trials across the world, Sinovac and Sinopharm's inactivated virus vaccines have been shown to be 50% to 79% effective in preventing symptomatic Covid infection.But they are still highly effective in preventing Covid hospitalisations or deaths - studies found Sinovac's jab was 100% effective in Brazil and 96 to 98% effective among Indonesian medical workers.What do we know about China's Covid-19 vaccines?The fact that there are still numerous breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated people could be due to several factors, says epidemiologist Professor Benjamin Cowling, of Hong Kong University.One is that the Chinese vaccines, like many other vaccines, may wane in efficacy over time. A Thai study released this week found that antibodies in those fully vaccinated with Sinovac decline by half every 40 days. Another is that the clinical trials had smaller datasets compared to real-world infections, particularly in Indonesia which is seeing soaring daily infection numbers in the tens of thousands.It could also be due to the more infectious Delta variant, which has been detected in 60% of recent cases in Indonesia and 26% of cases in Thailand's capital Bangkok.There is no public data yet on the Chinese vaccines' efficacy against any of the Covid variants. But preliminary studies have suggested that inactivated virus vaccines, like Sinopharm and Sinovac's, could offer 20% less protection against the Delta variant than against the original virus, according to Prof Cowling. No vaccine is fully effective in preventing Covid infection, he said, and while the Chinese vaccines ""are not 100% effective, they are still saving many lives"". Experts stress that breakthrough infections do not mean vaccines are pointless, as immunisation helps to stop people from getting very sick with Covid-19.There are also no reports yet of breakthrough infections in China, where more than 630 million have taken at least one shot of a Chinese vaccine. It is not known how many of them are fully vaccinated.But the virus is thought to be controlled in China, which is reporting low daily infection rates and has moved swiftly to stamp out local outbreaks.As the region that's received the most number of Chinese shots, Asia has been a key linchpin in China's vaccine diplomacy strategy. More than 30 Asian countries have bought jabs or received donated shots. Indonesia is one of the biggest buyers of Sinovac vaccines in the world having ordered 125 million doses.China's eagerness to sell or donate vaccines has been ""an effort to  change the narrative away from the fact that infections were first detected in Wuhan, and to show that it's a scientific powerhouse"", said China expert Ian Chong, of the National University of Singapore.With richer countries monopolising many of the early orders of other vaccines, many countries in Asia - particularly poorer ones - welcomed the Chinese jabs. ""The standard thinking was that 'some protection is better than no protection', even though at the time efficacy data wasn't great,"" said Dr Chong.Thailand, for instance, had initially counted on a local firm owned by the king to produce the bulk of its vaccines, but the slow delivery timeframe forced the government to seek other sources after fresh Covid outbreaks this year.Besides locally manufactured AstraZeneca vaccines, it has ended up relying mostly on Sinovac's jab for now, because the Chinese firm was one of the first to deliver.Thailand and Indonesia's decisions to switch to other vaccines ""could potentially puncture the image of success, bursting the bubble of effectiveness of Chinese vaccines, and in effect calls into question the technical prowess of China,"" said Dr Chong.The Chinese government has yet to comment, but in the past has insisted that its vaccines are effective.Both Thailand and Indonesia's governments are facing mounting criticism over their slow vaccination rollouts and worsening Covid situations.In Thailand, the outrage has been further fuelled by a leaked health ministry document quoting an official who opposed giving medical workers a Pfizer booster shot as it would be ""an admission that Sinovac can't give protection"".""There is a lot of anger among the Thai public, they're saying 'why don't you care about healthcare workers', 'this should not be a factor'. Many people have deep concerns about the government's communications and reliance on Sinovac,"" said Dr Arm Tungnirun, director of the Chinese Studies Center at Chulalongkorn University. ""Right now there is an increasing number of people who reject Sinovac, who believe it's not effective. There's a big distrust in the Thai government, and the vaccine issue has become heavily politicised.""On Sunday, hundreds of protesters marched in Bangkok calling for the prime minister's resignation over his handling of the crisis, and also demanded that mRNA vaccines such as Pfizer or Moderna's be brought in .There are fears that the latest reports of breakthrough infections will fuel overall scepticism in vaccines. In Indonesia, religious social media influencers and conspiracy theorists have already been spreading anti-vaccine messages laced with anti-Chinese sentiment.Experts are urging tighter infection controls and greater efforts in combating misinformation online.Says Prof Cowling: ""It's great that we are using [the Chinese vaccines] but we can't expect too much of them.""We have to recognise that there will be breakthrough infections and be ready to deal with them, because they can damage confidence in the vaccines."""
148,Covid vaccine: Thailand decides to mix jabs as cases spike,"Thailand has changed its vaccine policy to mix China's Sinovac with the AstraZeneca vaccine in a bid to boost protection. The decision comes after hundreds of medical workers caught Covid despite being fully vaccinated with Sinovac.Instead of two Sinovac shots, people will now receive the AstraZeneca vaccine after their first Sinovac shot. Health workers already fully vaccinated with Sinovac will also receive a third booster from a different vaccine.This can be either the AstraZeneca vaccine, or an mRNA vaccine like Pfizer/BioNTech. This third dose will be given three to four weeks after their second Sinovac jab, said the country's National Infectious Disease Committee on Monday. AstraZeneca is currently the only other vaccine available in the country, with Pfizer/BioNTech shots donated by the US set to arrive soon. Thailand first received Sinovac vaccines from China and began giving shots to its health workers in February. On Sunday, the health ministry said out of more than 677,000 medical staff who were fully vaccinated with Sinovac, 618 were infected between April and July.  One nurse has died and one medical staff is still in critical condition. According to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showing results from Chile, Sinovac has an efficacy rate of 65.9% against Covid-19, is 87.5% effective at preventing hospitalisation and 86.3% effective at preventing death. Thailand is currently in the midst of a spike of new infections, reporting a record high of 9,418 on Sunday. The death toll for the previous day stood at 91, also a record number.Concerns over the efficacy of the Chinese vaccine amid rising cases have sharply driven demand for other shots offered by some private clinics. Last week, one clinic selling the US Moderna vaccine on an online shopping platform saw its offer sold out within minutes. The Phyathai Hospital offered 1,800 vaccination slots for a single Moderna shot at 1,650 Thai baht ($50, £36) via Shopee.Overall, Thailand has seen more than 345,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and nearly 2,800 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, according to figures collated by Johns Hopkins University from around the world. There are concerns that the spike in cases in many South East Asian countries is due to the spread of the more infectious Delta variant, first discovered in India. "
149,Thailand's plans to fully re-open in doubt as virus cases spike,"Thailand's plan to re-open the country to foreign tourists in about 100 days has been thrown into doubt as it sees a new spike in Covid cases. Some 7,000 cases and 75 deaths were reported on Thursday, a daily record for the country.Thailand had last year seen success in combating the virus, with cases at one point dwindling to single digits.But a spike in cases, linked to the highly infectious Delta strain, means its plans might have to be put on hold.The rise in cases have put the country's medical system under strain - with reports suggesting that many hospitals have already run out of beds for critically ill patients. Authorities announced earlier this week that they planned to convert a terminal at its airport into a field hospital with an intensive-care unit. The hospital will provide at least 5,000 beds.Once a bustling holiday hotspot, Thailand's tourist industry has been hit especially hard by the pandemic. Last month, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha set a 120-day target for the country to be fully reopened, with all businesses back to normal and freedom for vaccinated tourists to travel across the country. He said Thailand could not ""wait for a time when everyone is fully vaccinated with two shots, or for when the world is free of the virus, to reopen"". Earlier last week, Thailand opened its doors to its first batch of quarantine-free tourists in Phuket. Around 2,000 travellers have entered there since the ""Phuket Sandbox"" - the island's scheme to revive tourism - began. On Wednesday, Phuket reported its first overseas Covid-19 case - a male traveller from the United Arab Emirates.Most of the country's cases, however, can be traced to the capital Bangkok. Experts say the only way out of this is a lockdown. Stricter curbs have been placed on the city's restaurants and construction sites, but a full lockdown has so far been avoided. ""A strict lockdown is the only way out,"" Dr Anan Jongkaewwattana, a director of the research unit at the National Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, told Bloomberg. ""If this situation continues, the Thai outbreak will be worse than Indonesia's on a per capita basis, with as many as 20,000 cases per day in the next few months,"" he said. But some businesses say they cannot endure further lockdowns. ""If [my restaurant] closes down, what will I do? Will I have to give up everything I've built and lay off all my staff?"" one restaurant owner told the BBC. The country is also struggling on its vaccination front - failing to meet its monthly vaccination target of 10 million doses. Earlier last week, a senior health official admitted that only 5-6 million doses of the AstraZeneca jab would be available in Thailand. The director of the National Vaccine Institute said the country would have to secure vaccines from other manufacturers in order to meet its goal.According to the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok, there is growing public anger over the government's failure to order enough vaccines - with vaccines having run out in many areas. Around 15% of Thailand's population has received at least one vaccine dose - with 4.3% of that total having received both shots. "
150,Thailand: Phuket welcomes first international tourists,"Thailand has welcomed its first quarantine-free tourists back to the island of Phuket as the country tries to reboot its tourism industry.About 250 people, mainly from the Middle East, were expected to arrive on four flights on Thursday as part of the ""Phuket Sandbox"" scheme.None of the arrivals need to quarantine, but they cannot travel to the mainland within 14 days.It is hoped the scheme will bring in $278m (£201m) in the next three months.But that is still far short of Thailand's pre-pandemic revenue from tourism, which accounts for about a fifth of the country's economy. According to news agency Reuters, Thailand lost around $50bn when visitor numbers plunged following the start of the Covid-19 outbreak in 2020.If successful, the country will roll out the scheme to other islands, with borders scheduled to open more fully in October.""We know that there is a risk,"" Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha told reporters after arriving on the island himself. ""But we have to accept the risk so Thai people can make a living.""But this attempt to revive tourism comes as Thailand battles to get its latest Covid outbreak under control. On Thursday, it reported a record 57 deaths and 5,533 cases. Two Delta variant cases have also been found on Phuket so far.But the island has been prioritised for vaccination, and some 70% of its residents were due to be inoculated before the first tourists arrived on planes from Israel, Abu Dhabi and Qatar.The holidaymakers, who need to arrive vaccinated and provide proof of a negative test before entry to Phuket, will themselves undergo screening procedures before being allowed out onto the island. Their movements will then be monitored by an app they must download on arrival. Those who want to travel more widely in Thailand will be able to do so after 14 days, so long as they have three negative coronavirus tests."
151,Young Thai workers race to reopen deserted beaches,"Thailand depends on its tourism sector, and normally welcomes 14 million visitors annually. But Covid-19 saw visitor numbers plunge to just four million last year. In the key resort of Phuket, mass vaccinations are being organised ahead of this year's tourist season. As part of our My Work, My Future season, young Thais in Phuket share their hopes and fears about future employment in the country's tourist industry."
152,US returns ancient stone carvings to Thailand,"Two ancient sandstone carvings, believed to have been stolen from Thailand and smuggled to the US during the Vietnam War, are being repatriated. The carvings were originally lintels - support beams - in temples dating back to the 10th Century and feature the Hindu deities Indra and Yama. For decades they have been on display in San Francisco's Asian Art Museum. They are due to go on display at the National Museum in the Thai capital, Bangkok. The San Francisco museum said it always wanted to return the beams to Thailand, but disputed experts' allegations that they had been stolen.""We are very pleased that these lintels are going back to their country of origin,"" said Jay Xu, the museum director, in a statement.The repatriation followed a three-year investigation by the US Department of Homeland Security.Agents learned that the relics had been illegally imported, making them forfeitable under federal law, CBS reported. In February, the US reached a settlement with the city of San Francisco which agreed to forfeit the items.Thai Fine Arts Department Director General Prateep Pengtako told AFP news agency that the lintels showed the influence of the ancient Khmer Kingdom, which was based in modern-day Cambodia.A guide to Africa's 'looted treasures'Who should own indigenous art?How UK museums are responding to Black Lives MatterAberdeen University to repatriate 'looted' Nigerian sculpture""The lintels were assessed to be taken away some time between 1958 and 1969. In particular, 1965-66 saw a lot of Thai artefacts go missing,"" he said.It is believed the artefacts came from Prasat Khao Lon historical sanctuary, in Sa Kaeo province, and Prasat Nong Hong, in Buri Ram province, the Bangkok Post reported.A handover ceremony took place in Los Angeles earlier this week between US authorities and the Royal Thai Consulate General.""The return of these antiquities holds great importance in terms of history, archaeology, and culture to the Thai government and the Thai people,"" the Thai foreign ministry said at the time. ""It is believed that both of the sacred lintels were illegally exported from Thailand around the 1960s during the Vietnam War.""In recent years, other countries have also seen calls to repatriate stolen artefacts.In 2014 Australia agreed to return to India two ancient Hindu statues allegedly stolen from temples while last year France agreed to return to Senegal and Benin items that were looted during colonial times."
153,Thai cave rescuer to tell inside story of mission,"A diver who played a key role in the rescue of 12 boys from a flooded cave in Thailand is writing a book about how the mission unfolded. John Volanthen was the first person to make contact with the young members of a football team and their coach who became trapped underground in 2018.He used the latest lockdown to write a book on the inside story of the rescue.""I hope it will provide inspiration and hopefully useful information,"" said the diver, who is from Bristol. The Wild Boars football team, aged 11 to 16, became trapped 4km (2.5 miles) inside in the Tham Luang caves on 23 June 2018 after heavy rainfall.Mr Volanthen was among the experts enlisted to bring the boys to safety.""When we surfaced we saw lights and could smell something, we could smell humanity,"" he told the BBC. ""One by one the boys starting walking down a mud bank and we had found the team lost for ten days.""My feeling was that it was completely unbelievable they were all alive. ""The scenarios in my mind were of finding all of them dead or having to separate the living from the dead, so it was a feeling of disbelief and pure joy,"" he said.Mr Volanthen was awarded the George Cross for bravery and as well as his book, a movie of the rescue mission is currently in production. Director Ron Howard is currently filming in Australia, with Irish actor Colin Farrell playing Mr Volanthen.""I'm extremely proud that Ron Howard has picked up on the story and is shooting a movie,"" Mr Volanthen said.""I'm being played by Colin Farrell who I have to admit I had not heard of, but I've spoken to him since and I'm honoured that he's happy to play me. ""I said before that I wanted Rowan Atkinson to play my part. ""I suggested that to Ron Howard and he looked horrified and said: 'We're not making that sort of movie',"" Mr Volanthen added.Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

154,Thailand: Record number of Covid cases as prison clusters grow,"Thailand has seen its highest number of daily Covid cases, with the majority of the new infections stemming from the country's overcrowded prisons. Some 6,853 prisoners make up for 9,635 of Monday's new cases - more than double the previous daily record.Thailand admitted there were growing clusters in jails after several prominent activists tested positive.The country has managed to keep coronavirus numbers low for the last year, but saw a huge spike last month.A total of 111,082 cases have been reported since the beginning of the pandemic. The previous highest daily total was 4,887 on 13 May, according to Johns Hopkins University.It also reported 25 new deaths on Monday, bringing the total number of fatalities to 614.""Many people warned the Thai authorities that they needed to act proactively to avoid such a situation, but it seems they got caught sleeping at the switch,"" said Human Rights Watch's Asia director in a statement released earlier this month.According to the Thai government, almost half of those tested across eight prisons were found to have Covid-19 - 10,748 out of 24,537 inmates. In the worst-hit prison, in the northern province of Chiang Mai, some 61% of inmates tested positive. But a Corrections Department official told reporters at a press conference on Monday that not much could be done ""in reality"". ""Even though there's a command from the Corrections Department director-general for everyone to wear a mask 24 hours a day, in reality it can't be done because (inmates) would have to take a shower and eat. Some are taken out to courts and have to eat there. No one can eat with their mask on,"" said deputy director-general Dr Veerakit Harnparipan. ""What has happened is something beyond the Corrections Department's capacity because we can't turn down new inmates,"" Dr. Veerakit added.However, the Corrections Department added that 12,000 vaccine doses had been secured for inmates and they were trying to procure more. The quarantine period for new prisoners has now been increased to 21 days and testing has been ramped up.Just last week, most of the country's cases had stemmed from just two prisons outside the capital Bangkok. The Ministry of Justice had said then that these two prisons had to constantly accept new inmates. According to a report by news agency AFP, only 10 cases were reported in Bangkok Remand Prison on 25 April. This figure jumped to 1,960 last week.Human Rights Watch says there are some 380,000 inmates in Thailand's 143 prisons, adding that there were all ""at grave risk from Covid-19 outbreaks"". It called on Thai authorities to ""ensure prisoners and detainees have access to adequate protective measures"", as well as to ""swiftly reduce overcrowding by releasing people who do not pose a serious and concrete risk to others.""However, Thai authorities said the number of inmates had been reduced to 310,000 due to overcrowding alleviation policies. The latest outbreak comes days after Thailand announced plans to allow restaurants to resume dine-in services in Bangkok, though an official added that this would be capped at 25%. However, entertainment venues still remain closed and malls nationwide close at 21:00 local time. Thailand has so far administered 2.2 million vaccine doses to frontline workers and those in at-risk groups. Before the current outbreak largely appeared to have kept Covid-19 in check, recording a low death toll for a nation of 70 million people that shares porous borders with four countries, including Myanmar."
155,Myanmar: Journalists who fled coup face Thailand deportation,"Three journalists and two activists who fled from Myanmar are set to go on trial in Thailand on charges of illegally entering the country. If found guilty they are likely to be deported back to Myanmar, where they say their lives would be in danger. The trial was to begin on Tuesday in Chiang Mai but was postponed for another six days. Since the military coup on 1 February, dozens of journalists have been arrested and charged in Myanmar. More than 700 people have been killed by security forces and thousands have been detained.There have since been multiple reports of detainees being tortured while in custody, with some dying from their injuries.How Myanmar coup caused its healthcare to vanishThe TikTok loving teen and others killed in MyanmarCould sanctions on Myanmar's military ever work?The group of five, who have yet to be named by Thai authorities, were detained by police in the city of Chiang Mai on Sunday. They are three journalists from well-known broadcaster Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB), and two activists.Charged with illegal entry into Thailand, they could face immediate deportation if found guilty. Like many media organisations, DVB has been banned from operating inside Myanmar, also referred to as Burma.The broadcaster said it ""strongly urges the Thai authorities to not deport them back to Burma, as their life will be in serious danger if they were to return"".DVB also urged the United National High Commissioner for Refugees in Bangkok and the international community to help. With a common border stretching more than 2,000km (1,200 miles), Thailand is a natural haven for those fleeing violence and repression in Myanmar. Many dissident media organisations based themselves in Thailand during the long periods of military rule in the past, and since the coup in February dozens of journalists and activists have once again crossed the border to escape arrest. Until now the Thai authorities have mostly turned a blind eye to these fugitives, many without passports or visas.The country has accommodated large numbers of refugees in the past, often for many years. But it has not signed the United Nations Convention and Protocol on Refugees, and has at times deported groups of them even when they faced almost certain arrest, or worse, at the hands of their own governments.Human Rights Watch (HRW) on Tuesday called on Thailand to release the group and not send them back to Myanmar. ""They will face certain arrest and persecution"" in Myanmar, Asia Director Brad Adams said in a statement. ""The junta's hostile actions towards DVB were made clear when it revoked the DVB's media licence in March. Just last week, the junta criminalised ownership of satellite dishes, in part to prevent DVB's satellite broadcasts from reaching the Burmese people.""The Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand also called for the five to be granted  the right to remain in the country.""The world is watching what the Thai authorities do in this important case for press freedom in Myanmar and the region, and for the protection of those fleeing the junta's brutal crackdown on independent media and civil society.""Myanmar coup: What is happening and why?Street tales from Myanmar: 'Take care of our baby if I die'According to the FCCT, more than 70 journalists are among the 5,000 people arrested in Myanmar since the February coup, adding that most are in detention at a time when there have been widespread reports of torture and extrajudicial killings.The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) monitoring group says 50 journalists are still in detention and half of those have been prosecuted. A few foreign journalists have also been arrested.Myanmar's military has justified the February takeover by alleging there had been widespread fraud during a general election late last year which had returned elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy party (NLD) to power.The military promised instead that it would hold ""free and fair"" elections once the state of emergency is over."
156,Thailand court allows minister to keep post despite drug conviction,"Thailand's top court has allowed a government minister to keep his job, dismissing a bid to disqualify him over a past conviction for drug trafficking in Australia.Thammanat Prompao was jailed for four years in 1994 for his role in a heroin smuggling case.Opposition politicians urged Thailand's constitutional court to declare the minister ""unfit for office"".But in a ruling on Wednesday, the court rejected the complaint.The court said it did not recognise Mr Thammanat's conviction because the verdict was delivered in Australia, a foreign country.""The verdict of any state only has effect in that state,"" the court said. Therefore, Mr Thammanat ""is not prohibited from holding office"" under Thailand's constitution, the court said.The ruling meant that Mr Thammanat could remain a member of parliament and keep his post as a cabinet minister in Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha's government.The conviction was brought to wider public attention in 2019 after Mr Thammanat's appointment as deputy agriculture minister.Mr Thammanat has denied reports of his imprisonment for conspiring to import 3.2kg (7lbs) of heroin - worth about AU$4.1m ($3.1m; £2.2m) - to Australia.The former army captain, 55, said he had been caught with flour, not heroin.But Mr Thammanat came under scrutiny again after two Australian newspapers, The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald, reported details of his conviction, citing clippings of old news stories.The Sydney Morning Herald said Mr Thammanat was arrested in 1993, served four years in prison and was deported immediately on release.BBC Thai also obtained court records from Australian authorities that confirmed Mr Thammanat's conviction and prison sentence.Mr Thammanat began his political career in Thailand at the end of the 1990s. A former captain in the Royal Thai Army, he built connections with General Prayuth Chan-ocha, who came to power after a military coup in 2014.Mr Thammanat has described himself as a key figure in forming the coalition government led by Mr Prayuth. Elections in March 2019 saw Mr Prayuth confirmed in office with the support of the Palang Pracharath Party, a conservative party with close ties to the military.But since early 2020, Mr Prayuth's government has been buffeted by youth-led protests triggered by the disqualification of the opposition Future Forward Party (FFP). The protests have since morphed into demands for reform of Thailand's constitution and monarchy, which is revered and protected by strict defamation laws in the country."
157,Milk Tea Alliance: Twitter creates emoji for pro-democracy activists,"Twitter has launched a new emoji for the ""Milk Tea Alliance"" - a movement uniting Asian pro-democracy activists.The alliance has brought together anti-Beijing protesters in Hong Kong and Taiwan with pro-democracy campaigners in Thailand and Myanmar.The emoji, a white cup set against three different shades of a popular regional tea, marks a year since the #MilkTeaAlliance hashtag started.One target is Chinese dominance, and Beijing says it is ""full of biases"".The alliance has united campaigners pushing for greater democracy.It emerged last year from a Twitter dispute between Chinese nationalists and a young Thai actor and his girlfriend, who were accused of supporting democracy in Hong Kong and Taiwanese independence.The movement gained popularity among pro-democracy activists in Thailand who are calling for reform of the monarchy and protesters in Hong Kong who accuse Beijing of harming the territory's democracy.Use of the hashtag spiked again this February after a military coup in Myanmar led to mass protests.""We have seen more than 11 million tweets featuring the #MilkTeaAlliance hashtag over the past year,"" Twitter said in a post on the platform.The emoji will automatically show up when users post the #MilkTeaAlliance hashtag.Twitter said: ""During times of civil unrest or violent crackdowns, it is more important than ever for the public to have access to the #OpenInternet for real-time updates, credible information, and essential services.""The announcement is a big moment for the movement, Netiwit Chotiphatphaisal, a leading Thai activist, told the BBC.""It's very good that Twitter has recognised what we have fought for for many years,"" he said. ""We have to fight not only our dictators but also with Chinese dominance.""""The movement is happening not only online but offline. It's made a big impact.""Prominent activists from the region have celebrated the announcement online. A post on Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong's Twitter account used the emoji, writing: ""Always in solidarity, no matter how hard the times.""Previously, Twitter has created emojis for the #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter movements. The Chinese government has criticised the Milk Tea Alliance.The movement has ""consistently held anti-China positions, and is full of biases against China,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a press conference on Thursday, Bloomberg reported.Why young people are protesting in Thailand'We have no weapons - so I fight with a pen'Although Twitter is banned in mainland China, its officials have used the platform to counter international criticism of Beijing's policies."
158,Moment Thai monk is freed from cave,A Thai monk had to be rescued after being trapped in a flooded cave for four days.
159,Buddhist monk freed from flooded cave in Thailand after four days,"Thai rescue workers have freed a Buddhist monk from a flooded cave, four days after he went inside to meditate.The monk, who was on a pilgrimage, entered the cave in Thailand's Phitsanulok province on Saturday, rescuers say.But an unseasonal rainstorm struck the area on Sunday, causing water levels to rise and flood the cave.A team of 17 divers from a local rescue unit helped to bring the monk out to safety on Wednesday.The monk, Phra Ajarn Manas, 46, makes a pilgrimage to the Phra Sai Ngam cave each year ""to sit in contemplation"", a local rescue unit said in a Facebook post (in Thai).But when he did not return after the heavy rain, residents in the area alerted authorities.Rescuers went in to find him on Tuesday, but had to call off the search due to rising water levels. Thai cave rescue: How the boys were savedMissing Thai boys found alive in cavesThe unit said they had no contact with the monk because there was no phone signal inside the cave and the area could only be accessed by divers. They were concerned he may be ""exhausted or unconscious because of not having food at all"". A team of 17 divers managed to reach the monk on Wednesday morning after the rain stopped.""At 11.30am we successfully rescued Phra Manas from the cave,"" the rescue unit announced on their Facebook page.A video posted by rescuers shows the monk fitted with a diving mask making a 12-metre swim underwater.He was was led out of the cave to safety and received treatment in an ambulance, footage on social media shows.The incident has similarities to the 2018 ordeal of the Wild Boars football team, when 12 boys and their football coach became stuck in a flooded cave in the northern town of Chiang Rai.Thai Navy Seals and an international team of cave divers managed to rescue the boys and their coach from the cave."
160,The Myanmar beauty queen standing up to the military,"Speeches by beauty pageant contestants rarely make headlines.But when Han Lay, Miss Grand Myanmar, spoke out last week against alleged atrocities committed by her country's military, her speech turned heads. ""Today in my country Myanmar ... there are so many people dying,"" she said at the Miss Grand International 2020 event in Thailand. ""Please help Myanmar. We need your urgent international help right now.""A little over a month ago, Han Lay, who is 22, was on the streets of Yangon, Myanmar's largest city, protesting against the military.The unrest in Myanmar began two months ago when the military seized control of the country, undoing a democratic election in which Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party won by a landslide.When tens of thousands of people took to the streets nationwide to protest the coup, the military used water cannon to disperse them. After a week, the response escalated to rubber bullets and then live ammunition.The deadliest day of the conflict came last Saturday, when more than 100 people were killed. A local monitoring group puts the overall death toll at more than 500. According to Save the Children, 43 of those killed were children.Myanmar coup: What is happening and why?'More than 40 children killed' in Myanmar unrestThe 'fallen stars' from Myanmar's deadliest dayHan Lay, a psychology student at the University of Yangon, decided to use the pageant as a platform to speak out about her homeland on an international stage.""In Myanmar, journalists are detained ... so I decided to speak out,"" she told the BBC in a phone interview from Bangkok. She is concerned now that her two-minute speech could have put her on the radar of the military. She said she had decided to stay put in Thailand for at least the next three months.Han Lay said she knew before she left for Thailand that she would be potentially putting herself at risk and would need to stay there for a while.""I am so worried about my family and my security because I spoke out a lot about the military and the situation in Myanmar. In Myanmar everyone knows there are limits on speaking out about what is happening,"" she said.""My friends told me to not come back to Myanmar."" Her fears are not unfounded. Security forces issued arrest warrants last week for 18 celebrities, social media ""influencers"" and two journalists under a law against material ""intended to cause a member of the armed forces to mutiny or disregard their duty"", state media reported. All of them had spoken out against the coup.Han Lay said she had not been contacted by the military or any other officials after her speech, but she said she had been on the receiving end of threatening comments on her social media accounts. ""On social media they threatened me, saying when I go back to Myanmar ... prison is waiting for me,"" she said. She doesn't know who is behind the threatening remarks. The vast majority of social media comments had been supportive, she said.Many of Han Lay's fellow students who she protested with in the first weeks after the coup had been jailed, she said. According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) activist group, at least 2,500 people have been arrested in the military crackdown.And one of her friends was killed, Han Lay said.""He wasn't even protesting. He went to a restaurant to drink some coffee one evening and someone shot him,"" she said. Han Lay's family are safe, she said, but communication with them is sporadic because the internet is being regularly cut in Myanmar. She asked that the BBC did not publish the name of her home town, to protect them.Han Lay's public political remarks, including direct criticism of the Myanmar's military and calls in an interview with fans on the pageant's official channel to ""win the revolution"", are not common among pageant contestants, who often prefer to stay apolitical. Speaking before the competition, Lyv Chili, Miss Grand Cambodia, called on fans to stay out of politics.But Han Lay sees speaking out as her ""duty"", she said. She called Ms Suu Kyi her ""greatest inspiration"". The ousted democratic leader was charged last week with violating Myanmar's official secrets act, a charge which carries a prison term of up to 14 years.Han Lay previously planned on training to be a flight attendant after graduating, but she said she was unsure now about which path to take. Some have tried to persuade her to enter politics, she said, but she doesn't think it's for her.

161,'Karen people fleeing Myanmar told to return',"Thousands of people from the Karen, or Kayin, state of Myanmar have fled to Thailand in recent days following airstrikes by Myanmar's military.But those that have crossed into Thailand are now being told to go home, a spokesperson for the Karen Peace Support Network said.The spokesperson, whose identity is being concealed for security purposes, told BBC World News that people were afraid to return and had been sleeping by a river without any support.""In the morning the Thai military has again come down to the riverbank and told them - you all have to go back to the other side because there is no more fighting,"" the spokesperson said.The UN's envoy to Myanmar, also known as Burma, has previously warned of an ""imminent bloodbath"" as the military crackdown in the country continues.A local monitoring group has said that 536 people have died since February's military coup."
162,AstraZeneca: Thailand delays vaccine rollout over blood clot fears,"Thailand has delayed the rollout of the AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine over reports of blood clots, despite there being no evidence of a link to the jab.The country's prime minister was due to kick off the country's vaccination drive by getting the vaccine on Friday. This has now been cancelled. The delay comes after a number of countries, including Denmark and Norway, suspended the use of the jab.Around 5 million Europeans have already received the AstraZeneca vaccine.Thailand's public health ministry said it made the decision because the country had not been ""hard hit"" by the virus and it had other vaccines it could rely on in the meantime.There have been about 30 cases in Europe of ""thromboembolic events"" - or developing blood clots - after  the vaccine was administered.On Friday, Bulgaria became the latest country to suspend use of the vaccine, and it asked for a written statement from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) accounting for the jab's safety.The EMA said on Thursday that there was no indication the jab was causing the blood clots, adding that its ""benefits continue to outweigh its risks"". AstraZeneca said the drug's safety had been studied extensively in clinical trials.Other countries, including Portugal, Australia, Mexico and the Philippines, have said they are continuing their roll-out.'No indication' Oxford jab linked to blood clots How well does the Oxford vaccine work?""Though the quality of AstraZeneca is good, some countries have asked for a delay,"" Piyasakol Sakolsatayadorn, an adviser for the country's Covid-19 vaccine committee, told reporters at a news conference. ""We will delay [as well]."" However, Thai public health ministry officials clarified that the batch of AstraZeneca vaccines is different from those distributed in Europe, adding that blood clot problems had not been commonly detected amongst Asians. The first batch of 117,300 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines arrived in Thailand on 24 Feb, together with 200,000 doses of China's Coronavac vaccine.More than 30,000 people in Thailand have already received Coronavac since the country kicked off its vaccination programme on 28 February. Thailand says it will continue with its Coronavac rollout. In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said there was no evidence the vaccine had caused problems, and people should still go and get vaccinated when asked to do so. More than 11 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine have now been administered across the UK, according to the MHRA.Portugal has said that the benefits of the jab continued to outweigh any risk it poses to patients, and it would continue to use the vaccine. It said it identified no causal link between receiving the dose and developing blood clots.Australia, which has already been sent 300,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, has been explaining its decision to continue with the AstraZeneca jab.""At the moment the advice very clearly from the doctors is that this is a safe vaccine and we want the rollout to continue. Cool heads need to prevail,"" said Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton. The Philippines health department has also said that there is ""no reason"" to halt the vaccination there.South Korea also appears to be going ahead with its rollout, though some have voiced concerns. Around 785,000 vaccine doses have arrived there already.Authorities in the country recently said that  the deaths of eight people within days of receiving the vaccine had no link to the jab. They later found there was no link between the vaccine and the deaths. However, Denmark, Norway and Iceland have temporarily suspended its rollout.Italy and Austria, meanwhile, have stopped using certain batches of the drug as a precautionary measure.In an earlier statement, the EMA said Denmark's decision was a ""precautionary measure [taken] while a full investigation is ongoing into reports of blood clots in people who received the vaccine, including one case in Denmark where a person died"".The AstraZeneca vaccine, which was developed with the University of Oxford, is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to look more like coronavirus - although it can't cause illness.Once injected, it teaches the body's immune system how to fight the real virus, should it need to."

166,Thai navy rescue four cats from burning ship,"Thai navy sailors have rescued four ginger cats that were abandoned on a burning ship in the Andaman Sea.The human crew had already been evacuated, but the navy soon discovered a few forgotten members when they were sent to check the site for oil spills.A sailor swam out to the capsized boat, before putting the cats on his back to take them to safety.Reportedly, the felines suffered no injuries and are healthy.They are now being cared for by their rescuers at their command post, said Reuters news agency. Missing cat rescued from half-way down chimneyOn Tuesday, the Phamonsin Nava 10 fishing boat had caught fire and started to sink, about 13km (eight miles) off the paradise island of Koh Adang. All eight of the ship's crew members had jumped off the vessel and into the sea, and were rescued by a passing fishing ship, said Thai newspaper The Nation. When the navy was called in to inspect the site, they discovered the cats huddled together on a wooden beam.""I used my camera to zoom in to the boat, and I saw one or two cats popping their heads out,"" said First-Class Petty Officer Wichit Pukdeelon of the navy's air and coastal defence division.A Facebook post on the rescue received more than 2,500 comments on Wednesday praising the crew."
167,Private Thai funeral for man after passport error resolved,"A funeral service has taken place for a man whose body had been stuck at a Thai hospital following a mix-up over passport numbers.The family of David Donoghue, 75, said he faced being placed in a mass cremation on Wednesday over the issue.Stepdaughter Gemma Swift said an agreement to release his body was finally reached between the British Embassy and hospital.It meant a private funeral service and cremation was carried out instead.Ms Swift, from Abergele, Conwy, had previously told BBC Wales of the family's despair after an administrative hitch nearly saw her stepfather's body included in the mass service, which would have left his ashes mingled with those of other people.The mix-up happened when Mr Donoghue had been taken to hospital in Phuket, where he lived for 15 years after retiring to Thailand from his home in Bury, Greater Manchester.He had taken a passport with him to hospital, but it was an old one which had an expired number on it.When his family tried to get his body released to local funeral directors following his death, the paperwork needed from the British Embassy showed his current passport number, and because they did not match the hospital was unable to authorise the release.But following appeals by his family, it was agreed his body could finally be released and a private funeral service at a Buddhist temple and cremation took place on Wednesday.""It was a beautiful service, for a beautiful man and we are glad to have been able to have a funeral service that did his memory justice,"" said Ms Swift.""It was hugely important to us that we could celebrate his life with a funeral in line with his beliefs and return his ashes to his family.""Ms Swift and her family hope to bring Mr Donoghue's ashes back to the UK, and return to Thailand when Covid travel restrictions are lifted to scatter his remains, as he wished."
168,'Passport error' keeps man's body at Thai hospital,"A woman whose stepfather died in Thailand two weeks ago says the hospital there will not release his body in a mix-up over passport numbers.David Donoghue, 75, who retired to Phuket 15 years ago, will join a mass cremation at the hospital on Wednesday if the issue cannot be rectified. Gemma Swift said she was ""pleading"" with embassy staff in Thailand to resolve a ""purely administrative issue""The Foreign Office said staff were trying to obtain the correct paperwork.Mr Donoghue, who lived in Bury in Greater Manchester before emigrating, suffered from the lung disease COPD.He was taken to the Thai hospital by ambulance but had an expired passport with him.Ms Swift, from Abergele, Conwy county, said Mr Donoghue died in hospital on 15 February.However, the paperwork from the British Embassy needed to secure the release of his body to the funeral director showed the number of his current passport.Because the two did not match, his body has remained at the hospital.Swift, 37, said it was something that could easily be corrected and the situation was ""horrendous"" for the family.""The British Embassy over in Bangkok, they said that because [the number] was from his current passport, they were unable to change the letter,"" she told BBC Wales.""They have said that they won't reissue a letter with the passport number that he's got in the hospital with him.""She said the plan was to arrange a funeral for him in Thailand, bring his ashes back to the UK and his the family would later go back to Thailand to scatter his ashes, as he wished.None of the family was able to travel to Thailand to be with Mr Donoghue in his final days, and they have been unable to resolve the bureaucracy issue because of the imposed 14-day Covid quarantine period in Thailand.Ms Swift said she and the rest of the family felt helpless trying to resolve the situation 6,000 miles away. ""I thought this was a basic human right to be able to give somebody a funeral and I accept that there is always going to be red tape...but please just issue a letter and let us bring him home.""She said before Covid-19, family members were regularly travelling to Phuket to visit Mr Donoghue, who previously worked for the Thai tourist police. ""It's been hard knowing that none of us could be at his bedside,"" Ms Swift said.""That on its own was heart breaking, and now to get this two weeks later, to find out we can't give him a funeral, or get his ashes back, it's just horrendous,"" Ms Swift said.""It's like being on autopilot... once we know we have done everything we can, we can start the grieving process, but at the minute we can't.""A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said: ""We are assisting the family of a British man following his death in Thailand and our thoughts are with them at this deeply difficult time. ""Our staff are in contact with the local hospital and funeral director to help his family obtain the necessary paperwork to ensure his body is treated in line with their wishes."""

Children's costumes and toys were also seized.A portfolio found by police during the raid claimed the agency had worked with more than 8,400 child models and actors since 2013, CNA added.Police Col Korrawat Panprapakorn, director-general of the DSI, told reporters that the raid came a year after Australian authorities contacted them.An investigation, named Operation Casting Call, was launched but police only had a single photograph of a child to work with, Col Korrawat said. Painstaking analysis of the image led to the arrest in May last year of a man believed to have taken the picture. He later gave police the address of Nene Modelling Agency, the DSI said.Col Korrawat said the amount of evidence convinced investigators that the agency ""must have been behind the abuse of thousands of children"".Mr Danudetch has been charged with importing pornographic images into a computer system and sexually abusing minors, the Bangkok Post reported."
170,Coronavirus: Bat scientists find new evidence,"Scientists say coronaviruses related to Sars-CoV-2 may be circulating in bats across many parts of Asia.They have discovered a virus that is a close match to the virus that causes Covid-19 in bats at a wildlife sanctuary in eastern Thailand.And they predict that similar coronaviruses may be present in bats across many Asian nations and regions. The discovery extends the area in which related viruses have been found to a distance of 4,800km (2,983 miles).And it gives clues to how Covid-19 might have emerged.The researchers said sampling was limited, but they were confident that coronaviruses ""with a high degree of genetic relatedness to Sars-CoV-2 are widely present in bats across many nations and regions in Asia"".The area includes Japan, China and Thailand, the researchers said in a report published in Nature Communications.Covid: Why bats are not to blame, say scientists The race to find the source of coronavirus in wildlifeCracking the secrets of how bats survive coronavirusesPast studies have suggested that Sars-CoV-2 emerged in an animal, most likely a bat, before spreading to humans.The precise origins of the virus are unknown and have been investigated by a team commissioned by the World Health Organization (WHO).WHO probe team in China exits Wuhan quarantine.In the latest research, a team lead by Lin-Fa Wang of Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore detected a close relative of Sars-CoV-2 in horseshoe bats kept in an artificial cave at a wildlife sanctuary in Thailand.The virus, named RacCS203, is a close match to the genetic code of Sars-CoV-2 (with 91.5% similarity in their genomes). It is also closely related to another coronavirus - called RmYN02 - which is found in bats in Yunnan, China (with 93.6% similarity to the genome of Sars-CoV-2).""We need to do more surveillance in animals,"" said Prof Wang. ""In order to find the true origin, the surveillance work needs to go beyond the border of China.""One big concern is the ability of coronaviruses to move between different mammals, for example cats, dogs and minks.By moving between species, the virus can mutate and evolve into a new pathogen, which could explain how Covid-19 emerged.Dr Thiravat Hemachudha of Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand, was part of the team of international researchers.The viruses found in bats in Thailand and China act as ""a perfect template that can recombine with others and eventually evolve as new emerging pathogen(s), Covid-19 virus as one"", he said.The researchers also examined antibodies in bats and a trafficked pangolin seized in southern Thailand.The antibodies were able to neutralise the pandemic virus, which is further evidence that Sars-CoV-2-related coronaviruses are circulating in Southeast Asia, they said. Commenting, Prof Martin Hibberd of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the findings highlighted the broad distribution of bats and viruses that may include the originator of the current outbreak.  ""Further work is required to understand how Sars-CoV-2 passed from animals to humans, with the recent WHO investigators in Wuhan showing that as of yet, these is no conclusive evidence of how this happened,"" he said.Follow Helen on Twitter."
171,Koh Phangan: Police arrest 89 foreigners in bar raid,"Police on the Thai island of Koh Phangan have arrested 89 foreigners during a raid on a bar that was flouting coronavirus restrictions. Those arrested were from more than 10 countries, including the UK and the US. Thailand is currently under an emergency decree with restrictions on mass gatherings.  The country has recorded 15,465 cases and 76 deaths, far fewer than Western nations. However, cases have been on the rise in recent weeks. There have been 29 cases in Surat Thani province, where Koh Phangan is located, since the pandemic began, but 11 of those have been in the past month. Police raided the Three Sixty Bar on Tuesday night after discovering tickets were being sold online to an event there, local media reports. Images from the raid show a large crowd of people inside the bar, mostly wearing face masks. Police said 22 Thais were also arrested including the bar's owner and another man who admitted to organising the gathering. The bar owner and the organiser were charged with colluding in operating an entertainment venue without permission, while the attendees were charged with violating the emergency decree. The penalty for violating the decree is up to two years in prison and a fine of up to 40,000 baht (£976). The death of the Full Moon PartyThailand hit by worst Covid surge yetKoh Phangan is famous for the Full Moon Party which attracts foreigners from all over the world. At peak times such as New Year, more than 30,000 tourists attend. Tourists have been banned from entering Thailand since last April. Thailand isn't the only nation to punish foreigners for breaking Covid rules. Tourists in Bali, Indonesia, have been captured on film being made to do push-ups by police for failing to wear a mask. Officers have been forcing those who fail to pay a cash fine of 100,000 rupiah (£5.19) to do 50 push-ups if they are not wearing a mask and 15 if they were wearing a mask ""improperly"". "
172,Thai woman jailed for record 43 years for criticising monarchy,"A Thai woman has been jailed for 43 years for criticising the royal family, the country's harshest ever sentence for insulting the monarchy.The former civil servant, known only as Anchan, posted audio clips from a podcast on social media.The 63-year-old said she had simply shared the audio files and had not commented on the content.Thailand's lèse-majesté law, which forbids any insult to the monarchy, is among the strictest in the world.After a three-year break, Thailand revived the controversial law late last year in an attempt to curb months of anti-government protests, with demonstrators demanding changes to the monarchy.How pro-democracy movement gained momentumRisking it all to challenge the monarchyProfile: Thailand's King VajiralongkornAnchan pleaded guilty to 29 separate violations of sharing and posting clips on YouTube and Facebook between 2014 and 2015, her lawyer told the Reuters news agency. She was initially sentenced to 87 years, but this was cut in half because of her guilty plea.Anchan is among a group of 14 people charged with lèse-majesté shortly after a military junta seized power in 2014, vowing to stamp out criticism of the monarchy. The group is accused of uploading podcasts, popular in dissident circles, which questioned official accounts of the monarchy. The author of the podcasts served only two years in jail, and has already been released.The trial was held behind closed doors and the evidence against the defendant kept secret for reasons of national security.That someone accused only of uploading these clips to social media should be given such a harsh sentence, so long after the original arrests, suggests the authorities want to send a warning to other dissidents to stop talking about the monarchy. During a wave of student-led protests last year there was open questioning of the wealth, the political role and personal life of King Vajiralongkorn on a scale never seen in Thailand before. More than 40 mainly young activists have been charged with lèse-majesté over the past few weeks, some multiple times. Until the end of last year the law, which has been condemned by UN human rights officials as excessively severe, had been suspended for a three-year period, at the king's request. That leniency has clearly come to an end.Thailand has a long history of political unrest and protest, but a new wave began in February after a court ordered a fledgling pro-democracy opposition party to dissolve.While protesters had a range of demands relating to the government, things really kicked off when protesters began questioning the powers of the monarchy.Protests included demands to curb recently expanded powers to the monarchy and challenged the king's decision to declare Crown wealth as his personal property, making him by far the wealthiest person in Thailand. It had until now been notionally held in trust for the benefit of the people.There have also been questions over King Vajiralongkorn's decision to take personal command of all military units based in Bangkok - a concentration of military power in royal hands unprecedented in modern Thailand.The move sent shockwaves through a country where people are taught from birth to revere and love the monarchy and fear the consequences of talking about it.The definition of what constitutes an insult to the monarchy in Thailand is unclear and human rights groups say the lèse-majesté law has often been used as a political tool to curb free speech and resist opposition calls for reform and change.Royalists have come out to oppose the student-led demonstrations - and say the protesters want the abolition of the monarchy, something they deny."

One of the ways it has been doing this is by offering extended 90-day tourist visas, which can be renewed twice.  However, anyone entering Thailand must have a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of departure as well as $100,000 worth of insurance that covers treatment of Covid-19.

175,2020 in pictures: The defining moments that changed Asia,"Few years are bound so universally by one event. But 2020 is one of them, synonymous worldwide with the pandemic. Yet there was more to the last 12 months than the coronavirus.We look back at 10 striking moments from Asia that had (almost) nothing to do with Covid-19.This picture of a Muslim man being viciously beaten by a Hindu mob became the defining image of religious riots in Delhi in February.""No one who saw the photo thought I would survive,"" Mohammad Zubair, his head still wrapped in bandages, told the BBC on his return from hospital.The attack, which took place during protests sparked by a new citizenship law, had left him for dead.Yet despite the severity of his injuries, the 37-year-old survived.More than 50 others did not, dying in violence that also drove thousands from their homes. It was the worst communal rioting to hit the Indian capital in decades.But Mr Zubair said he hadn't lost faith in humanity.""People who do such horrible acts cannot be from any religion,"" he said.It was a symbol of hope for a new era of peace. A joint liaison office that allowed the two Koreas to talk directly for the first time since the Korean War. In June it literally went up in smoke.Pyongyang blew up the building, saying it wanted ""human scum and those who have sheltered the scum to pay dearly for their crimes"". That was a reference to defectors in the South, who for years have sent propaganda leaflets into the North, usually by balloon or bottles in rivers.The building itself - launched to great fanfare in 2018 on Pyongyang's side of the militarised border - had been empty since January due to Covid-19. But the dramatic and carefully choreographed explosion still reverberated around the world. It was a clear sign of Pyongyang's fury and, as one analyst put it, marked ""an ominous turning point for the two neighbours"".For many Hong Kongers Jimmy Lai is a hero, a rare tycoon who has dared to challenge the soaring influence of Beijing.That's why the mass raid on his publication Apple Daily - Hong Kong's biggest pro-democracy newspaper - stunned the city.It started with Mr Lai's arrest early on 10 August. The outspoken media mogul was no stranger to arrest. But this time it came under the controversial new national security law imposed by China - where he's viewed as a traitor - that could see the 73-year-old jailed for life.More than 200 police officers searched his paper's headquarters as Mr Lai himself was paraded through the newsroom in unprecedented scenes livestreamed by its reporters.Early the next morning Hong Kongers queued up at news stands across the city to buy the tabloid, which vowed to ""fight on"" in a defiant headline.Earlier this month he was formally charged for endangering national security - led to court in handcuffs and a metal chain. She stepped onto a stage through a cloud of dry ice, to the cheers of thousands of students at one of Thailand's most prestigious universities.But the spectacle of her entry paled in comparison to what she went on to say.In 10 calmly-delivered points Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul laid out an open challenge to the monarchy.By demanding the reform of an institution deemed untouchable - protected from criticism by a draconian lese-majeste law - she transformed the Thai protest movement.""No-one in this world is born with blue blood. Some people may be more more fortunate than others, but no one is born more noble than anyone else,"" said the 21-year-old.Her speech would have gone unnoticed in much of the world - but in Thailand it was electrifying. Just a week earlier fellow activist, Anon Nampa, a human rights lawyer, was the first to break the royal taboo with a speech at a Harry Potter-themed democracy protest.But it was the manifesto read by Ms Panusaya that pushed previously unuttered questions about the Thai king's vast power and wealth to the forefront of the student-led movement.Last month she was one of several dozen young activists charged under the royal insult law - and faces 15 years in jail.It was the last place in the world you'd expect to see a massive pool party. Thousands of revellers crammed into a Wuhan water park, swaying to the beats of an electronic music festival or lounging on rubber floats. No masks, no social distancing.In the city where the coronavirus first emerged months earlier local virus transmissions were down to zero. Life appeared to be returning to normal. Cinemas, museums and parks were re-opening, a far cry from the silent streets emptied by January's original lockdown in Wuhan, which back then was an unprecedented sight.Yet onlookers watched the packed pool with a mixture of awe and alarm, especially in those countries where the virus still raged.China, which has largely brought Covid-19 under control unlike many parts of the western world, used the opportunity to make a point.The pool party sends a message to the world, said the Beijing mouthpiece, The Global Times, that ""strict anti-virus measures have a payback"".A young mother knelt before the body of her newborn to say her final goodbye - handcuffed and covered from head to toe in personal protective gear.This image of Reina Mae Nasino - a political detainee released from prison under armed guard to attend her baby's funeral - agonised Filipinos.It was the tragic end of an unsuccessful campaign to reunite the 23-year-old with her daughter.Baby River was born in custody, separated from her mother at just over one-month-old - despite multiple pleas and legal challenges to keep the pair together. Her health deteriorated soon after, but even when she was hospitalised Ms Nasino was not permitted to see her baby.The next time she saw River was at her wake - the three-month-old baby died of pneumonia in October.The case has raised critical questions about the rights of Filipino mothers in custody and sparked widespread outrage - with many saying the system had failed both Ms Nasino and her child.  This image of a Komodo dragon faced with a construction truck went viral in October.It sparked a slew of concerns about the impact of a new tourist attraction dubbed ""Jurassic Park"", which is being built on a remote and undeveloped Indonesian island.The site is one of a handful of Indonesian islands where the famed dragons - the world's largest lizards - are thought to have roamed for millions of years.""This is the first time Komodos are hearing the roar of engines and the smell of smoke,"" wrote an activist that shared the photo. ""Does anyone still care about conservation?""The Indonesian government moved to reassure the public that no dragons would be harmed as part of their push to boost tourism on the island. But some environmentalists remain concerned about the changes being made to the dragons' ancient habitat.Earlier this month local media reported that a construction worker was rushed to hospital by speedboat after a lizard bit him on the leg and hand, leaving him ""seriously injured"".It was time to strike a pose and celebrate. On 30 October, for the first time ever, same-sex couples took part in a mass military wedding in Taiwan.The historic moment came a year after the island legalised gay marriage - the only place in Asia to do so.""We are hoping that more LGBT people in the military can bravely stand up, because our military is very open-minded. In matters of love, everyone will be treated equally,"" Chen Ying-hsuan, an army lieutenant who married Li Li-chen, told the Associated Press news agency.They were one of two lesbian couples to tie the knot as part of a military ceremony that wed 188 couples in total.Major Wang Yi and her wife Meng You-mei were the other pair, carrying a pride flag each throughout the ceremony.Ms Meng's parents did not attend, but both Ms Wang's parents and her teacher came in support of the couple.""I really feel this is a huge breakthrough for the military,"" Ms Wang's mother told AP. ""Perhaps for heterosexual couples, it's just a [piece of] paper, but it's very important for gay couples.""Thailand's youth-led democracy movement has become known for its creativity.Few protest markers have been more surreal or colourful than the inflatable yellow rubber ducks that first appeared on Bangkok's streets in November.They were only supposed to be a bit of fun, one activist told Reuters news agency. But their debut at a rally outside the Thai parliament happened to coincide with the worst violence seen in the demonstrations since this latest wave began in July.When police fired water cannons at protesters on 17 November they responded by deploying the ducks as impromptu shields.The waterfowls proved more effective than umbrellas, noted one observer.Thailand's young activists have been visibly inspired by their counterparts in Hong Kong who famously used umbrellas as a defence against water cannons.But they've also been developing their own symbols and strategies.At the rally the next day the ducks were out in force. They had fast acquired mascot status and have been spotted at several protests since.This photograph of a paramilitary policeman swinging his baton at an elderly and unarmed Sikh farmer has triggered huge debate in India.It went viral on social media as hundreds of thousands of farmers staged angry demonstrations outside New Delhi against new agricultural laws.It soon found itself at the heart of a political tussle too.Opposition politicians highlighted the image to criticise the treatment of protesters, while the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) claimed - falsely - that the farmer was not hit.It wasn't long before Indian media tracked down Sukhdev Singh, the farmer pictured, who told them he had suffered multiple blows to his arms, back and calves.A tweet trying to discredit the photo by the BJP's social media chief was later called out on Twitter - in what local press say was a first in India - as ""manipulated media"".All images copyright."
176,Thai man revives baby elephant with CPR after motorbike accident,"A baby elephant struck by a motorbike while crossing a road in Thailand survived after it was revived by an off-duty rescue worker. Mana Srivate told Reuters news agency he had performed dozens of resuscitation attempts in his career - but never before on an elephant.In a video that went viral online he is seen giving two-handed compressions to the elephant lying on its side in the middle of a dark road.The elephant stood up after 10 minutes.It had been trying to cross a road with a group of wild pachyderms in the eastern Thai province of Chanthaburi.In the video, Mr Mana's colleagues are also seen treating the motorcycle rider, who survived the crash without serious injuries.Mr Mana, who has been a rescue worker for 26 years, told Reuters he came across the accident scene late on Sunday while he was off duty on a road trip.""It's my instinct to save lives, but I was worried the whole time because I can hear the mother and other elephants calling for the baby,"" Mr Mana told the agency by phone.""I assumed where an elephant heart would be located based on human theory and a video clip I saw online.""When the baby elephant starting to move, I almost cried,"" he said. The baby elephant stood up after about 10 minutes and was taken to another site for treatment, reported Reuters, before it was returned to the accident site in the hope of finding its mother. It has escaped serious injuries too.The other elephants returned when the mother heard her baby calling out, Mr Mana told the agency.He added that the elephant was the only victim he had ever managed to revive through cardiopulmonary resuscitation."

178,Covid-19: Thailand tests thousands after virus outbreak in seafood market,"After months of avoiding the surge in cases seen by its neighbours, Thailand has been hit by its worst Covid-19 outbreak yet.Tens of thousands of people are being tested after hundreds of cases linked to its biggest seafood market. It has locked down Samut Sakhon, the coastal province near the capital Bangkok, home to the market which employs mostly migrant workers from neighbouring Myanmar.Workers have been ordered to stay home.Thailand was the first country outside China to register cases of Covid-19. But it has recorded a relatively low virus caseload since, with just over 4,000 cases and 60 deaths before this latest outbreak.It started with a 67-year-old Thai female prawn seller testing positive on Thursday.Her case at Mahachai market - the heart of Thailand's multi-billion-dollar seafood industry - set the mass testing in motion.Four cases were reported the next day and by Sunday that number had jumped to 689 - most of them Myanmar migrants, the public health ministry said. It added that the woman had no history of leaving the country and authorities were searching for the source of the infection.Along with stepping up testing, Myanmar workers who live around the market have been ordered not to leave their residences, according to AFP news agency.""We are locking and banning them from moving,"" the health ministry's permanent secretary Kietphgum Wongit said, adding that the workers were being provided with food and water.Lines of migrant workers - mostly from Myanmar - were seen waiting for their coronavirus swab in the market on Sunday, alongside some Thais.Health officials said most of the cases identified so far have been asymptomatic, reported Reuters news agency.A further 360 migrant workers tested positive on Monday - the largest daily infection numbers for Covid-19 ever recorded in Thailand. Taweesin Visanuyothin, a spokesman for Thailand's Covid-19 taskforce, said authorities would also be conducting ""active tracing in several communities of about 10,300 people"", AFP said.Samut Sakhon will stay under lockdown and night-time curfew until 3 January.Authorities have said up to 40,000 people will be tested there and in nearby provinces.Thailand had largely appeared to have kept Covid-19 in check, recording a low death toll for a nation of 70 million people that shares porous borders with four countries, including Myanmar.""We will have to cut the epidemic cycle quickly. We already have experience in handling it,"" Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha posted on his Facebook account over the weekend.A Myanmar worker who has helped coordinate testing in Samut Sakhon told AFP that anti-migrant sentiment had been shared on social media - with Thais accusing the workers of importing Covid-19.In Myanmar the nation's already fragile healthcare system has been overwhelmed by a spike in coronavirus cases after a big second wave hit the country in mid-August - with daily cases rising above 1,000 in recent months. Authorities in Bangkok have urged people to intensify preventative measures against the coronavirus by avoiding gatherings and observing social distancing. They have also asked public and private sector organisations to cancel their annual new year countdown parties.The latest outbreak comes as Thailand attempts to revive a tourist industry hit hard by the pandemic. On Thursday it had eased restrictions to permit more foreigners to visit the kingdom."

182,Thailand: Rare whale skeleton discovered,"An almost perfectly preserved whale skeleton thought to be between 3,000 and 5,000 years old has been discovered in Thailand. The bones were found in early November some 12km (7.5 miles) from the coast just to the west of Bangkok.The 12m (39ft) long skeleton is thought to be that of a Bryde's whale.Experts hope the find might provide ""a window into the past,"" especially for research on sea levels and biodiversity.The partially fossilised bones are ""a rare find,"" mammal researcher Marcus Chua of the National University of Singapore told the BBC. ""There are few whale subfossils in Asia,"" he said, and even fewer ones are ""in such good condition"".Pictures shared by Thailand's environment minister Varawut Silpa-archa show the bones apparently almost entirely intact.According to the politician, more than 80% of the skeleton has so far been recovered, including vertebrae, ribs, fins and one shoulder blade. The skeleton's head alone is estimated to be about 3m in length. Mr Chua says the discovery will allow researchers to find out more about the particular species in the past, whether there were any differences compared to today's Bryde's whales. The skeleton will also provide information about the ""paleobiological and geological conditions at that time, including sea level estimation, types of sediments, and the contemporary biological communities at that time"". Ancient four-legged whale fossil foundRare dinosaur bones 'belong to different species'Scientists unearth skull of human ancestor 'cousin'""So this find provides a window into the past once the skeleton has been dated,"" Mr Chua says. The bones are yet to be carbon-dated to determine their exact age, with the results expected in December.The gulf of Thailand has an interesting history in the last 10,000 years, the biologist points out, with sea levels possibly up to 4m higher than today and active tectonic activity. The skeleton was found off the current coastline in Samut Sakhon. Bryde's whales, which live worldwide in warm temperate and tropical waters, are still found in the waters around Thailand today.You may be interested in watching:"

184,Thailand's 'largest ketamine bust' turns out to be cleaning agent,"Thailand's claim to have seized almost $1bn worth of the drug ketamine has turned out to be a ""misunderstanding"", its justice minister has said. Instead, lab tests found the substance was trisodium phosphate - a compound commonly used as a cleaning agent. Somsak Thepsuthin said a ""technical error"" in field testing had led to the initial false claim.Officials had seized the substance earlier this month, and declared it to be Thailand's largest ketamine seizure.Ketamine is widely used as an anaesthetic, but due to its hallucinogenic effects is also thought of as a ""party drug"".  It can cause serious harm to the body and be fatal if used this way. Trisodium phosphate, a white powdered substance, can be used in stain remover, or even as a food additive. Car with hidden drugs sold at police auctionThe drug addictions devastating Thai villages""This was a misunderstanding that our agency must accept,"" Mr Somsak told reporters, adding that there was a ""technical error in the field"", according to a Bangkok Post report. He explained that the mix up had occurred because preliminary tests, which turn purple in the presence of ketamine hydrochloride, react the same to trisodium phosphate.But when tested again later in a proper laboratory by the Office of the Narcotics Control Board (ONCB), at least 66 sacks were confirmed to be the cleaning agent, said the Bangkok Post. According to Reuters, there were 475 bags of the substance altogether that were found. On 12 November, Thailand seized nearly 11.5 tonnes of white powder from a local warehouse after a tip-off from Taiwan. ""The drugs are the largest amount ever seized in Thailand, with [an] estimated value [of] 28.7bn baht ($950m; £710m) based on retail price,"" Wichai Chaimongkhol, ONCB secretary-general, told reporters after the bust, according to a report by The Nation.Mr Somsak later admitted that it ""might have been premature to hold a press conference"" at such an early stage, said the Post."
185,Thailand revives law banning criticism of king in bid to curb protests,"Thailand has revived a controversial law against criticising the royal family in an attempt to curb months of anti-government protests.Several activists have been summoned to face charges under the lèse-majesté law, which carries a sentence of up to 15 years in prison for each count.It is the first time in over two years that such charges have been filed.Thailand has been rocked by student-led protests for months, with demonstrators demanding changes to the monarchy.Protesters are also calling for constitutional reforms and the removal of the country's prime minister. How pro-democracy movement gained momentumRisking it all to challenge the monarchyProfile: Thailand's King VajiralongkornOn Tuesday, a prominent student activist, 22-year-old Parit Chiwarak, said he had received a summons for lèse-majesté - among other charges - but that he was ""not afraid"".""The ceiling has been broken. Nothing can contain us anymore,"" he tweeted, along with a photo of the summons.At least six other key protest leaders, including human rights lawyer Anon Nampa and Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul, are expected to face the same charges, according to reports. The most feared law in Thailand is back in use, after a three-year break, reportedly ordered by King Vajiralongkorn.Its revival follows increasingly outspoken criticism of the king by protesters, in chants, on stage, and in what for many Thais is shockingly vulgar graffiti. This is something very new in Thailand. Even in previous episodes of political unrest few dared to attack the monarchy. But this generation of activists insists that the spending and power of the king must be challenged. They will now face a law which allows secret trials, and puts huge pressure on defendants to admit guilt to reduce the often draconian prison sentences. But it may prove less effective in suppressing anti-monarchy sentiment than in the past, now that scandalous reports about the royal family are circulated instantly on social media. Its use may even be counterproductive, costing the Thai monarchy sympathy while it is engaged in a campaign to shore up support for the institution.Thailand's lèse-majesté law, which forbids any insult to the monarchy, is among the strictest in the world.The reintroduction of charges under the lèse-majesté law comes ahead of a planned demonstration on Wednesday at the Crown Property Bureau, an institution that controls the royal fortune on behalf of the monarchy, located in the capital, Bangkok. This latest development follows increasingly outspoken criticism of the king by protesters. King Vajiralongkorn has been criticised for spending much of his time in Germany. Protests have included demands to curb recently expanded powers to the monarchy and have challenged the king's decision to declare Crown wealth as his personal property, making him by far the wealthiest person in Thailand. It had until now been notionally held in trust for the benefit of the people.There have also been questions over King Vajiralongkorn's decision to take personal command of all military units based in Bangkok - a concentration of military power in royal hands unprecedented in modern Thailand.Last week, at least 41 people were injured after clashes between protesters and police in the Thai capital, Bangkok. Protesters were attempting to reach parliament, where lawmakers were debating possible changes to the constitution.They hurled smoke bombs and bags of paint at police, who retaliated with water cannon and tear-gas solution.Thailand has a long history of political unrest and protest, but a new wave began in February after a court ordered a fledgling pro-democracy opposition party to dissolve.Protests were re-energised in June when prominent pro-democracy activist Wanchalearm Satsaksit went missing in Cambodia, where he had been in exile since the 2014 military coup. There were reports that he had been grabbed off the street and bundled off into a vehicle. Protesters accused the Thai state of orchestrating his kidnapping - a charge police and government officials have denied.But things really kicked off when protesters began questioning the powers of the monarchy.The move sent shockwaves through a country where people are taught from birth to revere and love the monarchy and fear the consequences of talking about it.The definition of what constitutes an insult to the monarchy in Thailand is unclear and human rights groups say the lèse-majesté law has often been used as a political tool to curb free speech and resist opposition calls for reform and change.Royalists have come out to oppose the student-led demonstrations - and say the protesters want the abolition of the monarchy, something they deny."
186,Thailand protesters drench police headquarters with paint,"Thousands of protesters in Thailand converged on the police headquarters in Bangkok on Wednesday night, defacing the building a day after violent protests left dozens injured.Angered by the government's decision to reject a constitutional reform proposal - a key demand of protesters - and alleged police violence, demonstrators hurled buckets of colourful paint and sprayed graffiti on the Royal Thai Police headquarters' building facade.Police barricaded themselves inside the station and did not intervene. Thailand has been rocked by student-led protests for months, with protesters demanding constitutional reforms, the removal of the country's prime minister and changes to the monarchy. On Tuesday, Thailand experienced its most violent protests in months as protesters clashed with police officials.At least 40 people were injured as protesters hurled smoke bombs and bags of paint at police, who retaliated with water cannon and tear-gas solution. Protesters had been attempting to reach the country's parliament where lawmakers were debating possible changes to the constitution, including a controversial proposal by civil group the Internet Dialogue on Law Reform (iLaw) which many protesters supported. Their proposal called for a more transparent and democratic government, and reforms that would ensure only an elected MP could become prime minister. Thailand currently has a system where its parliament can nominate a non-elected person as PM.Why Thai protesters are willing to break the law Dozens injured as violent protests rock Bangkok'My father is blinded by love for the monarchy'On Wednesday evening, that proposal was rejected, prompting renewed protests.""We came here solely because of our anger,"" one of the protest leaders, Panusaya ""Rung"" Sithijirawattanakul, told news agency Reuters.Protesters threw glass bottles over the walls of the police headquarters, which was barricaded with concrete blocks and razor wire. Others sprayed anti-royal slogans on walls, and defaced a pedestal which bore a picture of Thailand's Queen Mother Sirikit, though her portrait was left untouched. Giant inflatable rubber ducks also made an appearance - they first popped up on Tuesday and were used as shields against water cannon.By Thursday morning, the police headquarters had been painted white, leaving few traces of the previous night's demonstration.But the protesters have already vowed to return, with another rally scheduled for next week.All images copyright.You may also be interested in: "

188,Thailand protests: More than 40 injured as clashes rock Bangkok,"At least 41 people were left injured after clashes between protesters and police in the Thai capital, Bangkok.Protesters were attempting to reach parliament on Tuesday, where lawmakers were debating possible changes to the constitution. They hurled smoke bombs and bags of paint at police, who retaliated with water cannon and tear-gas solution. The proposed constitutional changes have been one of the core demands of the months-long protest movement. Others included reforms to the monarchy and the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha - a former general who seized power in a 2014 coup.But the BBC's Jonathan Head, who was at the scene, said many activists were worried that parliament would dismiss most of their demands - in particular, the one calling for reform of the monarchy. Legislators are expected to vote on whether to accept any of the proposed changes by Wednesday evening local time. The reforms that the protesters are calling for could make Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn more accountable and also reform the senate, where the members are unelected.Tuesday's protest is said to be the most violent since the student-led movement emerged in July. It started when a group of demonstrators tried to cut through razor-wire barricades near parliament. They hurled smoke bombs and bags of paint at lines of riot police.In response, police used a water cannon to try to force them back and when that failed, they used the cannon to fire a liquid laced with a tear-gas solution.Demonstrators could be seen trying to wash the irritant from their eyes. Health officials said five people had been treated in hospital for the effects of tear gas, while others were treated at the scene.Some protesters suffered gunshot wounds, though police denied using live rounds or rubber bullets during the operation, according to news agencies AFP and Reuters. Some protesters tried to shelter behind giant inflatable rubber ducks, which they had intended to float down the river behind parliament as lawmakers debated inside.Amid the chaos, anti-government protesters then clashed with pro-monarchy supporters, with the rival groups hurling objects at each other.

India is the world's biggest market for motorbike sales, followed by Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam.Motorbikes are the easiest way to navigate the region's often congested roads, particularly in its big cities.Sales for Royal Enfield, which only makes motorbikes in the mid-segment market (250-750cc class), have grown 88% across the region in the last year.However, not all motorbike brands have been successful in Asia. US-based Harley-Davidson recently announced its withdrawal from India, in stark contrast to Royal Enfield's expansion.""Products of Harley-Davidson were considered oversized for India. The infrastructure, top speeds and traffic discipline is not very suited to cruising at high speeds safely,"" says Vivek Vaidya, a transport expert at consultants Frost & Sullivan.""They tried lower engine sizes but that wasn't their forte.

They are also demanding curbs on the king's powers - a call that has led to unprecedented public discussion of an institution shielded from criticism by law.A statement published in the official Royal Gazette on Thursday said the emergency measures announced last week would end from noon local time (05:00 GMT).""It appears that the serious situation that led to the state of emergency declaration has subsided and ended. The circumstances can now be controlled by state officers,"" the statement said.Last week, authorities citied the proximity of protesters to Queen Suthida's convoy as a reason for the decree. Some activists had jeered and held up their trademark three-finger salute - borrowed from the Hunger Games movie - at her passing motorcade in Bangkok.The latest government move comes a day after protesters marched to Government House in Bangkok and gave Mr Prayuth a three-day deadline to step down or face more demonstrations.The prime minister has refused to resign. In an televised address on Wednesday he said discussions should be held in parliament. ""I will make the first move to de-escalate this situation,"" said Mr Prayuth as he announced he was ready to lift the decree. ""I ask the protesters to reciprocate with sincerity, to turn down the volume on hateful and divisive talk.""An extraordinary parliamentary sitting has now been announced for Monday.After the decree was ordered, Thai authorities arrested dozens of activists - including key protest leaders. They also ordered investigations into a number of news outlets, suspended the online platforms of Voice TV, a local broadcaster, over its coverage of the protests and ordered internet providers to block Telegram, a private messaging app that protesters have used to organise rallies.But the escalating crackdown failed to stem the protests. Activists ignored the protest ban and have rallied in the tens of thousands in the days since, demanding the release of those in prison.At a large demonstration in Bangkok last Friday, police used major force for the first time in this renewed wave of protest, deploying water cannons and tear gas to break up the rallies. Protesters have responded by employing fresh tactics, including flash mobs and calls for everyone to be a leader to avoid arrest.Despite Thursday's developments, protest leaders vowed to keep up the pressure on Thailand's leaders.Patsaravalee Tanakitvibulpon, who was arrested on Wednesday and later released on bail, told reporters that Mr Prayuth ""doesn't have any legitimacy left to be prime minister"".""For the past six years he did nothing to benefit the people,"" said Ms Patsaravalee, also known as ""Mind"". ""Prayuth Chan-ocha doesn't have any trustworthiness left for us. Therefore, he must resign, along with his entire cabinet.""Fellow protest leader Sirawith Seritiwat said Mr Prayuth was trying to stay in power while ignoring the people's demands. ""The emergency decree shouldn't have been issued in the first place,"" he added."
195,Thailand protest: Why young activists are embracing Hong Kong's tactics,"Thai democracy activists are increasingly adopting tactics used by their counterparts in Hong Kong, as they defy a ban on gatherings after months of mounting protests targeting the prime minister and king.When demonstrators in Bangkok held up umbrellas to shield themselves from tear gas fired for the first time last Friday, it was strikingly reminiscent of the anti-government protests that shook the Chinese territory last year.From helmets and gas masks to flashmobs and hand signals, Thailand’s student-led movement is drawing on the experience of Hong Kong’s young activists in its own fight for change.Here are three echoes of the Hong Kong protests in Thailand.After the arrest of many of Thailand’s protest leaders last week, activists have changed tack.“They think arresting the leaders will stop us,” Pla, a 24-year-old demonstrator, told thousands of protesters at Bangkok’s Victory Monument on Sunday. “It’s no use. We are all leaders today.”The absence of a centralised leadership was a defining feature of the seven straight months of protests that rocked Hong Kong - and what many say sustained the movement for so long.While there were figureheads, decision-making was devolved with protesters commonly using online forums and the secure messaging app Telegram to organise - and gather in large numbers quickly.In Thailand the use of Telegram has skyrocketed in recent days. Protesters have used it to co-ordinate rallies since the government ban on political gatherings of more than four people was implemented last week. Why Thai protesters are willing to break the law 'My father is blinded by his love for the monarchy'A group started by Free Youth, a key protest collective, reached the maximum 200,000 subscribers soon after it launched. Thai authorities have responded by ordering internet providers to block the app.While many Thais are joining Telegram as non-protesting observers, active members use the groups to strategise - from where protests should take place to updates on police whereabouts. Like the Hong Kong protesters, Thai activists have been putting decisions to a vote. On Monday the main Free Youth Facebook page asked supporters if they should take a break by hitting the “care” emoticon to pick a rest and the “wow” emoticon to protest. They decided to keep going. Thai protesters are now trying to ""remain as flat as possible, making leadership open and replaceable"", says Aim Sinpeng, a political scientist at the University of Sydney. ""This is very different from past protests in Thailand that tended to be personalised around leaders who are often influential people.""The use of the hashtag #everybodyisaleader has been growing on social media in recent days, an attempt to ""re-pivot the movement... to protect itself from state persecution"", says Dr Aim, whose research focuses on digital politics in South East Asia. Over the weekend a new language evolved on the streets of Bangkok. The building blocks were borrowed from Hong Kong.To signal they needed helmets, activists raised their hands in a triangle above their heads. By crossing their fingers they showed someone was injured. Swirling an index finger in an anti-clockwise direction was a warning to disperse.The savvy use of hand signals was first observed in Hong Kong where they became indispensable for protesters communicating across huge crowds. Thai activists have incorporated this language of signs as well as sprouting homegrown signals shared through infographics on social media.Since their loudspeakers were confiscated activists have also resorted to other innovative communication methods, says Wasana Wongsurawat, an associate professor of history at Chulalongkorn University.At a protest in Bangkok on Saturday she watched activists deploy what she describes as “a jungle telephone” to signal police arrivals or request equipment such as umbrellas for those on the protest frontlines.“Someone would shout ‘the water canons are coming’. Then people in the crowd started repeating the phrase. Within two minutes the message travelled from one end of the demonstration to the other,” Dr Wasana tells the BBC, adding the rally disbanded before the suspected equipment arrived.While the Thai and Hong Kong protests are both rooted in unique local grievances, their activists see commonalities in their situations.The students risking it all to challenge the monarchyWho is General Prayuth Chan-ocha?In Thailand demonstrators are demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former coup leader who became premier last year after disputed elections. They are also urging reform of the country’s powerful monarchy, an unprecedented challenge to an institution shielded from criticism by law.In Hong Kong, activists have also sought the resignation of their leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, as they demand universal suffrage and protest against the rising influence of Beijing in the semi-autonomous territory’s affairs.In both places democracy campaigners have come to see their political struggles as shared in a new era of protests.Earlier this year they dubbed themselves the Milk Tea Alliance - a loose online coalition of activists from Thailand, Hong Kong and Taiwan - referring to the classic drink popular in all three places. The Milk Tea Alliance and other creative protest methodsThai protest leaders have often said the Hong Kong movement has inspired them. And Hong Kong activists have expressed their solidarity, offering tips on protective protest wear, internet security and first aid.Prominent Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong regularly tweets in support of the Thai movement with the hashtag #StandWithThailand. Last week he wrote: “People should not be afraid of their governments. Only governments should be afraid of their people.”The new generation of protesters in Thailand and Hong Kong have stood out both for their youth and also their skill at harnessing modern technology.“The culture of protest in Thailand in 2020 is the culture of protest of internet natives,” says Dr Wasana, pointing to how adept the activists are at spreading their messages on social media.By borrowing from the Hong Kong playbook activists hope to sustain their movement. ""There's no other example of high school and college kids fighting water cannons and tear gas for such a long period of time,"" the historian adds.The whole nature of protest is shifting across South East Asia, says Bridget Welsh, an honorary research associate at the University of Nottingham in Malaysia. Democracy activists in Thailand and Hong Kong, as well as countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia, are ""adapting to growing authoritarianism in a globalised world"" with fast-changing tactics that harness the power of technology and visual representation.Additional reporting by Thanyarat Doksone and Grace Tsoi"
196,Thailand protests: Authorities move to ban Telegram messaging app,"Thai authorities are reported to have ordered internet providers to block the Telegram messaging app, which has been used by anti-government protesters.A leaked document outlining the plans was shared on social media.Police also threatened to shut four news outlets for violating a decree issued last week to end the rallies.Pro-democracy activists have held months of protests calling for the resignation of the prime minister and curbs on the powers of the monarchy.Members of the student-led movement have gathered in defiance of an order banning protests and want Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha - a former army chief who seized power in a 2014 coup - to resign. Their demands for reform have since grown to include questioning the role of the monarchy, an institution long seen as sacred in Thailand.Authorities have failed to curb the rallies since they issued an emergency order on Thursday, with protesters still gathering daily, largely peacefully, in Bangkok and other parts of the country.At least 80 people have been arrested since Tuesday. Those detained risk long sentences if they are found to have breached Thailand's strict lese majeste laws, which ban criticism of the monarchy. Anyone found breaking the law could be jailed for up to 15 years. Why is Thailand trying to ban Telegram?The government's plan to block Telegram was reported by local media on Monday after a document marked ""very confidential"" was leaked and shared widely on social media. Telegram is a popular secure messaging app that has been used by activists to organise protests at short notice. The document - apparently produced by Thailand's digital economy ministry, which has the power to censor the internet in Thailand - was sent to the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission. The student daring to challenge Thailand’s monarchyWhy Thai protesters are willing to break the law 'My father is blinded by love for the monarchy'""The Ministry of Digital Economy and Society is seeking your co-operation to inform the Internet Service Providers and all mobile network operators to suspend the use of Telegram app,"" it said.Separately, police told reporters they had instructed the digital ministry to restrict Free Youth's group on Telegram. The group has played a key role in organising protests in recent months.It is unclear how effective the order will be in curtailing the democracy movement. In a separate order, Thai police said they were investigating four well-known news organisations over their live-reporting of the protests. Prachatai, Voice TV, The Reporters and The Standard have reported extensively from the protest sites.Thailand has a long history of political unrest and protest but a new wave began in February after a popular opposition political party was ordered to dissolve. The order followed elections in March last year - the first since the military seized power in 2014 and the first chance to vote for many young people and first-time voters. The elections were seen as an opportunity for change after years of military rule.

The pro-democracy Future Forward Party (FFP), with its charismatic leader Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, garnered the third-largest share of seats and was particularly popular with young, first-time voters. But in February a court ruled the FFP had received a loan from Mr Thanathorn which was deemed a donation - making it illegal - and the party was forced to disband, prompting thousands of young Thais to join street protests.The protests were halted by Covid-19 restrictions, which banned gatherings, but they began again in June when a prominent pro-democracy activist went missing.Wanchalearm Satsaksit, who had been living in Cambodia in exile since 2014, was reportedly grabbed off the street and bundled off into a vehicle. Protesters accused the Thai state of orchestrating his kidnapping - a charge police and government officials have denied.The satirist who vanished in broad daylight In recent months, the protesters have challenged the king's decision to declare Crown wealth as his personal property, which made him by far the wealthiest person in Thailand. It had until now been notionally held in trust for the benefit of the people.There have also been questions over the king's decision to take personal command of all military units based in Bangkok - a concentration of military power in royal hands unprecedented in modern Thailand."
197,Thailand protests: 'My father is blinded by his love for the monarchy',"""My father taught me that criticising our king was a sin. A taboo.""But Danai, 19, is now defying his father's warning. A law student in Bangkok, he is one of tens of thousands of protesters who have packed the streets of the Thai capital every month this summer, demanding reform of the monarchy. His father Pakorn is a well-travelled, upper middle class man. His name and his son's name have been changed to protect their identity. Although they don't live in the same house, they still see each other often. But every time they meet, they avoid speaking about one subject: the monarchy.  ""If we talk about it we'll have a row and it will ruin our day,"" Danai says. ""Once we had an argument in our car after I criticised the king. For my father the king is untouchable. I asked, why? He said that I am too young to understand. He got very angry, then he went quiet and wouldn't speak to me.""Danai's family isn't alone. Disagreements like this over the role of an institution with sacrosanct status in Thailand is playing out in homes - in cities and in the countryside - around the country.But families in Thailand don't just argue about the monarchy face-to-face, many decide to have it out on social media.And things can get pretty extreme. When a university student in the northern city of Chiang Mai revealed on Facebook in September that her father wanted to sue her because of her anti-monarchy views, he responded by posting that she was no longer allowed to use his family name. Pakorn believes that university teachers are responsible for his son's behaviour.""In Thai society there are groups of hard-core people who are anti-royalists. Also the internet and social media keep pouring out misleading information and fake news. Young people absorb quickly without filtering,"" he says. Danai challenged his father about the monarchy for the first time when he was 17. ""We were at the cinema. Before the film started, when the royal anthem was played as usual, everyone stood up to pay respect to the king. I didn't want to do that, so I stayed in my seat. My father forced me to get up, but I resisted. Only when people started staring at us, did I finally stand.""Refusing to stand when the royal anthem was playing used to be illegal in Thailand, until the law was repealed in 2010. But failing to do so is still seen by many as disrespecting the monarchy. Thais are taught from birth to revere and love their king, but also to fear the consequences of speaking out against him. The so-called Land of Smiles is one of a very small number of countries with a lese majeste law. This means that criticising the king, the queen or the heir to the throne is illegal - and anyone doing so could be jailed for up to 15 years. Today, Danai doesn't stand up in the cinema any more. Since July, thousands of university students have taken to the streets, and have continued to do so despite a state of emergency in recent days and the arrest of many of the protest leaders. The student daring to challenge Thailand’s monarchyWhy Thai protesters are willing to break the law The satirist who vanished in broad daylight Thailand blocks Change.org for petition against kingThey are demanding curbs on the king's nearly unlimited powers and finances. These requests may seem tame to people in other parts of the world, but in Thailand no one has publicly challenged the monarchy in modern history. The student protests shocked most Thais - including Danai's father, Pakorn.   ""I was born in the reign of King Rama IX. He did more for his people than for his own children. When he was ill, I was ready to leave this world if that could have made him live longer. But Generation Z, like my son, don't have that experience.""This clash of generations would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. But the crowning of the new monarch, King Maha Vajiralongkorn, changed everything.The new king is rarely seen in public, and spends most of his time in Germany - even more so since Thailand was hit by the coronavirus pandemic. There have been questions over his decision to take personal command of all military units based in Bangkok - a concentration of military power in royal hands unprecedented in modern Thailand. His private life is also much talked about. Divorced three times, he married last year for a fourth time. He also appointed a woman who'd been his bodyguard as his official consort, before disowning and then reinstating her. By contrast, the late King Rama IX was seen by many as semi-divine. Everywhere he went people would lie before him and call themselves ""the dust under his feet"". Pakorn saw the late king in person twice. ""One time, I was in my car and I saw him driving by himself, coming in the opposite direction. There was no motorcade, no sirens. Our eyes met. I was shocked. I think he just wanted to do things like other people, easy and informal. I felt he had an aura around him, his presence was very special.""However during the last 10 years of Rama IX's life, he was ill and stayed in hospital most of the time. Young Thais like Danai rarely saw him in public. Even so, when the king died Danai posted messages on Facebook showing his sadness and gratitude toward him. He told the BBC  he now regrets doing that.""I've just realised that what I was told about him at the time or before that was all propaganda."" Danai can't understand his father's feelings for the king. ""He is blinded by his love for the monarchy. Talking to him is like talking to a wall. He doesn't want to listen. For now, the only thing I want from my father is for him to be open-minded about this subject, as he normally is with any another issue."" Danai believes his mother is also a royalist but does not support the monarchy as much as his dad. She doesn't ever criticise the monarchy however - and she thinks the protests will fail.""My mum thinks that reforming the monarchy is something out of reach and protesters can't make this happen,"" says Danai. Pakorn says he does not know if getting older and wiser in the future will help his son get closer to him again, and put them back on the same track they both used to be on. Danai is not sure either.""It might be possible that I might change my mind about the institution. But I don't think it will happen because I will get older,"" he says. ""It depends on what happens in reality and the information I receive."" The souring of their relationship because of their opposing views on the king reflects a widening generational divide emblematic of Thai society. Since the student protests started, families all over Thailand have become increasingly divided. Parents and children, brothers and sisters, aunts and nephews are all becoming strangers. A young generation of Thais is questioning the monarchy and everything it represents - and this is likely to be just the beginning of a long, internal struggle."

They carried slogans that read ""Release our friends"", referring to the more than 40 people arrested this week.The crowd quickly grew, from a few dozen, to thousands, swollen by commuters stopping to join what has now become a national mood of rebellion on their way home, the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok reports.

201,Thailand blocks Change.org as petition against king gains traction,"Thailand has blocked access to online petition site Change.org, after it hosted a petition calling for King Maha Vajiralongkorn to be declared persona non grata in Germany.The Ministry of Digital Economy and Society said the petition's contents violated Thailand's Computer Crime Act. King Vajiralongkorn has been criticised by protesters for spending much of his time in Germany. The petition attracted nearly 130,000 signatures before the site was blocked.It comes as Thailand is seeing some of its biggest pro-democracy protests in years. Protesters are demanding amendments to the constitution, a new election and the resignation of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha.Why Thai protesters are willing to break the law Thailand's lese-majeste law explained They are also calling for curbs on the king's power, in a country where criticism of the monarchy is punishable by long prison sentences. The petition - written in Thai, English and German - was originated by a Thai graduate student in France, according to BBC Thai. In it, he called for Germany to declare the king persona non grata and disallow him from continuing ""any further residence in Germany"".It attracted almost 130,000 signatures before the site was blocked in Thailand, with an online notice saying that the content had been suspended for breaking the Computer-related Crime Act 2007 and or/ the Gambling Act 1935. The petition, which is still available outside Thailand, comes after Germany's foreign minister said that King Vajiralongkorn should not be engaging in politics from inside Germany. Speaking in response to a question by an opposition MP, he added that ""if there are guests in our country that conduct state business from our soil, we would always want to counteract that"".King Vajiralongkorn ascended to the Thai throne in 2016, but is known to spend much of his time in Bavaria. He is currently on a visit to Thailand.On Thursday, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in the capital Bangkok, despite a government decree banning demonstrations. A day earlier, protesters had jeered and held up their trademark three-finger salute as a motorcade passed carrying the queen through Bangkok.This emergency decree has now been extended to a month, say local media reports.The protests were triggered earlier this year after a popular opposition political party was ordered to dissolve. The movement has since become the biggest challenge in years to Thailand's establishment."
202,Thai protests: Tens of thousands gather again in mass defiance of government,"Tens of thousands of pro-democracy protesters gathered again in the Thai capital Bangkok on Thursday in mass defiance of the government which had issued a decree banning demonstrations.The protesters cheered and chanted peacefully, eventually dispersing several hours after a new 6pm curfew.They called for the release of at least 20 activists arrested on Thursday in a sweeping crackdown by police. Many made a three-finger salute - a symbol of the protest movement.After peacefully leaving the site of the demonstration at Bangkok's Ratchaprasong Intersection, the protesters vowed to return on Friday at 17:00 local time (10:00 GMT).This week saw the first protests of this movement take place while King Maha Vajiralongkorn was in the country - significantly raising the stakes. The king, who now spends most of his time abroad, has returned from Germany for several weeks.In the early hours of Thursday morning, the government had attempted to curtail the student-led protest movement by issuing an emergency decree banning gatherings of more than four people and arresting about 20 activists - taking the total number of arrests this week to about 40.The student daring to challenge Thailand’s monarchyWhy Thai protesters are willing to break the law Several key protest leaders were among those arrested, including human rights lawyer Anon Nampa, student activist Parit Chiwarak - widely known by his nickname ""Penguin"" - and Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul.In a widely watched livestream video, officers were seen reading out charges to Ms Panusaya in a hotel room. Another video showed police putting her into a car as she and her supporters chanted slogans. The protest movement they have helped lead began by calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha - a former army chief who seized power in a 2014 coup and was appointed premier after controversial elections last year - and has expanded since to call for curbs on the powers of the king.The calls for royal reforms are particularly sensitive in Thailand, where criticism of the monarchy is punishable by long prison sentences.The months of protests leading up to the emergency decree issued on Thursday represent the biggest challenge in years to Thailand's establishment, which is dominated by the military and royal palace. On Wednesday, protesters jeered and held up the three-finger salute as a motorcade passed carrying the queen through Bangkok. The proximity of the demonstration to the royal convoy was cited by the government in a televised address as one of the reasons for the emergency decree. But the protesters ignored the new rules on Thursday afternoon to once again gather in their thousands.""Like dogs cornered, we are fighting till our deaths,"" Panupong ""Mike Rayong"" Jadnok, one the high-profile protest leaders who remains free, told the crowd. ""We won't fall back. We won't run away. We won't go anywhere.""Police appealed to the crowd to disperse, eventually setting a 18:00 curfew. ""The people who came know that there is a ban against public gathering of five or more,"" said police spokesman Kissana Phathanacharoen. ""We will take things step by step.""Few in Thailand will have been surprised to hear of the arrest of the main protest leaders and tougher restrictions on freedom of assembly and expression. Some may even have been relieved that it did not end in bloodshed, as so often before in political crises here.When Anon Nampa, a deceptively mild-looking lawyer, first called for an honest discussion about the monarchy, on 3 August, you could almost hear the collective intake of breath across the country at his boldness. When Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul read out 10 demands for royal reform and accountability from a university stage a week later, Thailand braced itself for a backlash. In a country where every constitution requires the king to ""be held in a position of revered worship"", this was akin to blasphemy.The backlash did not come. A government struggling under the weight of multiple challenges, from the dire economic outlook to a series of scandals, seemed reluctant to risk provoking further public anger.But the persistence of large-scale rallies, where protesters ridiculed the royal institution, could not be tolerated for long, especially now that the king had returned to Thailand for an extended stay. With their leaders locked up outside Bangkok and any public gatherings banned, the movement will find it hard to keep going. The authorities may also go after those they believe have been funding the protests. But what has been said about the monarchy cannot be unsaid. A taboo has been broken. People of all ages, from all parts of the country, aside from die-hard royalists, now agree with the student leaders, that the monarchy is fair game in any overhaul of Thailand's institutions. It is only a matter of time before we see similar protests again.Thailand has a long history of political unrest and protest but a new wave began in February after a popular opposition political party was ordered to dissolve. The order followed elections in March last year - the first since the military seized power in 2014 and the first chance to vote for many young people and first-time voters. The elections were seen as an opportunity for change after years of military rule. Prayuth Chan-ocha: Thailand's face of hybrid democracyThai pro-democracy party dissolved over loanWith the all-important support of the military, Prayuth Chan-ocha was re-installed as prime minister. The pro-democracy Future Forward Party (FFP), with its charismatic leader Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, garnered the third-largest share of seats and was particularly popular with young, first-time voters. But in February a court ruled the FFP had received a loan from Thanathorn which was deemed a donation - making it illegal - and the party was forced to disband, prompting thousands of young Thais to join street protests.The protests were halted by Covid-19 restrictions, which banned gatherings, but they began again in June when a prominent pro-democracy activist went missing.Wanchalearm Satsaksit, who had been living in Cambodia in exile since 2014, was reportedly grabbed off the street and bundled off into a vehicle. Protesters accused the Thai state of orchestrating his kidnapping - a charge police and government officials have denied.The satirist who vanished in broad daylight In recent months, the protesters have challenged the king's decision to declare Crown wealth as his personal property, which made him by far the wealthiest person in Thailand. It had until now been notionally held in trust for the benefit of the people.There have also been questions over the king's decision to take personal command of all military units based in Bangkok - a concentration of military power in royal hands unprecedented in modern Thailand."
203,Thai protests: How pro-democracy movement gained momentum,"Thousands of young people in Thailand are defying the authorities by gathering in the streets and calling for change in some of the biggest pro-democracy protests the country has seen in years.An emergency decree banning such rallies was issued by the government in an attempt to clamp down on the largely peaceful demonstrations that have also targeted the monarchy. Despite this, the student-led democracy movement continues to march, leading to numerous arrests.But what is behind this new movement led by young Thais? The growing pro-democracy movement has been calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha - the former army chief who seized power in a 2014 coup and was later appointed as premier after controversial elections last year.Disillusioned by years of military rule, protesters are demanding amendments to the constitution, a new election and an end to the harassment of rights activists and state critics. They are also calling for curbs on the king's powers - a demand that has led to unprecedented public discussion of an institution long shielded from criticism by law.Thailand's lese-majeste law, which forbids insults to the monarchy, is among the strictest in the world. Those found guilty of breaching it face up to 15 years in jail. Critics say it is used to suppress free speech. Thailand's lese-majeste law explainedIn an attempt to ""maintain peace and order"", the Thai government has issued an emergency decree banning large gatherings, limiting groups to a maximum of four people. But protesters have since been marching against the ban, with hundreds taking to the streets of the capital Bangkok. Some have been targeting the prime minister's office, and the government has responded by deploying riot police. The students risking it all to challenge the monarchyAmong those arrested in the latest demonstrations are three protest leaders - the human rights lawyer Anon Nampa, student activist Parit Chiwarak, widely known by his nickname ""Penguin"", and Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul.Mr Anon, 36, was the first to openly break the taboo on discussing Thailand's monarchy by calling for reforms in August. Ms Panusaya became one of the most prominent faces of the protests after she delivered a 10-point manifesto urging royal reform later that month.The two men have been arrested before. But Ms Panusaya, 21, had not been arrested until now. She was taken away in a wheelchair while giving a three-finger salute. The three-fingered salute is a gesture taken from the Hunger Games film franchise, where it is a rousing symbol of defiance against an authoritarian state. Unlike previous conflicts between the Red and Yellow shirts - supporters of opposing political factions in Thailand - this conflict is between older and younger generations.Thailand has a long history of political unrest and protest, but a new wave began in February, after a popular opposition political party was ordered to dissolve. It followed elections in March last year - the first since the military seized power in 2014. For many young people and first-time voters, it was seen as a chance for change after years of military rule. But the military had taken steps to entrench its political role, and the election saw Prayuth Chan-ocha - the military leader who led the coup - re-installed as prime minister.Prayuth Chan-ocha: Thailand's face of hybrid democracyThe pro-democracy Future Forward Party (FFP), with its charismatic leader Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, garnered the third-largest share of seats and was particularly popular with young, first-time voters. But in February, a court ruled the FFP had received a loan from Thanathorn which was deemed a donation - thus making it illegal - and the party was forced to disband. Thai pro-democracy party dissolved over loanThousands then participated in street protests. However, these were then halted by Covid-19 restrictions, technically banning the gatherings under Thailand's coronavirus state of emergency - breaking the ban carried a possible two-year prison sentence. But things heated up again in June when a prominent pro-democracy activist went missing.Wanchalearm Satsaksit, who had been living in Cambodia in exile since 2014, was reportedly grabbed off the street and bundled off into a vehicle.The satirist who vanished in broad daylight Protesters accused the Thai state of orchestrating his kidnapping, which the police and government have denied.In recent months they have widened to call for curbs on the powers of King Vajiralongkorn, who now spends most of his time abroad.The protesters have challenged the king's decision to declare Crown wealth as his personal property, making him by far the wealthiest person in Thailand. It had until now been notionally held in trust for the benefit of the people.There have also been questions over his decision to take personal command of all military units based in Bangkok - a concentration of military power in royal hands unprecedented in modern Thailand.The movement's ability to continue to amass the large-scale rallies seen in recent months will be difficult following the crackdown on public gatherings, especially with some high profile campaigners detained outside Bangkok. However, at least one student leader has vowed that the demonstrations will continue. In footage shared widely on social media, Ms Panusaya said the government's emergency measures should be ignored. In recent months, small ""flashmob"" type protests that are easy to organise and can quickly disperse have been mobilised in smaller cities, driven by social media. And now, people of all ages, from all parts of the country - aside from die-hard royalists - appear to agree with the student leaders that the monarchy is fair game in any overhaul of Thailand's institutions, says the BBC's Jonathan Head. It is only a matter of time before we see more of these protests in Thailand, our correspondent adds. Whether the demonstrations will have enough of an impact to force constitutional change remains to be seen. "
204,Thai protest leader Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul arrested,"Thailand has announced an emergency decree amid large protests in Bangkok.The government has said urgent measures were needed to maintain peace and order.On Thursday morning police arrested several activists and key protest leaders, including Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul.A livestream video of her arrest showed police officers escorting the student protester out of a hotel and carrying her into a car. The student protester was filmed shouting ""down with feudalism, long live the people""."
205,Thai protesters confront royals in Bangkok visit,"Pro-democracy protesters in Thailand have confronted a motorcade carrying members of the royal family as it passed through a rally in Bangkok.The protesters, who were pushed back by ranks of police, raised the three-finger salute that has become a symbol of the protest movement.They have called for curbs on the king's powers and for the resignation of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha.The protests on Wednesday follow months of escalating tension in the country.The peaceful confrontation happened on Wednesday evening as Queen Suthida was travelling in a motorcade on the streets of Bangkok after attending a Buddhist ceremony at the Grand Palace.As her car passed by, a crowd of protesters chanted and raised their hands in the three-finger salute. The gesture is thought to have been inspired by the Hunger Games films in which it is used as a symbol of unity and defiance.Earlier in the afternoon, the king and queen had travelled together without incident to the Grand Palace along Ratchadamnoen Avenue, where demonstrations had took place earlier in the day. Most of the protesters had moved out of the site by the time their motorcade went past, leaving royalists along the route.Supporters of the monarchy, dressed in t-shirts in royal yellow colour, staged rival protests in the capital, with some filmed violently attacking the pro-democracy protesters. Some witnesses accused the government of disguising police as royalist demonstrators.The two sides had gathered separately along Ratchadamnoen Avenue on Wednesday afternoon and were kept largely apart by police. The anti-government protesters linked arms and marched chanting ""Prayuth, get out!"" - referring to the prime minister - and ""Long live the people!""The protesters were prevented from reaching Government House by what appeared to be ranks of royalist supporters wearing yellow t-shirts who linked arms and shouted insults at the protesters. ""We want to show that we love the king,"" 47-year-old Sirilak Kasemsawat told AFP news agency, accusing the pro-democracy movement of wanting to ""overthrow"" the monarchy - a charge the movement has always denied.""We're not asking them to be toppled, forgotten, or not to be respected,"" said Dear Thatcha, a pro-democracy protester. ""We're just asking them to change with us. Our country needs to adapt to many things, and the monarchy is one of the issues that needs to be adapted as well,"" she said.The growing student-led protest movement, which began in July, has become the greatest challenge in years to Thailand's ruling establishment. Protests over the weekend in the capital were some of the largest in years, with thousands defying authorities to gather and demand change.Authorities say 18,000 people joined Saturday's demonstration, although others gave higher figures. Many stayed to continue the protest into Sunday before dispersing.The protesters' calls for royal reform are particularly sensitive in Thailand, where criticism of the monarchy is punishable by long prison sentences.Ratchadamnoen Avenue - literally the King's Walk - has been the scene of many of Thailand's political battles. This afternoon, the student-led anti-government movement managed to occupy Democracy Monument, the Art Deco sculpture which symbolises the end of the absolute monarchy 88 years ago. But this time large numbers of royalist demonstrators in yellow t-shirts lined the boulevard, with members of the security forces conspicuous among them. For the first time since these protests began in July, King Vajiralongkorn is in Bangkok at the same time, and his motorcade was due to travel down Ratchadamnoen.The potential for violence was real; police sources said they were at their highest threat level. A few flowerpots were thrown in some brief skirmishes around the monument, but for the most part both sides showed great restraint, and the anti-government side was allowed to march unchallenged. They chanted reformist mantras and revolutionary slogans on their way to the office of the prime minister - by now thoroughly barricaded by concrete and razor wire - and the risk of a clash and a royal embarrassment was averted. But the demands of younger protesters in particular, that the monarchy be made accountable to elected institutions, are undiluted, and expressed with breath-taking frankness when you consider the price paid by royal critics in the past. This constitution, like all its predecessors, states at the top that the king must be held in a position of revered worship. These protesters are adamant this must change, that such a wealthy, powerful and expensive institution must be accountable. The government is equally adamant that the monarchy cannot be discussed. At some point, something will have to crack. Thailand has a long history of political unrest and protest, but a new wave began in February after a court ordered a fledgling pro-democracy opposition party to dissolve.The Future Forward Party (FFP) had proved particularly popular with young, first-time voters and garnered the third-largest share of parliamentary seats in the March 2019 election, which was won by the incumbent military leadership.Protests were re-energised in June when prominent pro-democracy activist Wanchalearm Satsaksit went missing in Cambodia, where he had been in exile since the 2014 military coup. His whereabouts remain unknown and protesters accuse the Thai state of orchestrating his kidnapping - something the police and government have denied. Since July there have been regular student-led street protests. Demonstrators have demanded that the government headed by Prime Minister Prayuth, a former army chief who seized power in the coup, be dissolved; that the constitution be rewritten; that the authorities stop harassing critics."

The crash happened on Sunday morning, 50km (31 miles) east of Bangkok.Thai police said passengers inside the bus were on their way to a temple to mark the end of Buddhist Lent. Images from the scene show the bus upturned on its side, heavily damaged and objects scattered along the train tracks. Rescue workers say they need a crane to be able to lift the bus. There were 60 passengers travelling in the bus at the time of the crash, province governor Maitree Tritilanond said. Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha gave his condolences and called for a thorough investigation. Life and death on Thailand's lethal roadsPregnant woman killed in Thailand crashTraffic collisions are common in Thailand, with poor safety standards and busy roads thought to be key factors. A 2018 report from the World Health Organization (WHO) said Thailand had the second-highest traffic fatality rate in the world. In March 2018, at least 18 people died and dozens wounded when a bus in north eastern Thailand swerved off the road and smashed into a tree. At least three people were killed in 2016 when a train collided with a double-decker bus carrying tourists at an unguarded railway crossing west of Bangkok. "

209,US man avoids jail in Thailand over bad resort review,"A US man in Thailand who was arrested for writing a negative hotel review will avoid legal action and jail time. Wesley Barnes had posted several reviews allegedly accusing the Sea View Resort of ""modern day slavery"".He was subsequently detained and charged under Thailand's strict anti-defamation laws.Police said Mr Barnes and the resort had managed to reach an agreement, which included an apology to the hotel and to Thailand's tourism authority.He was also told to send a statement to foreign media organisations that had previously written about his then possible arrest, including BBC News.In it, Mr Barnes said that he apologised for his ""repeatedly false and untrue statements... made to maliciously defame Sea View. These reviews were written out of anger and malice"".The statement said he regretted his actions, adding that ""the hotel has forgiven me and agreed to withdraw the complaint"". Colonel Kitti Maleehuan, superintendent of the Koh Chang police station - the island where the resort is located - told the AFP news agency that both parties had met over a mediation session overseen by police. Mr Barnes will also have to provide ""an explanation to the US embassy"", said AFP - though it did not elaborate.The hotel had said it would withdraw its complaint against Mr Barnes if he met all these terms. Mr Barnes had ahead of the mediation session told news agency Reuters that he wanted to ""end this case once and for all"". If found guilty, he could have faced up to two years in prison.Mr Barnes, who works in Thailand, had stayed in the Sea View resort earlier this year. He is said to have got into an argument with staff over him wanting to bring his own bottle of alcohol while dining in the restaurant.A hotel statement said he had ""caused a commotion"" and refused to pay a corkage fee which was eventually waived when the manager intervened.Since leaving, Mr Barnes posted several negative reviews of the property, after which the hotel sued him for defamation.The hotel has alleged that his reviews were ""fabricated, recurrent, and malicious"", with one post on TripAdvisor accusing the hotel of ""modern day slavery"".Mr Barnes, though, had earlier told the BBC that this particular post was never published as it violated TripAdvisor's guidelines.He also said he had already lost his job over the incident and expressed worries that the publicity his case had received would make it harder to find new employment.The hotel told the BBC that after the reviews had been published, it had received cancellations and inquiries about employee treatment.Thailand's tourism sector has been hit hard by the fallout of the global coronavirus pandemic.""Receiving multiple false and defamatory reviews over a period can be extremely damaging, especially, during these incredibly difficult times,"" the statement from the hotel said.They added that they had repeatedly tried to contact Mr Barnes before they filed the suit.""We chose to file a complaint to serve as a deterrent, as we understood he may continue to write negative reviews week after week for the foreseeable future,"" they said.""Despite our multiple efforts to contact him to resolve the matter in an amicable way for well over a month, he chose to ignore us completely.

210,US man faces jail in Thailand over hotel review,"A US man is facing up to two years in jail in Thailand after posting negative reviews of a hotel he stayed in. He was sued by the resort under the country's strict anti-defamation laws. Wesley Barnes, who works in Thailand, had posted several reviews on different platforms allegedly accusing the resort of ""modern day slavery"". The Sea View Resort, however, said the harsh criticism by the former guest was untrue and damaging to the hotel's reputation.""The owner filed a complaint that the defendant had posted unfair reviews on his hotel on the TripAdvisor website,"" police told the AFP news agency. The incident, which occurred at the resort on the island of Koh Chang earlier this year, was apparently triggered by an argument  over Mr Barnes wanting to bring his own bottle of alcohol while dining in the restaurant. A hotel statement said he had ""caused a commotion"" and refused to pay a corkage fee which was eventually waived when the manager intervened.Since leaving, Mr Barnes posted several negative reviews of the property, after which the hotel sued him for defamation.Mr Barnes was subsequently detained and says he spent two nights in prison before he was released on bail. If found guilty of breaking the country's notorious anti-defamation laws he could face up to two years in prison.The hotel has alleged that his reviews were ""fabricated, recurrent, and malicious"", with one post on TripAdvisor accusing the hotel of ""modern day slavery"". Mr Barnes, though, told the BBC that this particular post was never published as it violated TripAdvisor's guidelines. He also said he had already lost his job over the incident and expressed worries that the publicity his case had received would make it harder to find new employment. His next court appointment will be in early October. Mr Barnes added that he was afraid of going to prison given his first few days in detention had been very ""scary"". He still hopes to resolve the case with the hotel directly. But the hotel told the BBC they had repeatedly tried to contact Mr Barnes before they filed the suit. ""We chose to file a complaint to serve as a deterrent, as we understood he may continue to write negative reviews week after week for the foreseeable future,"" they said.""Despite our multiple efforts to contact him to resolve the matter in an amicable way for well over a month, he chose to ignore us completely. He only replied to us when he had been notified of our complaint by the authorities.""The hotel explained that after the reviews had been published, it had received cancellations and inquiries about employee treatment.  The management says it had told Mr Barnes several times they would not go ahead with pressing charges if he stopped writing new ""false"" reviews. ""Receiving multiple false and defamatory reviews over a period can be extremely damaging, especially, during these incredibly difficult times,"" they added. Thailand's tourism sector has been hit hard by the fallout of the global coronavirus pandemic. Jonathan Head, BBC South East Asia correspondent, Thailand Thailand is not unique in criminalising defamation, but the law, which carries a punishment of up to two years in prison, is unusually easy to abuse. I was prosecuted for criminal defamation in 2016 for a report I made for the BBC. The plaintiff dropped the case 18 months later. Plaintiffs do not have to get the police or a prosecutor to file a criminal complaint - they can file directly to a court, and courts rarely reject them. So anyone subject to such a complaint almost invariably becomes a criminal defendant, summoned to court to defend themselves, or subject to arrest if they don't. The defendant will have to post bail, and if a foreigner, will have their passport held by the court and the cases often last many years. They cannot recoup the substantial costs of defending such cases, even if they win, unless they file a separate civil case. The plaintiffs, on the other hand, are not liable to pay costs even if they lose.It gets worse. In Thailand truth is not an automatic defence as it is in many countries. So even if what you have said, or reported, is true, and the plaintiff admits it is true, you can still go to jail, unless you can prove there is a public interest in reporting it. Finding reliable and affordable lawyers is also very difficult.Unsurprisingly, criminal defamation cases are frequently used in commercial or political disputes. Rights groups allege that they are often abused to harass and silence those fighting injustice. One poultry processing company has filed as many as 38 legal cases, many of them criminal defamation, against workers and human rights campaigners who complained about labour abuses. One journalist has already received a two-year prison sentence for social media comments about the case."
211,"Thailand prosecutes Facebook, Google and Twitter over posts","Thailand is prosecuting Facebook, Google, and Twitter over a failure to remove what it says are illegal posts.Officials did not say exactly what they contained but also announced they would take action against individual users for insulting the monarchy.Under Thailand's strict ""lese-majeste"" laws, doing so can result in a prison sentence.This is the first time that computer-crime laws have been used to target the platforms themselves.The announcement follows mass protests in the country demanding political reform.""We've notified the companies and sent them warnings twice, but they haven't complied with all the requests,"" digital minister Puttipong Punnakanta told Reuters news agency.He said the matter had now been referred to cyber-crime police for prosecution.Thailand's lese-majeste law explained Facebook blocks group critical of Thai monarchyAt issue were 661 Facebook posts, of which the company removed 225; 69 on Twitter, of which five were removed, and 289 YouTube links, which were removed on Wednesday after the deadline, according to the Bangkok Post.Under the computer-crimes law, the social-media companies can be fined 200,000 baht (£4,970) for ignoring a court order to take down posts - and an extra 5,000 baht every day until it is removed.In August, Facebook blocked access to a one million-strong Facebook group in Thailand that discussed the monarchy, after a threat of legal action from the Thai government.At the time, Facebook told the BBC it was preparing its own legal action in response to pressure from authorities there.The accompanying announcement about action against individual users follows an anti-government protest last week. Only a handful of prominent accounts are believed to be involved in that.The protest in Bangkok involved thousands of people calling for reform of the country's political system - including the role the monarchy plays. Police estimated about 15,000 people took part; organisers claimed 50,000 did so.The calls for reform of the monarchy are highly sensitive. Thailand's criminal code allows for prosecution for criticism of the royal family - often in secret trials, resulting in long prison sentences. Human rights groups allege that the law has been used as a way of limiting free speech and calls for reform.Facebook and Twitter declined to comment on the case, and Google has yet to respond."
212,Former headmaster jailed for sexual abuse in Aberdeen and Thailand,"A former headmaster who admitted subjecting a girl to a catalogue of sexual abuse in Aberdeen and Asia has been jailed for nine years.Arthur Hutchinson, 74, began targeting the victim when she was aged eight in Thailand, and continued when she moved to Scotland to pursue higher education.She did not resist as she was afraid he would withdraw financial support from her family and stop her education.After release, he will face a further three years period of supervision.The court heard that the victim revealed that she had been sexually abused to a counsellor. Former headmaster admits catalogue of sexual abuseAfter arresting Hutchinson, police seized a laptop which contained videos and images of the victim.He admitted five charges.Hutchinson was a school teacher for more than 40 years, and latterly was employed as the headmaster of a secondary school in West Yorkshire before retiring in 2008.The first offender went abroad to live two years later and settled in Thailand where he began abusing the child.Lord Fairley, at the High Court in Edinburgh, said: ""Your offending involved a sustained course of conduct against your victim over a period of nine years."" The judge said that the crimes had involved ""a high degree of coercion and control"".He said a background report prepared on the offender showed that he demonstrated ""little or no empathy or understanding of the effect of you long term abuse"".Lord Fairley told him that had he been convicted after a trial he would have faced a 16-year sentence, including 13 years imprisonment.But the judge said that following his earlier guilty pleas he would sentence Hutchinson to nine years in custody with a further three years period of supervision.Defence counsel Graham Robertson said Hutchinson now realised that there was a high probability that he would end his life in prison for offences that were ""shameful, disgraceful and abhorrent"".He said: ""My understanding is that he in unable to explain in any rational or articulate way why he behaved in the way he did.""Hutchinson, who followed the proceedings by video link from Grampian Prison, was placed on the sex offenders register indefinitely.Det Insp Karen Main of Police Scotland said it was a ""particularly harrowing"" case of sexual abuse."

Installed just a day earlier, it was seen as a bold act in a nation where criticising the monarchy can mean long prison terms.It followed weeks of unprecedented protests calling for royal reforms and resignation of the prime minister.Police said they were investigating the missing plaque, news agencies reported.Bangkok’s deputy police chief Piya Tawichai also warned that they may charge the protesters who installed the plaque, according to Reuters.Thai activists challenge monarchy by laying plaqueThe student daring to challenge Thailand’s monarchyOn Saturday Bangkok saw some of its largest protests in years close to the Grand Palace, with thousands defying authorities to demand change.The plaque was installed in the historic Sanam Luang field to the sound of cheers on Sunday morning, proclaiming in Thai: ""The people have expressed the intention that this country belongs to the people, and not the king.""Organisers said it was a replacement for another marking the end of absolute monarchy in the 1930s, which went missing in 2017.Student-led protests first began in July against Thailand's government.These called for General Prayuth Chan-ocha, who seized power in 2014 and won disputed elections last year, to step down. But the rallies took a staggering turn the following month when they began to include calls for reform to the monarchy.The Thai royal family has long been shielded from criticism under draconian lese-majeste laws, which can see those accused punished with up to 15 years in jail.In August protesters broke the taboo, and at one rally a 10-point call for reform to the monarchy was read out.Why young people are protesting in ThailandThai lese-majeste explainedThe plaque has quickly become a powerful symbol of Thailand's democracy movement. On social media some activists said they assumed it would be removed, and even before it was reported missing digital versions in pastels and rainbow hues were being widely shared.It has ""already been imprinted in the minds of many Thais"", wrote one Twitter user."
214,Thailand protests: Activists challenge monarchy by laying 'People's Plaque',"Anti-government protesters have installed a plaque declaring Thailand ""belongs to the people"", in a bold show of opposition to the monarchy.

The plaque, dated 20 September, 2020, proclaims in Thai: ""The people have expressed the intention that this country belongs to the people, and not the king.""Organisers said the plaque was a replacement for another marking the end of absolute monarchy in the 1930s, which went missing in 2017.The mystery of the missing brass plaqueThe students risking it all to challenge the monarchyCheers erupted as activists installed the new plaque, with protesters chanting: ""Down with feudalism, long live the people.""Police did not intervene and there were no reports of violence. A spokesman for the Thai government told Reuters news agency police would not use violence against protesters.Later on, protesters who had planned to march to Government House were blocked from doing so by hundreds of unarmed police manning crowd control barriers.Instead, the protesters marched to hand a letter of demands for reform of the monarchy to the king's Royal Guard police.Protest leaders declared victory after saying Royal Guard police had agreed to pass on their demands to police headquarters. There has been no comment from the police.""Our greatest victory in the two days is to show that ordinary people like us can send a letter to royals,"" protest leader Parit ""Penguin"" Chiwarak said, telling crowds to return for another demonstration next week.Thailand has a long history of political unrest and protest, but a new wave began in February after a court ordered a fledgling pro-democracy opposition party to dissolve.The Future Forward Party (FFP) had proved particularly popular with young, first-time voters and garnered the third-largest share of parliamentary seats in the March 2019 election, which was won by the incumbent military leadership.Protests were re-energised in June when prominent pro-democracy activist Wanchalearm Satsaksit went missing in Cambodia, where he had been in exile since the 2014 military coup. His whereabouts remain unknown and protesters accuse the Thai state of orchestrating his kidnapping - something the police and government have denied. Since July there have been regular student-led street protests. Demonstrators have demanded that the government headed by Prime Minister Chan-ocha, a former army chief who seized power in the coup, be dissolved; that the constitution be rewritten; that the authorities stop harassing critics.The demands of protesters took an unprecedented turn last month when a 10-point call for reform to the monarchy was read out at one rally. The move sent shockwaves through a country which is taught from birth to revere and love the monarchy and fear the consequences of talking about it.The young woman who delivered the manifesto, Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul, has said their intention ""is not to destroy the monarchy but to modernise it, to adapt it to our society"".But she and her fellow activists have been accused of ""chung chart"" - a Thai term meaning ""hatred of the nation"" - and they say they are deeply fearful of the consequences of doing ""the right thing"" by speaking out.Each of Thailand's 19 constitutions of modern times has stated, at the top, that: ""The King shall be enthroned in a position of revered worship"" and that ""no person shall expose the King to any sort of accusation or action"".These provisions are backed by article 112 of the criminal code, known as the lese-majeste law, which subjects anyone criticising the royal family to secret trials and long prison sentences.The definition of what constitutes an insult to the monarchy is unclear and human rights groups say the law has often been used as a political tool to curb free speech and opposition calls for reform and change.The law had been increasingly enforced in the years after the 2014 coup, although it has slowed since King Vajiralongkorn let it be known he no longer wanted it to be so widely used. But observers say the government has used other legal routes, including the sedition law, to target dissent.Why young people are protesting in ThailandThe satirist who vanished in broad daylight Thai lese-majeste explained"
215,Thailand protests: Thousands join huge rally demanding reforms,"Thousands of people have protested in the Thai capital Bangkok calling for reform of the political system, including the role of the monarchy.It was one of the biggest protests in years with at least 15,000 people, police said. ""Down with feudalism, long live the people,"" chanted some.There were no reports of violence.Since July, rallies have called for the resignation of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha who took power in a 2014 coup and won disputed elections last year.Saturday's student-led demonstration moved from the campus of Thammasat University to a park next to a grand palace used for royal ceremonies.Demonstrators say they plan to stay overnight and march to the offices of the prime minister on Sunday morning.""I hope the people in power will see the importance of the people,"" student leader Panupong ""Mike"" Jadnok, told the crowd, according to Reuters news agency. ""We're fighting to put the monarchy in the right place, not to abolish it.""The calls for royal reform are particularly sensitive in Thailand, with criticism of the monarchy punishable by long prison sentences.Organisers gave a much higher estimate for Saturday's turnout, saying 50,000 people had attended. A protest in August drew around 10,000 protesters.Thailand has a long history of political unrest and protest, but a new wave began in February after a court ordered a fledgling pro-democracy opposition party to dissolve.The Future Forward Party (FFP) had proved particularly popular with young, first-time voters and garnered the third-largest share of parliamentary seats in the March 2019 election, which was won by the incumbent military leadership.Protests were re-energised in June when prominent pro-democracy activist Wanchalearm Satsaksit went missing in Cambodia, where he had been in exile since the 2014 military coup. His whereabouts remain unknown and protesters accuse the Thai state of orchestrating his kidnapping - something the police and government have denied. Since July there have been regular student-led street protests. Demonstrators have demanded that the government headed by Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former army chief who seized power in the coup, be dissolved; that the constitution be rewritten; that the authorities stop harassing critics.Why young people are protesting in ThailandThe students risking it all to challenge the monarchyThe satirist who vanished in broad daylight Thai lese-majeste explainedA series of political scandals, together with the economic disruption caused of Covid-19, have stirred public discontent in Thailand with the government, and sympathy for the student-led protests. The protest leaders hope that with this ambitious rally at the heart of Bangkok's old royal quarter they can keep up the momentum of their movement, which has already pushed the government to agree to discuss changes to the constitution.However, the government and its conservative supporters have denounced the students' other demand, for limits to be imposed on the spending, and on the political and military authority, of the king. The monarchy's status, they say, is untouchable.The protesters have now carried out a symbolic occupation of the park where the biggest royal ceremonies take place; once a large, open, grassy space, it has been fenced off in recent years,  part of what activists say is a worrying expansion of royal power.Publicly involving the monarchy in political disputes is something new in Thailand, an inflammatory move in a country where the institution is officially revered, but, the protest leaders say, one that is an essential prerequisite to modernising the political system.The demands of protesters took an unprecedented turn last month when a 10-point call for reform to the monarchy was read out at one rally. The move sent shockwaves through a country which is taught from birth to revere and love the monarchy and fear the consequences of talking about it.The young woman who delivered the manifesto, Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul, has said their intention ""is not to destroy the monarchy but to modernise it, to adapt it to our society"".But she and her fellow activists have been accused of ""chung chart"" - a Thai term meaning ""hatred of the nation"" - and they say they are deeply fearful of the consequences of doing ""the right thing"" by speaking out.Each of Thailand's 19 constitutions of modern times has stated, at the top, that: ""The King shall be enthroned in a position of revered worship"" and that ""no person shall expose the King to any sort of accusation or action"".These provisions are backed by article 112 of the criminal code, known as the lese-majeste law, which subjects anyone criticising the royal family to secret trials and long prison sentences.The definition of what constitutes an insult to the monarchy is unclear and human rights groups say the law has often been used as a political tool to curb free speech and opposition calls for reform and change.One man in 2015 faced up to 15 years in prison for posting images on social media of the then-king's favourite dog in a way that appeared to mock the monarch. Other ways of falling foul of the law include ""liking"" any critical reference on social media, questioning anything from Thai history that could be construed as negative to the monarch, or producing a book or play with characters resembling members of the royal family.The law had been increasingly enforced in the years after the 2014 coup, although it has slowed since King Vajiralongkorn let it be known he no longer wanted it to be so widely used. But observers say the government has used other legal routes, including the sedition law, to target dissent."

217,Thai national park sends rubbish back to tourists,"If you litter in this Thai national park, your rubbish may just come back to haunt you. Well, not exactly haunt, but it'll be shipped to your home as a pointed reminder that when out in nature, you had better clean up after yourself. Authorities in the popular Khao Yai National Park near Bangkok will start sending rubbish back to litterers, Thailand's environment minister said.Offenders will also be registered with the police.Visitors to the park have to register with their addresses, making it easy for rangers to track them down if they leave rubbish behind.Environment Minister Varawut Silpa-archa posted pictures of litter collected in cardboard parcels ready to be shipped on his Facebook account. ""Your trash - we'll send it back to you,"" the post warns, reminding people that littering in a national park is an offence and punishable with up to five years in prison and hefty fines. Bali's battle against plastic pollution'Staggering' levels of plastic pollution by 2040Along with empty plastic bottles, cans and chips wrappings, the box in the Facebook post contains a polite note saying: ""You forgot these things at Khao Yai National Park"".Park authorities say the rubbish left behind can be particularly dangerous for animals who may try to eat it. Khao Yai National Park which is north-east of the Thai capital Bangkok stretches across more than 2,000 sq km (770 sq miles) and is very popular with hikers. It's the oldest national park in Thailand and known for its waterfalls, animals and scenery. "
218,Coronavirus: Singapore and Thailand added to England's 'quarantine-free' list,"People arriving from Singapore and Thailand in England and Scotland will not need to quarantine from Saturday morning, the government has said.They have been added to the list of ""travel corridor"" countries. But travellers coming from Slovenia and Guadeloupe will have to self-isolate for two weeks. Both have also been added to Wales' quarantine list, while arrivals there from Gibraltar and Thailand will not need to self-isolate. The changes come into force at 04:00 BST on Saturday. Which countries are on UK's quarantine lists?The Department for Transport (DfT) said there had been ""a significant change in both the level and pace of confirmed cases of coronavirus"" in both Slovenia and Guadeloupe. Data from Slovenia shows that its seven-day rate of cases is 29.1 per 100,000 people, up from 14.4 in the previous seven days.The rate for Guadeloupe has risen more than six-fold in the past four weeks, the DfT said.When a country's rate rises above 20, the UK government considers imposing quarantine restrictions. Travellers who do not self-isolate when they are supposed to can be fined £1,000 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, or £480 in Scotland. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps reminded passengers they were required by law to fill in a passenger locator form.The form asks travellers to provide their contact details and UK address. Passengers can be fined up to £3,200 in England if they do not provide accurate contact details, or £1,920 in Wales.""This is vital in protecting public health and ensuring those who need to are complying with self-isolation rules,"" Mr Shapps said. The quarantine lists have changed - what's new?The decision to remove quarantine restrictions for arrivals from Thailand and Singapore is unlikely to lead in a surge of people from England visiting as both countries are only allowing people to enter for a limited number of reasons, such as if they have a work permit or are the spouse or child of a resident.  Denmark retained its quarantine exemption, despite its seven-day case rate being 33.8.The DfT urged employers to be ""understanding"" of people returning from Slovenia and Guadeloupe, as they will need to self-isolate.The statement gave no update on the possible introduction of testing at airports as a way of reducing quarantine requirements.The travel industry has demanded this should take place urgently to avoid further job losses.Earlier this week, British Airways boss Alex Cruz called for trials to be held for passengers flying between London and New York.He said ""this is imperative"", adding that the airline is ""still fighting for our own survival"".Last week, Sweden was made exempt from quarantine for Wales, England and Scotland.At the same time, Portugal was placed back on England's quarantine list after a rise in infections. It comes as coronavirus cases in the UK rose by 3,395 on Thursday, government figures showed, while deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test increased by 21."
219,The student daring to challenge Thailand’s monarchy,"""There was fear lurking inside me, deep fear of the consequences,"" says Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul. In August, the 21-year-old nervously stepped onto a stage in Thailand and delivered an open challenge to the monarchy.To the cheering of thousands of students of one of Thailand's top universities, she read out a now-famous 10-point manifesto, calling for reform of the monarchy.It was a shocking move. Thais are taught from birth to revere and love the monarchy, but also to fear the consequences of speaking about it. Thailand is one of the few countries with a lese majeste law. Anyone criticising the king, the queen, the heir-apparent or the regent could be jailed for up to 15 years.But in the past few months, pro-democracy protests have swept the country, and students like Panusaya are at the heart of it. ""I knew my life would never be the same,"" she later told BBC News Thai.Panusaya had been shown the manifesto just hours before she read it out at a rare large protest in the capital, Bangkok. It called for a monarchy accountable to the elected institutions, a proposal to trim the royal budget and for the monarchy to refrain from interfering in politics - shocking statements to most Thais. ""They passed it to me, asked me if I wished to use it. At that point, everyone felt the content was extraordinarily strong and I too thought it was very strong. I decided to be that person who says it.""I held hands with my fellow students, asking aloud whether we were doing the right thing here,"" Panusaya says. ""The answer was yes - it's the right thing to do. I then sat down again, smoked a cigarette before I went on stage and let everything in my head out.""The satirist who vanished in broad daylight Profile: Thai General Prayuth Chan-ochaFrom the stage, she told the crowd:  ""All humans have red blood. We are no different.""No-one in this world is born with blue blood. Some people may be born more fortunate than others, but no one is born more noble than anyone else.""Panusaya's speech caused an uproar - a combination of applause from liberal academics, and condemnation from royalist media outlets, mixed with disbelief from many Thais. In the days after the rally, the Facebook pages of top royalist activists were abuzz with attacks on Panusaya, some accusing her of being manipulated by republican politicians, which she denied.Apirat Kongsompong, the powerful army commander in a country still dominated by the military, said the protesters were afflicted by ""chung chart"" - a Thai term meaning ""hatred of the nation"" - and added that this was even more dangerous than the Covid-19 pandemic.""Hating your own country is a disease that is not curable,"" he said.Yet Panusaya says even as a young child she remembers questioning the position of the royal family in Thai life.On one sweltering day, an official showed up at the door and asked her family to leave their house and sit down on the pavement in anticipation of a royal motorcade.The students risking it all to challenge the monarchyWhy young people are protesting in Thailand""Why do we have to come out in the sun for half an hour to see a passing motorcade? I didn't have a clue what's going on. I didn't go out to join the waiting crowds.""The youngest of three sisters, she showed an interest in politics early on. In high school, discussing politics with her close friends was one of her favourite pastimes. When a coup took place in 2014, her father - the only one in the family who followed politics back then - encouraged her to find out more.But Panusaya was shy growing up and was bullied at school. It was five months spent in a student exchange programme to America that changed her completely.""I returned home a different person who was not afraid to speak out and act.""She became increasingly politically active after entering the prestigious Thammasat University. Two years ago, she joined the ""Dome Revolution"", a student union political party. In February, she helped organise the first pro-democracy flash mob protests after the dissolution of the Future Forward Party, a reformist party popular with younger voters that was disbanded after a controversial court ruling that it had accepted illegal loans from its own leader.The party did well in the 2019 elections and its dissolution was viewed by its supporters as an attempt to remove its growing political influence.Profile: Thailand's King VajiralongkornThe sacred water that makes a kingBut these were not the only events to inspire young people to join Thailand's growing student-led pro-democracy movement in recent years.King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who inherited the throne in 2016, is rarely seen in public, and spends most of his time abroad - especially after the country was hit by the coronavirus pandemic, a decision criticised by some Thais on social media. Thailand has also seen a string of corruption scandals. The most controversial was the decision to drop criminal charges against the heir of the Red Bull energy drink company in relation to a fatal traffic accident in 2012.The Thai government says it respects freedom of expression and tolerates criticism, but that students must exercise their rights within the law and must not threaten national security.But the students do fear for their safety. At least nine activists who fled overseas since the 2014 coup against the military-led government have disappeared after criticising Thailand's most revered institution. The bodies of two of them were later found on the banks of a river.The Thai government has vehemently denied it has anything to do with these disappearances.Panusaya says that since the night she delivered the manifesto, her movements have been monitored by the authorities day and night both on campus and at her dormitory.""Although they are in plain clothes, I can tell they are police as they have the same crew cut hair style and are always taking photos of me in public places.""She has not been arrested yet, and says she will never surrender herself to the authorities.She has also not been charged with lese majeste - the laws have been used less in recent years, at the request of the palace - but the police have issued an arrest warrant on charges of sedition, disseminating false information into a computer network and violating disease control laws, as the protests flouted coronavirus restrictions. The sedition charge alone carries a maximum jail term of seven years.And just like other students who have been accused of ""crossing the line"", Panusaya also faces tension at home. Her mother is among those horrified by her decision and pleaded with her to not go to the rally.For five days afterwards, they didn't speak to each other.""Obviously, my mother is concerned, but she does not show it and acts normally when I am around. But when she is with my older sister, she sometimes cries,"" she says.Her mother later gave in, saying she could do whatever she saw fit - but warned her to steer clear of mentioning the monarchy.But now - as she prepares for a rally on 19 September - Panusaya is mentally preparing herself for prison. The rally will call for various reforms - to the monarchy, the military, the constitution and education. ""I think my mum must understand that we are not doing this for fun. This is serious and we have to do it. We see it as our duty so she must understand. I want her to be proud."""
220,Prayuth Chan-ocha: Thailand's face of hybrid democracy,"Thailand Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who was sworn in last year in June, is facing severe challenges domestically. In July, six of his cabinet members including the finance and deputy prime ministers resigned, which was followed by waves of student protests since 10 August demanding his resignation. Thousands of young protesters who seek a new constitution, an end to the repression of political activists, and reform of the monarchy, came onto the streets raising three-finger salutes, an unofficial symbol of protest which was banned during the May 2014 military coup. Just a month after that bloodless coup in 2014, Gen Prayuth wrested political power with the backing of Thailand's monarchy.Prayuth was born on 21 March 1954 in a military family in Thailand's north eastern province Nakhon Ratchasima. After finishing his middle-level education from the Wat Nuannoradit School, he was sent to the Armed Forces Academies Preparatory School and later joined the prestigious Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy.A staunch supporter of the royal family, he had the opportunity to work in the 21st Infantry Regiment, also known as Queen's Guard under the Second Infantry Division during his initial military career and was later promoted to commander of the regiment. In October 2003, he became the commander of the Second Infantry Division of the Royal Guard and in October 2006, he was promoted to commander of the First Army Area for supporting army chief Gen Anuphong Phaochinda during a coup that year. The coup had been staged to depose the government of then-prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.Prayuth's allegiance to Anuphong grew into a partnership after they formed a military leaders' group known as the Eastern Tigers and Prayuth was appointed deputy chief of the Thai Army in October 2009.He was accused of favouring a military crackdown on the supporters of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the Red Shirt group who were protesting against the Democrat Party-led government for over a month in 2010. After he succeeded Anuphong as the commander-in-chief of the Thai Army on 25 September 2010, he declared himself ""fiercer than Brother Pok [Anuphong]"".In June 2011, he departed from his position that the army would not interfere in politics when he appealed to voters to support ""good people"" in the elections, which was widely construed as a hint to vote against Yingluck Shinawatra, Thaksin's sister.Prayuth then took advantage of a six-month-long political conflict between the Yingluck government and opposition party, and declared a coup on 22 May 2014. Subsequently, a military administration officially known as the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) suspended the constitution and elected him as prime minister of the country on 21 August.After taking the reins, Prayuth enacted an interim constitution that gave the military government unaccountable power. Section 44 of the constitution ensured its absolute authority to issue orders against any activity the government saw as a threat to order, national security or the monarchy.Along with imposing restrictions on civil liberties, media and dissent, Prayuth also took steps to transform his image into that of a benevolent leader. He wrote a song ""Return Happiness to Thailand"" with lines such as ""We will do what we promised… we are asking for a little more time"". The song was widely aired on state radio and television stations.The Nation Books, a subsidiary of the country's Nation Multimedia Group, published his biography titled ""His name is Tu"", referring to his nickname Uncle Tu. The book recounts his journey as a leader and tries to depict a softer side to his authoritarian persona. He also hosted a weekly Friday TV programme titled ""The King's Knowledge for Sustainable Development"", where he publicised the developmental efforts of his military government under the guidance of Thailand's late King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Prayuth drew controversy due to his impulsive and angry behaviour towards the media after becoming head of the country, and he subsequently tried to shut himself off from media to such an extent that in January 2018, he left a life-sized cardboard cut-out of himself for a media Q&A session. But as the 24 March 2019 general election approached, Prayuth's team became active on social media, sharing pictures of choreographed events such as his visit to Thailand's Lumphini Park or him singing on a stage with his supporters.In the election, the Palang Pracharath Party nominated Prayuth as its prime ministerial candidate, and following this, the Thai parliament - which is dominated by members of the military administration - elected him as prime minister on 5 June 2019.

221,Mulan: Why Disney's latest reboot is facing boycott calls,"It's one of the first big movie releases since the coronavirus pandemic shut down cinemas and film production.But Disney's Mulan is facing calls for a boycott in some Asian countries. Liu Yifei, the live-action film's star, first angered fans last year with comments reportedly supporting Hong Kong's police, who have been accused of violence towards pro-democracy protesters. Now Thai and Taiwanese activists are also telling people not to see Mulan.You might remember the huge protests in Hong Kong last year. Young people led months of demonstrations against a law which would allow extradition from Hong Kong to mainland China. The protests widened to include demands for democratic reform and an inquiry into alleged police brutality. During a period of unrest Chinese-born actress Liu Yifei - who's an American citizen - shared a post from the government-run Beijing newspaper People's Daily on Weibo.""I support the Hong Kong police. You can all attack me now. What a shame for Hong Kong,"" it read.It didn't take long for #BoycottMulan to trend on Twitter - a site that is banned in China - while Chinese citizens voiced their support. That was last year, but things are still tense in Hong Kong. The extradition law behind initial protests was dropped, but in April this year many high-profile pro-democracy activists were arrested by Hong Kong police. A month later the police watchdog said it found no significant wrongdoing on the police's part during the 2019 protests. Then in June, China passed a new security law that critics have called the ""end of Hong Kong"". Its details were kept secret until it was passed, but it criminalises many things that could pose a threat to China's authority in Hong Kong - making them punishable by life in prison. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried?With all that history and everything still going on, prominent activist Joshua Wong has called for ""everyone who believes in human rights to #BoycottMulan"". Joshua's claim that Disney ""kowtows to Beijing"" echoes comments made by the US attorney general William Barr last month. He claimed Disney and other Hollywood studios ""bow to Beijing"", censoring films by tweaking scripts and character nationalities in order to ensure distribution in China, which is now the second-biggest movie market in the world.The original Mulan film - released in 1998 and based on a Chinese legend dating back centuries - flopped in the story's birthplace. You may have fond memories of it, but look back and you'll see the idea of China it promoted was pretty stereotypical. Given that ""Chinese takings can make or break a movie"", according to cultural analyst Xueting Christine Ni, Disney wants it to be a success there this time around. It was partly filmed in China, and the script owes more to the original 6th Century source material. Disney wants to win over China with its new Mulan There's a reason we love Mulan. She's a heroine who fights for what she feels is right, despite the many obstacles in her way. With a story like that, it's not surprising protesters in Hong Kong saw her as a symbol for their struggle. When activist Agnes Chow was arrested last month, she was described by supporters as the ""real Mulan"". Now after years of military rule it's Thailand's turn to demand change - with thousands of people taking to the streets this year, particularly over the past month.The student-led movement wants amendments to the constitution and monarchy, a new election, the prime minister to resign and rights activists to stop being harassed. Why young people are protesting in ThailandThey are also anti-China, with worries about the country's influence in the region. That's led to the #MilkTeaAlliance, as protesters in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Thailand have called themselves - based on the sweet drink loved in all three countries. What's behind the China-Taiwan divide?Thai student activist Netiwit Chotiphatphaisal has been using his Twitter to share messages about Mulan in the build up to the film's release, asking people not to watch it so ""Disney and the Chinese government know that the violence of the state against the people is unacceptable"".Mulan's delayed release, straight to Disney Plus rather than in cinemas due to coronavirus, comes off the back of three Disney remakes last year. The six films it has remade since 2015 - Cinderella, The Jungle Book, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Aladdin and Dumbo - have made a combined $5.8bn (£4.4bn) at the box office. So there's clearly an appetite. Disney super-fan Emily Talbut, from the UK, says fans will want to see it ""to support those lesser-known actors and encourage Disney to continue making films like that.""It does have greater diversity than what we've seen before.""The power of Disney's nostalgia during a pandemicChinese viewers spotted some historical inaccuracies in the trailer. But a poll on Weibo when that first trailer came out found that over 115,000 users were ""satisfied"" with what they knew of the film so far.""China finally has its own Disney princess,"" as one user put it.

222,Thai protests: Lawyer Anon Nampa to be jailed over bail breach,"Two prominent activists charged over recent anti-government protests in Thailand are to be jailed after a court revoked their bail.Anon Nampa and Panupong Jadnok were detained last month over a protest in Bangkok at which calls for political reform were made.They and at least nine others including students and rappers are accused of sedition and breaking virus rules.Protesters are demanding an end to military influence over politics.They also want Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who came to power in a 2014 military coup, to resign.The students risking it all to challenge the monarchyWhy young people are protesting in ThailandOn Thursday a court in Bangkok ruled that Mr Anon, 36, and Mr Panupong, 24, had breached their bail conditions by taking part in protests.The pair were sent to pre-trial detention because they declined to post bail again, arguing they had stuck to their bail conditions, Mr Anon's lawyer Weeranan Huadsri told Reuters news agency. They can be held for up to 48 days, Mr Huadsri said.Mr Anon, a human rights lawyer, said his renewed detention amounted to harassment.""My duty outside of prison has ended, and I wanted to gamble everything for change,"" Mr Anon wrote in a Facebook post before the court hearing.He urged people to join another anti-government rally planned for later this month.Mr Anon and Mr Panupong were arrested over a Harry Potter-themed protest that took place in Bangkok on 3 August.At the protest he and other activists made a bold public call for reform of the monarchy. He stressed that he wanted to reform, not overthrow, the constitutional monarchy. However his comments broke a taboo in a country where few dare to openly discuss the institution. Protesters also seek an end to the harassment of political opposition, a new constitution and fresh elections.Also detained were activists Baramee Chairat, Suwanna Tarnlek and Korakot Saengyenpanm, and two popular rappers from the group Rap for Democracy.The activists were charged with provoking unrest and violating coronavirus restrictions, and could face prison sentences of up to seven years if convicted of sedition. All were later released on bail.Thailand's strict lese-majeste law forbids insults to the monarchy. Those found guilty of breaching it face up to 15 years in jail.But in recent weeks, students and other activists have led growing calls for political change in defiance of the law.How Thailand forbids insult of its royaltyCritics say the military-backed government uses the law to clamp down on free speech, and the UN has repeatedly called on Thailand to amend it. But the government says the law is necessary to protect the monarchy, which is widely revered in Thailand.Thais are taught to respect, revere and love the monarchy, but also to fear the consequences of speaking about it.

223,Thailand's king reinstates his consort after her fall from grace,"Thailand's king has reinstated his royal consort to the position, nearly a year after she was stripped of her titles in a dramatic fall from grace. King Vajiralongkorn returned Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi's rank and titles on Wednesday, the Royal Gazette announced.Sineenat was stripped of her rank in October 2019, only months after being named as the king's companion. The palace had said that she was being punished for trying to elevate herself to ""the same state as the queen"". Sineenat was the first royal consort for almost a century in Thailand, where the term refers to a partner in addition to the king's wife.Last year's announcement also accused her of ""misbehaviour and disloyalty against the monarch"". She has not been seen in public since and her whereabouts have not been confirmed.The king's latest decision means that ""Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi is not tarnished"", the Royal Gazette announced. ""Henceforth, it will be as if she had never been stripped of her military ranks or royal decorations."" Born in 1985, she is from northern Thailand and worked as a nurse before entering a relationship with the then-crown prince Vajiralongkorn. She eventually became a bodyguard, pilot and parachutist, and joined the royal guards. In early 2019, she was appointed a major-general.She received the official title of first Royal Noble Consort in July that year, shortly after the king married his fourth wife Queen Suthida, who had been the deputy head of his personal security detail.Just a few months later, in October, Sineenat was unexpectedly stripped of her rank and titles, sparking widespread speculation over what might have prompted the sudden downfall.The true cause of her removal - and her subsequent reinstatement - as royal consort may never be made public, given the secrecy which cloaks palace affairs in Thailand. Thailand's lese-majeste law forbids any criticism of the monarchy, with hefty prison sentences for offenders.How did Thailand's royal consort fall from grace?Rare photos of Thai king’s consort releasedRisking it all to challenge the monarchyThai king shot at with air pistol in GermanyThe removal of Sineenat in 2019 echoed the cases of two of the king's former wives. In 1996, he denounced his second wife, who fled to the United States, and disowned four sons he had with her.In 2014, his third wife Srirasmi Suwadee was similarly stripped of all her titles and banished from the royal court. Her 15-year-old son has been raised by King Vajiralongkorn in Germany and Switzerland.The king, who now spends most of his time in Germany, has seven children in total.Queen Suthida, a former flight attendant for Thai Airways, had been seen with him in public for many years, though their relationship had never been officially acknowledged before he married her.Even after the marriage, his consort Sineenat was a regular guest at royal events until her downfall. Thai kings throughout the centuries took multiple wives - or consorts. But until 2019, the last time a Thai king had taken an official consort was in the 1920s and the title had not been used since the country became a constitutional monarchy in 1932.Wednesday's palace announcement comes amid anti-government protests in Thailand, where the military has entrenched its political rule after a 2014 coup. The protests include demands to curb recently-expanded powers of the king and there have been unprecedented calls to reform the monarchy. The protesters have challenged the king's decision to declare Crown wealth as his personal property, making him by far the wealthiest person in Thailand. It had until now been notionally held in trust for the benefit of the people. There have also been questions over King Vajiralongkorn's decision to take personal command of all military units based in Bangkok - a concentration of military power in royal hands unprecedented in modern Thailand.The king ascended the throne after the death of his much-loved father Bhumibol Adulyadej in 2016. King Bhumibol had ruled for 70 years, making him the longest-reigning monarch in the world at the time of his death."
224,Facebook blocks Thai access to group critical of monarchy,"Facebook has blocked access in Thailand to a million-member group discussing the monarchy, after the Thai government threatened legal action.The firm told the BBC it was preparing its own legal action to respond to the pressure from Bangkok. Thailand is seeing a wave of anti-government protests which have included unprecedented calls for reforms to the monarchy. Criticism of the monarchy is illegal in Thailand.Access from within Thailand to the ""Royalist Marketplace"" group was blocked on Monday evening. The page can still be accessed from outside the country. The group has more than one million members, ""pointing to its massive popularity,"" group admin Pavin Chachavalpongpun told the BBC. Mr Chachavalpongpun said the group ""provides a platform for serious discussion on the monarchy and it allows Thais to express their views freely about the monarchy, from the political intervention of the monarchy, to its intimate ties with the military in consolidating the king's power"".The self-exiled academic is based in Japan. A new Facebook group he set up on Monday evening gained more than 400,000 followers over night. Facebook confirmed to the BBC it was ""compelled to restrict access to content which the Thai government has deemed to be illegal"". ""Requests like this are severe, contravene international human rights law, and have a chilling effect on people's ability to express themselves,"" it said in a statement.It said it was preparing a legal challenge. Thailand forcing Facebook to restrict access to the group has also been strongly criticised by rights groups. ""Thailand's government is again abusing its overbroad and rights-abusing laws to force Facebook to restrict content that is protected by the human right to free speech,"" John Sifton, Asia Advocacy Director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. ""Make no mistake, it is Thailand that is breaking the law here - international law protecting freedom of expression.""Mr Chachavalpongpun told the BBC the discussions in the group were ""critical of the monarchy"". ""Some members think a constitutional monarchy may still work, but this is the minority. Some think an urgent monarchical reform is needed."" He is one of three dissidents the Thai government has warned its people to stay away from. The other two are British journalist Andrew MacGregor Marshall who has published a book critical of the Thai monarchy and Thai political history professor Somsak Jeamteerasakul who is an outspoken critic of the monarchy and lives in exile in France. The students risking it all to challenge the monarchyThai police arrest nine in sweep against activistsWhy young people are protesting in ThailandThailand's monarchy has long been shielded from criticism under strict lese-majeste and other laws which punish insult to the royal family with up to 15 years in jail.Thais are taught to revere the monarchy from a young age.But that taboo was broken in recent weeks when some activists started publicly calling for reforms to the monarchy - amid wider anti-government protests.""I think they have pushed the ceiling of the discussion on the monarchy very high and they will continue to do so,"" Mr Chachavalpongpun told the BBC.  ""The government tried to shut them up by using legal tools such as arresting the core leaders and blocking access to my group. If the students persist, a harsher measure might be taken, like a crackdown.""Thai police last week arrested nine people over the protests. "
225,Former headmaster admits sexual abuse in Aberdeen and Thailand,"A former headmaster has admitted subjecting a girl to a catalogue of sexual abuse in Aberdeen and Asia.Arthur Hutchinson, 74, began targeting the victim when she was aged eight in Thailand, and continued when she moved to Scotland to pursue higher education.The High Court in Edinburgh heard she did not resist as she was afraid Hutchinson would withdraw financial support from her family and stop her education.Sentence was deferred until next month.After an argument the victim went to see a counsellor in the city and revealed that she had been sexually abused.After arresting Hutchinson, police seized a laptop which contained videos and images the victim.He admitted a total of five charges.Hutchinson was a school teacher for more than 40 years and latterly was employed as the headmaster of a secondary school in West Yorkshire, before retiring in 2008.The first offender went abroad to live two years later and settled in Thailand and began abusing the child.The judge, Lord Fairley, deferred sentence on Hutchinson for the preparation of a background report, including a risk assessment.He remanded Hutchinson in jail and placed him on the sex offenders register."
226,Thai protests: Lawyer Anon Nampa among nine arrested in sweep against activists,"Thai police have arrested nine people in a sweep targeting activists involved in recent anti-government protests.Among the nine was lawyer Anon Nampa, who was charged over a Harry Potter-themed protest in Bangkok at which he called for reform of the monarchy.Thailand's monarchy has long been shielded from criticism under strict lese-majeste and other laws.But in recent weeks, students and other activists have taken to the streets to call for reforms of the institution.Mr Anon, 36, was the first to openly break the taboo at the protest, which took place earlier this month.Among the others detained after Mr Anon were activists Baramee Chairat, Suwanna Tarnlek and Korakot Saengyenpanm, and two popular rappers: Dechatorn Bamroongmuang, from the group Rap for Democracy; and Thanayut Na Ayutthaya, better known as Elevenfinger, both of whom performed on stage at a July protest at Bangkok's Democracy Monument.The activists were charged with sedition and could face prison sentences of up to seven years. All were later released on bail. Activists said they had seen a police list of 20 more facing possible arrest in the near future.The protesters are demanding dissolution of the government headed by Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former army chief who seized power in a 2014 military coup and returned as the country's civilian premier after a controversial election last year.The students risking it all to challenge the monarchyWhy young people are protesting in ThailandThe anti-government rallies took an unprecedented turn earlier this month when they began to include calls for reform to the monarchy.Thais are taught to respect, revere and love the monarchy, but also to fear the consequences of speaking about it.Insulting the monarchy in Thailand can mean up to 15 years in jail under the kingdom's lese-majeste law.The use of this legislation has slowed in recent years as Thai King Vajiralongkorn has let it be known he no longer wants it so widely used. But observers say the government has used other legal routes to target dissent, including the sedition law.Mr Anon's arrest on Wednesday saw him charged with sedition for a second time this month. He was earlier arrested over the July rally with another activist, Panupong Jaadnok.This latest arrest is over the Harry Potter-themed protest that took place in Bangkok on 3 August, where Mr Anon had stressed that he wanted to reform, not overthrow, the constitutional monarchy.He focused in particular on the huge assets of the Crown Property Bureau which, under the late King Bhumibol, had been notionally held in trust for the benefit of the Thai people, but have now been declared the personal property of the king, making him by far the wealthiest person in Thailand.Mr Anon also questioned King Vajiralongkorn's decision to take personal command of all military units based in Bangkok, something he believes cannot be compatible with a democratic, constitutional monarchy.""It had to be done,"" he said of his call for accountability.""That's why I chose to speak candidly, to honour my own integrity, the integrity of the audience, and out of respect for the monarchy. Because if we don't speak frankly about it, then we will never understand it.""His comments were nothing short of extraordinary in a country where few dare to openly discuss the institution. In recent years, critics of Thailand's monarchy who have fled to neighbouring countries have been abducted and murdered.Thai police are cracking down on the student-led movement that has given rise to the country's biggest rallies since the coup six years ago.Protesters seek the resignation of the military-backed government, an end to the harassment of its critics, a new constitution and fresh elections.""The Thai government's repeated promises to listen to dissenting voices have proven meaningless as the crackdown on pro-democracy activists continues unabated,"" said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, calling for authorities to drop the charges and release all the activists. Ming Yu Hah, Amnesty International's Deputy Regional Director for Campaigns, accused the Thai authorities of ""weaponising the law to silence people who peacefully criticise the government"". ""The authorities must drop these bogus charges against peaceful protesters,"" he said. ""Freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly are human rights, even if the government disagrees with the criticisms being levelled at them."""

228,Thai protests: Thousands gather in Bangkok to demand reforms,"Thousands of protesters staged another anti-government rally in the Thai capital, Bangkok, on Sunday to demand political reforms.Demonstrators want a revised constitution and are also calling for reform of the monarchy - a sensitive subject in Thailand. Under Thai law, anyone criticising the royal family faces long prison sentences.There have been almost daily student-led demonstrations in recent weeks. Several protest leaders have been arrested. But organisers said they hoped Sunday's rally would show broader support for change beyond the student groups. Bangkok police said on Sunday evening that about 10,000 attended the protest.""We want a new election and a new parliament from the people,"" 24-year-old student activist Patsalawalee Tanakitwiboonpon told the cheering crowd.""Lastly, our dream is to have a monarchy which is truly under the constitution.""The students risking it all to challenge the monarchyWhy young Thais are protestingThailand's lese-majeste law explained Observers said Sunday's protest at Bangkok's Democracy Monument was one of the biggest anti-government demonstrations since Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha took power in a 2014 coup.They waved banners and chanted: ""Down with dictatorship, long live democracy.""The protesters are demanding that Mr Prayuth - a former general who won disputed elections last year - stand down.The BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok says recent inclusion of the monarchy in the protesters' demands has electrified the debate.About 600 police officers were monitoring the protest.Nearby, dozens of supporters of the monarchy also staged a rally.Last year's elections were the first since the military seized power in 2014 and for many young people they were seen as an opportunity for change.But the military had taken steps to entrench its political role, and the election saw Mr Prayuth re-installed.Mr Prayuth says the majority of Thais do not support the protesters.The latest wave of protests began in February after the pro-democracy Future Forward Party (FFP) was dissolved by court order.Protests were held, but were quickly halted by Covid-19 restrictions.Tensions increased in June when Wanchalearm Satsaksit, a prominent activist who had been living in Cambodia in exile since 2014, went missing. The Thai government has denied any involvement in his disappearance.Student-led protests erupted again on 18 July, despite a ban of mass gatherings under the country's state of emergency. Rallies have been held almost daily since then.Last week, prominent student leader Parit Chiwarak, 22, was arrested and faces charges including sedition, assault and holding an event that could spread a disease."
229,Backpacker's family 'grateful' for Thai king's clemency,"The family of a British backpacker killed in Thailand have welcomed a decision to commute his murderers' death sentences to life in prison.Two Burmese workers were sentenced to death in 2015, after being found guilty of killing David Miller, 24, of Jersey, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, of Norfolk.Their sentences have been reviewed to commemorate King Vajiralongkorn's birthday and to show his ""clemency"".Mr Miller's family said they were ""grateful"" to the Thai king.The bodies of Mr Miller and Miss Witheridge were found on a beach on the Thai island of Koh Tao in 2014.Lin and Phyo (also known as Win Zaw Htun) were sentenced to death for the murder of Mr Miller and the murder and rape of Ms Witheridge.In a statement, Ian and Sue Miller, who have campaigned against the death penalty, said: ""We are grateful to His Majesty the King of Thailand for showing his clemency to the murderers of our son David.""Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo finally admitted to the rape and murder of Hannah Witheridge and the murder of our son.""""The final admittance of their guilt has allowed this act of clemency to become possible,"" they continued.The family said it had brought to a close a ""lengthy and disturbing period"" where activists on social media had attempted to influence justice in Thailand and public opinion elsewhere. ""But in the end the truth has been revealed,"" the couple added.However, a lawyer for Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo told the BBC that the pair had not admitted their guilt when their death sentences were commuted. They still maintain their innocence, as they did throughout the trial.A royal commutation does not require an admission of guilt, says the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok. Miss Witheridge, a University of Essex student from Hemsby in Norfolk, and Mr Miller, a civil and structural engineering graduate, from Jersey, were bludgeoned to death.A post-mortem examination showed she had been raped. Mr and Mrs Miller, from St Helier, said: ""Every moment we miss our son. ""Our thoughts are also with the Witheridge family and the tragic loss of their daughter. ""We hope that these two murderers will now spend a very, very long time in jail where they cannot harm other families and will have time to reflect on the consequences of their acts.""The two men were convicted and sentenced in 2015 and the verdict was upheld by an appeals court in 2017 and the Supreme Court in August 2019.The convictions were mired in controversy, with supporters of the two men arguing they had been framed because their initial confessions were made under duress.A royal decree said the sentences had been reviewed to commemorate King Vajiralongkorn's birthday on 28 July and to ""illustrate the king's clemency""."
230,Thai king commutes death sentence of UK pair’s killers,"Two men given the death penalty for killing two British backpackers in Thailand have had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment.The bodies of David Miller, 24, from Jersey, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, from Norfolk, were found on a beach on the Thai island of Koh Tao in 2014. Burmese nationals Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were convicted in a Thai court and sentenced to death in December 2015.Lin and Phyo will serve life sentences instead following a royal decree. Ms Witheridge, a University of Essex student from Hemsby in Norfolk, and Mr Miller, a civil and structural engineering graduate, from Jersey, were bludgeoned to death.A post-mortem examination showed Ms Witheridge had been raped.

This was later changed to clarify that their death sentences had been commuted to life imprisonment."
231,Thai protests: Student leader Parit Chiwarak arrested on sedition charges,"Thai police have detained a prominent student leader amid a growing movement calling for political reforms.Parit Chiwarak, 22, was arrested on the outskirts of Bangkok for taking part in a demonstration last month. Students have held regular protests since then.They are calling for a new constitution including changes to tough laws banning defamation of the monarchy.Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former general, says the majority of Thais do not support the protesters.The students risking it all to challenge the monarchyWhy young Thais are protestingThailand's lese-majeste law explained Mr Parit's arrest on Friday was broadcast live on social media by a friend. The footage shows police reading several charges before he is bundled into a car, shouting: ""Long live democracy.""Police Major General Somprasong Yentaum told the AFP news agency: ""I can confirm that Parit Chiwarak has been arrested... The charges relate to the demonstration on 18 July.""He faces charges including sedition, assault and holding an event that could spread a disease. Two other protest leaders were arrested on similar charges last Friday, but were later released on bail.The protesters - who are calling for the dissolution of parliament and a new constitution curtailing the political role of the monarchy - have often uses the three-fingered salute from the Hunger Games films. Thailand has a long history of political unrest, but a new wave of protests began in February, after the pro-democracy Future Forward Party (FFP) was dissolved by court order.It had received the third-largest share of seats in elections a year earlier and was particularly popular with young voters.Many saw the poll - the first since the military seized power in 2014 - as a chance for change after years of military rule.But the election saw Mr Prayuth - the former military leader who led the coup - re-installed as prime minister. Protests were held, but were quickly halted by Covid-19 restrictions.Tensions were revived in June when Wanchalearm Satsaksit, a prominent activist had been living in Cambodia in exile since 2014, went missing. The Thai government has denied any involvement in his disappearance.Students-led protests erupted again on 18 July, despite a ban of mass gatherings under the country's state of emergency.  Rallies have been held almost daily since then.The army commander, General Apirat Kongsompong, suggested that the protesters were afflicted by ""chung chart"", or ""hatred of the nation""."
232,Thailand protests: Risking it all to challenge the monarchy,"A growing movement among students has been calling for political reform in Thailand. In recent days, the protests have taken a surprising turn, writes an analyst in London for the BBC.On a stage at an out-of-town campus of one of Thailand's top universities, a young woman with wavy long hair and owlish spectacles steps forward, through a dramatic cloud of dry-ice, and reads out a 10-point manifesto to a crowd of cheering students. Her demands, for a monarchy that is accountable to the country's elected institutions, that moderates its use of public funds, stays out of politics and does not exercise control over important army units, would be unremarkable in most countries. In Thailand, they are nothing short of revolutionary.Thais are taught from birth that the monarchy is the keystone that holds the country together, the institution that embodies the national character. Every recent Thai constitution - and there have been 19 in modern times, along with a dozen military coups - has stated, at the top, that ""The King shall be enthroned in a position of revered worship"" and that ""No person shall expose the King to any sort of accusation or action"".Those provisions are backed by article 112 of the criminal code, known as the lese-majeste law, which subjects anyone criticising the royal family to secret trials and long prison sentences. Thailand's lese-majeste law explained More recently, critics who fled to neighbouring countries have been abducted and murdered. Thais are taught to respect, revere and love the monarchy, but also to fear the consequences of speaking about it. The issues raised on that stage at Thammasat University on Monday have, in the past, been discussed openly only by those living safely in exile, far from Thailand, or whispered in the privacy of the home.The Thammasat manifesto has caused an uproar. The students have been accused of ""crossing the line"", of going too far, even by some of those who support their other demands for reform. Senators appointed by the former military junta, and an important political crutch for the government of junta-leader-turned-Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, have called for legal action against the student leaders, for an investigation into how they funded Monday's spectacularly-produced protest, and into which ""dark hand"" instigated the youngsters to come up with such outrageous demands. The powerful army commander, General Apirat Kongsompong, suggested that the protesters were afflicted by ""chung chart"", ""hatred of the nation"", a term used in the past to rally ultra-nationalist Thais against perceived enemies, and a disease, General Apirat told soldiers, that was far worse than Covid-19.The student leader who read out the manifesto, Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul, has since stayed mostly on her campus, planning further rallies, and nervously watching the plain-clothes police who are now constantly monitoring her.Why young people are protesting in ThailandWhat we know of Thailand's King VajiralongkornThe satirist who vanished in broad daylight Worryingly, some ultra-royalists are raising the spectre of October 1976, when police and right-wing vigilantes opened fire on left-wing students inside Thammasat University, killing dozens, lynching some and then battering their bodies. That shockingly brutal attack was provoked by a rumour of a slight by the students against then-Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, the present king.Veterans of the upheavals of 1976 do not believe it will happen again. Former government minister Chaturon Chaiseng, who was among a number of student activists who spent years hiding with communist insurgents after the 1976 massacre, says a repeat of such violence would be very risky today.There are so many grievances against the government at the moment, he says, which the students share with wider Thai society.These protests are happening during an almost perfect storm of bad news for the Thai government. Despite managing an impressive containment of the Covid-19 coronavirus, with no local infections for nearly three months, the collapse of tourism has hit the economy very hard and drawn attention to one of the world's widest gaps between rich and poor. The decision earlier this year to dissolve a dynamic new political party, which had attracted the support of many younger voters, gave them the sense that the military-dominated political system was denying them a voice.That was compounded by the abduction and presumed murder of a Thai activist in Cambodia, blamed by some on elements close to the palace, and then by the dropping of all criminal charges against a member of one of Thailand's wealthiest families over the killing of a police officer in a hit-and-run incident eight years ago. On top of that, since the Covid-19 crisis started King Vajiralongkorn has spent nearly all his time living in a hotel in Germany, prompting a Twitter hashtag #มีกษัตริย์ไว้ทําไม #whydoweneedaking?, which was reposted more than a million times.The protest leaders have been careful to frame their demands within the constitution. The first person to break the taboo, a week before the Thammasat manifesto, was human rights lawyer Anon Nampa, speaking at a Harry Potter-themed protest and looking not unlike the fictional young wizard. He stressed that he wanted to reform, not overthrow, the constitutional monarchy. He focused in particular on the huge assets of the Crown Property Bureau, which, under the late King Bhumibol, had been notionally held in trust for the benefit of the Thai people, but have now been declared the personal property of the king, making him by far the wealthiest person in Thailand. Anon also questioned King Vajiralongkorn's decision to take personal command of all military units based in Bangkok, something he believes cannot be compatible with a democratic, constitutional monarchy. ""It had to be done,"" he said of his call for accountability. ""That's why I chose to speak candidly, to honour my own integrity, the integrity of the audience, and out of respect for the monarchy. Because if we don't speak frankly about it, then we will never understand it.""Anon Nampa and another activist, Panupong Jaadnok, have since been arrested on charges of breaking Thailand's sweeping sedition law, an alternative to the lese majeste law which, the King has let it be known, he no longer wants to be so widely used. But far from silencing talk about the monarchy, their demands have now been taken up by a student movement which has been agitating for change for many months, and which is active in campuses across the country, and includes high-school students as well.We spoke to two young political science students who have become involved in the movement, both thoughtful and articulate, with hopes of good careers after university. Yet their comments about the monarchy, although expressed with moderation and reason, would have been unthinkable even a year ago.""This generation knows for a fact that the monarchy is involved in politics and that affects the lives of the Thai people,"" said one. ""So it is fair and democratic for us to talk about anyone involved in politics, whether it is the military or the monarchy.""""We have to try to start talking about it, making it a new norm in society to talk about the monarchy,"" said the other. ""I think the silent majority want to talk about it, because if you don't touch something, if you don't reform it, it will go rotten and collapse.""There are young people on the other side, though how many is hard to gauge right now. The potential for clashes, contrived or spontaneous, is real. At a small pro-monarchy demonstration in Bangkok's historic royal quarter this month a student told the BBC that ""the three pillars of this country, nation, religion and monarchy, must be revered, not brought down to be played with like this. That's not the right way under a constitutional monarchy.""""We're not coming out to fight with them. We have come out to show the power of the other side. Thailand has a long history. It cannot be brought down by those who want to defame the monarchy,"" they said. This is uncharted territory for Thailand, and no-one knows what will happen next. The government, comprised mostly of conservative, military and royalist figures, seems uncertain how it should respond. An over-harsh reaction risks angering a public already frustrated over other issues. Yet it cannot be seen to be failing to defend the monarchy.""The genie is out of the bottle,"" says Professor Thongchai Winichakul, a historian at the University of Wisconsin and another survivor of the 1976 massacre. ""Society won't stop, change won't stop. The only thing we can do is to take care that the change takes place with as little bloodshed as possible. Thais have been gossiping about the monarchy in private for years, then teaching their children to praise it lavishly in public, to be hypocrites. All these young protesters have done is bring that gossip out into the open.""The lese majeste and other laws and the threat they pose to BBC staff limits some of our reporting that relates directly to members of the Thai royal family."

236,Thailand calls for new probe in Red Bull heir hit-and-run case,"Thailand's attorney general has ordered a new investigation into the heir to the Red Bull energy drink fortune over the hit-and-run killing of a policeman.Prosecutors said new evidence showed that Vorayuth Yoovidhaya was driving much faster than first believed and might have had cocaine in his system, allowing them to reopen the case.It comes after previous charges were dropped last month, sparking outrage.Mr Vorayuth is accused of hitting the officer with his car in 2012.Police Sergeant-Major Wichian Klanprasert was riding his motorbike in the Thai capital Bangkok when he was hit by a grey Ferrari, which dragged his body more than 100m (109yds) down the road, before driving off. The untouchable Red Bull heir in ThailandLife and death on Thailand's lethal roadsWho was Red Bull co-founder Chaleo?The Red Bull heir repeatedly failed to meet with police to face charges, which included reckless driving causing death. Mr Vorayuth's lawyers denied the allegations. He left Thailand in 2017 and his whereabouts are currently unknown. Last month, officials announced that all charges against the 38-year-old had been dropped. The decision sparked outrage, and the police, government and attorney general's office said they would investigate.In a press conference on Tuesday, the Attorney General's Office said new evidence meant that the case could be reopened.It said the speed of the Ferrari at the time of the accident had previously been put at 80km/h (50 mph), but an expert opinion not included in the police report had determined that the speed was closer to 170km/h.""This is new evidence according to the law,"" said a spokesman for the office.Mr Vorayuth could also face a new charge relating to drug use. Blood tests following the accident showed traces of cocaine in his system, but prosecutors say he was not charged at the time because of a possible false positive from medication he had allegedly taken.Mr Vorayuth is the grandson of Chaleo Yoovidhaya, who co-founded the Red Bull empire. At the time of his death in 2012, Chaleo was the third richest person in Thailand, according to Forbes magazine, with a net worth of $5bn (£3.93bn).The case against Mr Vorayuth has been closely watched in Thailand, and has fuelled criticism that the country's elite enjoy special treatment by the authorities."
237,Kirsty Jones: Days remain to find backpacker's killer,"Police investigating the murder of a Welsh backpacker in Thailand have just seven days left to find her killer.Kirsty Jones, 23, from Tredomen, near Brecon in Powys, was raped and strangled at a guesthouse in Thailand in August 2000.Dyfed-Powys Police officers have been to the scene in Chiang Mai to help with the investigation.But they only have a week before the 20-year Thai statute of limitations runs out on 10 August.The Liverpool University graduate was three months into a two-year around the world trip when she was killed.Thai murder DNA 'breakthrough' hopeUnder Thai law, officers only have 20 years to charge someone with an offence, which if convicted may be punishable by death, life imprisonment or a 20-year jail term.Dyfed-Powys Police said its officers had met with investigators in Chiang Mai ""to obtain information on their investigation, and assist with the forensic examination of exhibits"".""Dyfed-Powys Police is aware of the expiry of the Thai 20-year statute of limitations and the investigation continues with this firmly in mind,"" a spokesman said.Farmer's daughter Ms Jones was found dead in a room at the Aree guest house in Chiang Mai in northern Thailand, 435 miles (700km) north of Bangkok.Despite a number of arrests and a £10,000 reward for information, no-one has ever been charged with her murder.In a previous interview, her mother Sue Jones said the family knew it was ""unlikely much will change"" or that ""anyone would come forwards"".""I just hope we did everything that we could for Kirsty, and that after 20 years she will be able to rest in peace,"" she said."
238,Why a new generation of Thais are protesting against the government,"They're young, they're angry, and they're calling for change.Thailand's youth were among thousands on the streets of Bangkok last week in one of the biggest anti-government protests the capital has seen in years, despite a coronavirus ban on large gatherings. They say they will continue protesting if their three main demands are not met - for parliament to be dissolved, for the constitution to be rewritten, and for authorities to stop harassing critics.Many have found creative ways to protest - including the use of a Japanese anime character and a ""Hunger Games"" salute. Thailand has a long history of political unrest and protest, but a new wave began in February this year, after a popular opposition political party was ordered to dissolve. March 2019 saw the first elections since the military seized power in 2014. For many young people and first-time voters, it was seen as a chance for change after years of military rule. But the military had taken steps to entrench its political role, and the election saw Prayuth Chan-ocha - the military leader who led the coup - re-installed as prime minister.The pro-democracy Future Forward Party (FFP), with its charismatic leader Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, garnered the third-largest share of seats and was particularly popular with young, first-time voters. Thai pro-democracy party dissolved over loanBut in February, a court ruled FFP had received a loan from Thanathorn which was deemed a donation - thus making it illegal - and the party was forced to disband. Thousands joined street protests, but these were halted by Covid-19 restrictions.Things heated up again in June when a prominent pro-democracy activist went missing.Wanchalearm Satsaksit, who had been living in Cambodia in exile since 2014, was reportedly grabbed off the street and bundled off into a vehicle.The satirist who vanished in broad daylight Protesters accused the Thai state of orchestrating his kidnapping, which the police and government have denied.Punchada Sirivunnabood, a professor of politics at Mahidol University, says this combination of events has driven the new wave of protest.""The students feel like what the government has done is not really democratic. They want a fair government,"" she told the BBC.Disillusioned by years of military rule, protesters are now demanding amendments to the constitution, a new election, the prime minister's resignation and an end to the harassment of rights activists. The protests are technically banned under Thailand's coronavirus state of emergency - and breaking this ban carries a sentence of up to two years in jail. The movement is largely leaderless, but driven by a group known as the Free Youth.This group, says Dr Aim Sinpeng at the University of Sydney, is ""loosely composed of a number of university student associations and affiliated groups… [there's] no leader on purpose"".She says they've learned from the Hong Kong protests of recent years, ""where these groups represent free individuals that come together rather than being anchored down by particular organisations or political parties"".Pro-democracy - and anti-China - protesters in Thailand, Hong Kong and Taiwan have even dubbed themselves the ""Milk Tea Alliance"" - after the classic drink loved in all three places.And the Thais have found creative - and sometimes whimsical - methods of protest. A Japanese hamster character, for example, has been turned into a rebel symbol. Protesters have taken the Hamtaro theme song and changed its lyrics, using it as an anti-government anthem.A line in the song which says ""the most delicious food is sunflower seeds"" has been changed to ""the most delicious food is taxpayers' money"".Protesters have also been seen giving a three-fingered salute, a gesture taken from the Hunger Games film franchise where it's a rousing symbol of defiance against an authoritarian state. ""Thai youths have always used more subversive pop culture forms of discontent,"" Dr Sinpeng says.""That's because of years of living in repressive environments that do not always allow for freedom of expression. [They're] having to always find creative ways to get around all kinds of censorship.""As well as in Bangkok, small ""flashmob"" type protests which are easy to organise and can quickly disperse are being organised in smaller cities, driven by social media. ""Twitter has really gained ground in the past few years,"" says Dr Sinpeng. ""The trending hashtags are not only important for mobilising public participation, but it is also a branding exercise for a movement that is still forming with evolving and dynamic identities.""According to Prof Punchada, part of the issue is about the older generation not understanding what the students want. ""Most of them support this government, but the young people have opposite ideas.""Unlike previous conflicts between the Red and Yellow shirts - supporters of opposing political factions in Thailand - ""this conflict is between the older and younger generation,"" she says.Who are Thailand's reds and yellows?""There [have been] off remarks from senior officials that are patronising and demonstrate a deeply-held belief among some older sections of the population that 'kids should not defy their elders',"" says Dr Sinpeng. ""[The youth] want to know the elders running the country hear them and take their concerns seriously. They want respect."" Back on the streets, a real fight continues to brew - but is this protest wave likely to have much impact? ""The protests are not going to shake up the government too much now as they are not at the scale that they could yet,"" says Dr Sinpeng. ""[They] are notable, but will require more momentum."""
239,Thai gay activists raise Pride flags in Bangkok,"Hundreds of Thai gay activists have raised rainbow flags in Bangkok during a pro-democracy rally in the capital. They danced and sang in the city centre, where police were deployed. There were no reports of any violence.Saturday's rally was the latest in a series of youth-led protests calling for the government to resign.General Prayuth Chan-ocha seized power in a coup in 2014, and was later named as prime minister by the military-appointed parliament.""We're here today mainly to call for democracy. Once we achieve democracy, equal rights will follow,"" a young protester told Reuters. He said that LGBT groups in Thailand ""do not yet have equal rights in society, so we're calling for both democracy and equality"".In recent days Thai pro-democracy activists have been defying a government ban on public gatherings amid an ongoing coronavirus outbreak in the country in south-east Asia.The Thai satirist abducted in broad daylightGay couple win custody battle against Thai surrogate mother"
240,Charges dropped against Red Bull heir over policeman death,"Charges have been dropped against Red Bull heir Vorayuth Yoovidhaya over the 2012 hit-and-run killing of a police officer. Mr Yoovidhaya was accused of hitting the officer with his car in the capital, Bangkok, then fleeing.He repeatedly failed to meet police to face the charges, which include reckless driving causing death.Thai Police say these charges have now been dropped, but it is unclear why.Mr Vorayuth is the grandson of Chaleo Yoovidhaya, who co-founded the Red Bull empire with Austrian Dietrich Mateschitz. At the time of his death in 2012, Chaleo was the third richest person in Thailand, according to Forbes magazine, with a net worth of $5bn (£3.93bn).The untouchable Red Bull heir in ThailandPolice Sergeant-Major Wichian Klanprasert was riding his motorbike along Bangkok's Sukhumvit Road when he was hit by a grey Ferrari, which dragged his body more than 100m (109yds) down the road, before driving off.Investigating officers followed a trail of brake fluid to a luxury home less than a kilometre away. The badly-dented Ferrari was there, but initially the police detained a driver employed by the family as their main suspect.When they subsequently discovered the car had actually been driven by Mr Vorayuth, then 27,  he was tested and found to have excessive alcohol in his blood - but, he said, this was from drinking at home after the accident.He was arrested but then released shortly afterwards. Subsequently, he was summoned repeatedly to face charges, but each time his lawyers said he was unable to do so, citing overseas work commitments and illness. An initial investigation team had to be disbanded after an officer was accused of covering up for Mr Vorayuth's involvement.Thai authorities finally issued an arrest warrant for Mr Vorayuth five years after the accident, after he missed eight legal summons.The closely watched case has fuelled criticism that Thailand's elite enjoy special treatment by the authorities."
241,F1 2020: Alex Albon's make or break year in a rollercoaster career?,"As Formula 1 emerges from a long shutdown, few will be more impatient to get back on track than one of the sport's rising stars Alex Albon. 2020 represents his big chance to make it to the top of F1, but with huge opportunity comes huge pressure.   Radio 1 Newsbeat chatted to the 23-year-old just before lockdown and it was clear that he's more than up for the challenge. ""It's an opportunity to show everyone what I can do,"" he says.At the start of the 2019 season he lived through the the moment every young racing driver dreams of - his first race in F1. Smiling at the memory, Alex remembers how nervous he was before making his debut in Australia as one of the world's 20 best racers. Back then, he wouldn't have believed anyone who told him just how well his first season would pan out.""I'd have said you were drunk!"" Alex jokes.Many F1 drivers have to wait years to get a drive with one of the big teams which have a chance of winning races. Some never get that opportunity. It took Alex just 12 Grand Prixs.  But the path to success has been far from straightforward for the British-Thai driver, who only last year moved away from his family home in Milton Keynes, before returning to live with them in lockdown.Eight years ago, he came close to quitting motorsport altogether, when he was dropped from Red Bull's young driver programme. But thanks to financial backing from sponsors and his mum's home country of Thailand he was able to keep his racing career alive. After years of hard work climbing the notoriously tough motorsport ladder, he bounced back from that early disappointment to make it to Formula 2, the F1 feeder series in 2017. But despite two years of doing well at F2 level, last winter he had to wait a long time to find out if he'd impressed Red Bull bosses enough for them to invite him back in to the fold, with their F1 sister team, then called Toro Rosso. ""To be honest that winter was one of the most restless of my life, just kind of not knowing what to expect,"" Alex tells Newsbeat.""I was... pooing myself, would be the right word for it!"" Alex took full advantage of his big F1 break and didn't stay in the other team for long.Its main team is led by Max Verstappen. The Dutchman is one of the fastest and most exciting drivers on the grid. Few doubt that he's destined for world titles. Max's 2019 teammate, Pierre Gasly, simply couldn't keep up with him. It meant Red Bull decided to swap the drivers, promoting Alex to the main team and demoting Pierre for the second half of the year. Alex impressed enough to keep the seat alongside Max for the 2020 season - a spectacular rise through the motorsport ranks.  ""It's been a crazy 12 months. Nothing I could have imagined,"" he says. ""It still feels weird now to be honest. But here I am.""If results are good enough this season, it could be the start of a long career at the front F1, potentially even fighting for world championships. If he doesn't stay close to Max's pace, there's a chance he could be dropped and his F1 career could be over. Alex says: ""Being a two man sport, you're always going to get compared to your team mate. It's about ignoring that, trying to put that all to one side because it is very easy to fall into a mental hole. ""I know Max is very quick. At the same time, I want to do my own job. I want to have good results.""""It's quite normal in Formula 1, in motorsports,"" Alex adds. ""It's a very cut-throat environment where every year could be your last.""  Alex is the first Thai Formula 1 driver since Birabongse Bhanudej, whose last F1 race was in 1954. Alex has a Thai Mum and a British Dad, but chose to race under a Thai flag. It means he's helping to raise the sport's profile there.""I stand in pride,"" he says. ""Motorsport in Thailand isn't actually that big. ""It's improving and last year made a big step forward. Hopefully we can have a race there, that would be my my dream.""Alex talks about his last trip to Thailand in the autumn. ""Suddenly, there were billboards and trains stickered up with my face on. I'm quite shy, so to see all that was a bit of a shock.""It's weird. I'm sure the likes of Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen get used to it, but when you first see, it feels like 'Oh god why am I on there!?'"" This year will be the biggest test Alex has ever faced in his motorsport career, but at least he'll have some friendly faces around him.Last year, McLaren's Lando Norris and Williams driver George Russell were also new to the sport, which was comforting for Alex. The three regularly travelled to races together and have become good mates. ""Me and George grew up together, we raced against each other. Lando was a bit of a younger generation compared to George and I, but we've kind of come into this whole world together. ""When you're racing against people like Lewis Hamilton or Sebastian Vettel, these guys are the titans of the sport. ""But at the same time, you look across your shoulder and you're like, 'Oh it's George and Lando'. It's nice to have other rookies that you can hang out with.""Alex says he usually spends more time in F1 than he does with his own family. But it's rare for drivers at this level to be firm friends, on or off track. ""I think the younger generation are a bit more open to being friends. ""It's not to say, when we put the helmet on that we're still mates, we're definitely not mates when we have our helmets on - that's just the way it is.""Alex actually hit Lando while overtaking him at the Japanese Grand Prix last year, so did they just go to the pub after the race and chat about it?""I'm not sure there are many pubs in Japan. We could have gone to a karaoke night maybe!""Of course, Lando wasn't happy, but I apologised and there's no hard feelings. ""We all know that we're here to do a job and get results.""Alex is still finding his feet at Red Bull. He's polite and mild-mannered, but clearly not short of confidence in his own ability. More than used to battling against the odds, Alex insists he can cope with the pressure that F1 2020 will bring.""Once you put on the helmet and you're in the car, all that pressure suddenly goes away. You're in the seat, you're the pilot.""It's what I've been doing all my life. That's when I feel the most confident.""

242,Wanchalearm Satsaksit: The Thai satirist abducted in broad daylight,"Sitanan Satsaksit was on the phone to her brother early in the evening on 4 June when he told her to hold the line. Wanchalearm, also known as Tar, was handing over a few dollars for meatballs at a stall opposite his home in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh.Then Sitanan heard noise coming from the other end of the line.""I heard a loud bang. At first I thought he had a car accident as he shouted 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe,'"" she tells the BBC. Sitanan could hear the screams of her brother as men shouted in Khmer, a language she doesn't understand. But her brother had not been hit by a car - he was being kidnapped. Witnesses at the scene say they saw a group of armed men bundling Wanchalearm into a black SUV. As he shouted for help in Khmer, some people started moving towards him, but the armed abductors warned them to back off, before speeding away. Confused and terrified, Sitanan could hear the muffled voice of her brother for another 30 minutes. Then the line went dead.A friend of Wanchalearm made some inquiries for her.""Twenty minutes later, this person called me back to say: 'Keep calm sister, Tar was abducted,'"" she recalls. Wanchalearm Satsaksit, 37, a prominent Thai pro-democracy activist who had lived in exile in Cambodia since 2014, has not been seen since. He is the ninth exiled critic of Thailand's military and monarchy to become a victim of enforced disappearance in recent years.A popular and colourful character, Wanchalearm's activism started more than a decade ago, primarily focusing on gender and LGBT rights in Thailand. Over time, his interest started to shift to broader calls for democracy in the country, says Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher for Human Rights Watch Asia and friend of Wanchalearm.By the time of the 2014 military coup led by General Prayuth Chan-ocha, Wanchalearm was affiliated with the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD), also known as the Red Shirts. The group was first formed in 2006 to oppose an earlier military coup which overthrew then prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra.Wanchalearm was angered by what he saw as yet another affront to democracy by the military in 2014. The new junta wasted little time in rooting out its critics. Soon after the coup, Wanchalearm's face appeared on TV and he was called to attend a meeting at a military camp, Sunai says. He didn't turn up. Wanchalearm knew this meant he needed to flee his homeland and start a new life in Cambodia. Once in Phnom Penh, Wanchalearm settled into his new surroundings. But while he had swapped the dangers of Thailand for relative safety in the leafy outskirts of the Cambodian capital, he was still building up an online following in his homeland through his witty takedowns of the Thai government.""He sees himself as a satirist, almost like a political comedian,"" Sunai says. ""He made fun continuously of the military junta. He made fun of Gen Prayuth, who at that time was leader of the coup group, he made fun of other generals.""He exposed what he considered to be stupid blunders of the junta using the dialect of north-easterners,"" he adds. ""Most of them are poor and he is from that region. He did it to show that a commoner can make fun of those in power. That seemed to be the way of getting even with the oppressors."" But his playful poking did not go unnoticed. In June 2018, Thai authorities issued an arrest warrant for Wanchalearm based on allegations he violated the Computer-Related Crime Act - which criminalises writing that incites unrest - through his Facebook page. The police vowed to bring him back to Thailand.Thailand's disappeared Karen activist and the burned villageWanchalearm was just one of many Thai exiles speaking out from the perceived safety of a neighbouring country. But in reality, doing so is becoming increasingly perilous.At least eight other pro-democracy activists have disappeared since the 2014 coup. The bodies of exiled critics Chatcharn Buppawan and Kraidej Luelert were found disembowelled and stuffed with concrete along the Mekong River border with Laos last year. The Thai army says it had no knowledge of what had happened.Jakrapob Penkair, who served as government spokesman under Thaksin Shinawatra, has been living in exile since 2009 after he says he received a tip-off that he was to be killed. He has known Wanchalearm for many years. Speaking to the BBC from an undisclosed location, Jakrapob says he was shocked by his friend's disappearance due to the light-hearted nature of his activism. He sees almost no chance that Wanchalearm is still alive. ""I think the message is: 'Let's kill these folks. These are outsiders, these are people who are different from us and they should be killed in order to bring Thailand back to normalcy,'"" he says. ""But nothing could be more wrong in that interpretation. I believe their decision to kidnap and murder Tar, and others before him, has been subconsciously radicalising the people.""Like it or not, I think Tar's disappearance and his murder could be a turning point.""Wanchalearm's disappearance sparked protests in Bangkok, with demonstrators accusing the Thai government of involvement, while demanding the Cambodian government investigate the case fully. Posters of Wanchalearm and other disappeared activists have been cropping up around the city.#SaveWanchalearm was trending on Thai Twitter in the days following his abduction.The hashtag ""#abolish112"" was also written or retweeted more than 450,000 times. This is a reference to Article 112 of Thailand's criminal code, which states: ""Whoever defames, insults or threatens the King, Queen, Heir-Apparent or Regent shall be punished with imprisonment of three to 15 years"". Some of the disappeared dissidents were accused of violating the article. Any public questioning of the monarchy in Thailand was until recently almost unheard of. Many activists believe this abduction is linked to the palace, but the strict laws against any negative comment on the monarchy make this a dangerous link to explore or investigate.How Thailand forbids insult of its royaltyDespite widespread outrage over the kidnapping of Wanchalearm, few are holding out much hope for his return. ""The abduction is not for money, it's not a private matter. There is no need to keep him alive,"" says Somyot Pruksakasemsuk, a prominent activist who served seven years in jail on charges of lese majeste - or ""insulting the monarchy"" - and defamation.""The objective of kidnapping is to kill him and to create the atmosphere of fear in Thailand and other countries where [Thai] people are active in criticising the monarchy,"" adds Somyot, whose daughter was once in a long-term relationship with Wanchalearm.  Somyot was in little doubt as to who was behind the disappearance.""The government knows very well about this kidnap and disappearance. I can insist that the government are the ones behind this violation,"" he says. Thai government spokeswoman Narumon Pinyosinwat told the BBC: ""We have no idea what happened to him.""We don't do anything in that category of invading into other countries. They have their own law and control,"" she said.""The person who can answer that question best should be the government of Cambodia because they know what happened in that country to this person.""In response to questions raised by opposition politicians in parliament, Thai Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai said that Wanchalearm did not have political refugee status, so Thailand had to wait for Cambodia to finish its investigation.The spokesman of the Cambodian interior ministry did not respond to requests for comment. A justice ministry spokesman told Voice of Democracy last week that investigations are under way to ascertain ""whether the news is true or not"".Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said: ""Cambodia and Laos have obviously decided to look the other way as now nine prominent Thai exiles have been abducted, and likely killed, by unknown men.""The Thai government is pursuing a ""quid pro quo"" with its two neighbours, he said, accusing Bangkok of making Thailand ""off limits"" to Cambodian opposition figures.""You can be sure there will be more refugees on the chopping block unless governments around the world start publicly demanding answers and accountability from leaders of these three rights abusing governments,"" he said. Sunai Phasuk says Cambodia must investigate fully what has happened to Wanchalearm if it expects to be seen as a country that has ""improved from a lawless society into a country with due process"".""A crime like this cannot happen in broad daylight. This is a test case for Cambodia,"" he says. But Sitanan has little hope of ever seeing Wanchalearm alive again and is just trying to make sense of why someone would want to kill her younger brother.""I want to know if someone has his own opinion, does he need to be so severely punished?"" she asks. ""He didn't rob anyone, he didn't rape anyone. He just thinks differently. Do you really need to kill him?"""

245,"Thailand seafood fraudsters sentenced to 1,446 years in jail","A court in Thailand has sentenced two owners of a restaurant to 1,446 years in prison each for defrauding the public. Last year, Laemgate seafood restaurant launched a pay-in-advance food promotion online.Up to 20,000 people purchased 50 million Thai baht (£1.2m; $1.6m) worth of vouchers, said broadcaster Thai PBS.But the company later said it could not keep up with demand and shut down the restaurant.Apichart Bowornbancharak and Prapassorn Bowornbancha were arrested after hundreds of people complained. It is not uncommon for those found guilty of fraud in Thailand to be sentenced to such long terms, owing to the number of complaints received. However, Thai law limits jail time for public fraud to 20 years.The Laemgate seafood restaurant had last year begun selling various food vouchers that required customers to pay in advance.One such deal offered a seafood meal at 880 baht (£22; $28) for 10 people - far cheaper than their usual prices.Initially, those who bought the vouchers were able to claim their meals at the restaurant but a long waiting list meant an advance booking of up to several months, according to Thai PBS. But by March, the company - Laemgate Infinite - announced its closure, claiming that it could not get hold of enough seafood to meet the demand. It offered to refund customers who had bought vouchers, according to Thai PBS. About 375 out of 818 customers who complained got their money back.Hundreds later filed complaints against the company and its co-owners for fraud. Apichart Bowornbancharak and Prapassorn Bowornbancha were arrested on charges including defrauding the public through false messages.They were found guilty on 723 counts on Wednesday and sentenced to 1,446 years in jail each.They pleaded guilty and their sentences were cut by half to 723 years each. They will in fact only be serving a maximum of 20 years.Their company, Laemgate Infinite, was also fined 1.8m baht, and the co-owners and the company was ordered to refund 2.5m baht in damages to the victims. In 2017, a Thai court sentenced a fraudster to more than 13,000 years in prison. "

247,Coronavirus: Hydroxychloroquine trial begins in the UK,"A trial to see whether two anti-malarial drugs could prevent Covid-19 has begun in Brighton and Oxford.Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine or a placebo will be given to more than 40,000 healthcare workers from Europe, Africa, Asia and South America.All the participants are staff who are in contact with Covid-19 patients.US President Donald Trump was criticised this week after he said he had been taking hydroxychloroquine, despite warnings it might be unsafe.What's the malaria pill Trump's taking?Drug treatment for coronavirus starts UK trialsThe first UK participants in the global trial are being enrolled on Thursday at the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals and the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford.  They will be given either hydroxychloroquine or a placebo for three months. At sites in Asia, participants will be given chloroquine or a placebo.These are the first of a planned 25 UK sites, with results expected by the end of the year. The trial is open to anyone delivering direct care to coronavirus patients in the UK, as long as they have not been diagnosed with Covid-19. It will test whether the drugs can prevent healthcare workers exposed to the virus from contracting it. One of the study's leaders, Prof Nicholas White at the University of Oxford said: ""We really do not know if chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are beneficial or harmful against Covid-19.""But, he said, a randomised controlled trial such as this one, where neither the participant nor the researchers know who has been given the drug or a placebo, was the best way to find out. ""A widely available, safe and effective vaccine may be a long way off,"" said Prof Martin Llewelyn from Brighton and Sussex Medical School, who is also leading the study.  ""If drugs as well-tolerated as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could reduce the chances of catching Covid-19, this would be incredibly valuable."" The drugs can reduce fever and inflammation and are used as both a prevention and a treatment for malaria. Hydroxychloroquine regulates the body's immune response and is also used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and Lupus - an inflammatory disease caused by an overactive immune system. Lupus charities in the UK and US have raised concerns that demand for the drug associated with coronavirus could threaten the supply for patients who already rely on it. The drug gained attention after US President Donald Trump suggested it may be beneficial, and this week said he was taking hydroxychloroquine to ward off coronavirus.The US Food and Drug Administration warned against use of the medication outside hospitals, where the agency has granted temporary authorisation for its use in some cases, or clinical trials.While the University of Oxford trial is taking place in a controlled clinical environment, the World Health Organization has warned that some individuals were self-medicating and risked causing themselves serious harm.It has not yet been shown to be safe and effective in the prevention or treatment of coronavirus and can cause dangerous heart arrhythmias. The trial also involves researchers from the UK, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Italy. "

In 2019, it reported losses of 12bn baht. But it has strongly denied rumours that it was looking to file for bankruptcy. In a statement on its website, Thai Airways said: ""it has no intention to file for bankruptcy, responding to rumours appeared in the news and online"".Colombian airline Avianca files for bankruptcyRyanair says passenger numbers set to halveVirgin Australia collapses into administrationThe airline is 51% owned by the Thai government and overseen by its State Enterprise Policy Committee (SEPC).

The airline will continue to operate.""The previous rescue package put forward by the airline involved a government guaranteed loan backed by the finance ministry.Thai Airways has around 80 planes and employs 22,000 people.

They will undergo further testing before they are used by NHS workers.Speaking from Thailand, Mr Thanakarnjanasuth added: ""We want to help our fans and help the NHS and so many people who need the masks right now.""Oxford United staff, including Mr Robinson, have delivered some of the masks to charities around Oxford, including Sobell House Hospice. Others will be posted out to season ticket holders over the age of 55. Mr Thanakarnjanasuth said people in Thailand are currently ""very concerned and cautious"" about the spread of coronavirus, particularly after the spread of SARS in Asia between 2002 and 2004. He added: ""We closed much earlier than the UK - only pharmacies, food stores, convenience stores and food delivery [are allowed to stay open].""One of Mr Thanakarnjanasuth's daughters was studying in London and self-isolated for a fortnight on her return to Thailand in March.

251,Coronavirus: Thai elephants face starvation as tourism collapses,"More than 1,000 elephants face starvation in Thailand because the coronavirus crisis has slashed revenue from tourism, conservationists say. An almost total absence of visitors means that many caretakers are struggling to afford food for Thailand's 4,000 captive elephants.The animals can eat up to 200kg (440lb) of food a day.Thailand reported 127 new confirmed cases of the virus on Monday, bringing the country's recorded total to 1,651.Lek Chailert, founder of the Save Elephant Foundation, told the BBC: ""If there is no support forthcoming to keep them safe, these elephants, some of whom are pregnant, will either starve to death or may be put on to the streets to beg.""Alternatively, some elephants may be sold to zoos or they may be returned to the illicit logging business, which officially banned the use of elephants in 1989. ""It's a very bleak outlook unless some financial help is received immediately,"" Lek Chailert adds.Do elephants risk their lives to save each other?It's a challenge to keep the animals fed and healthy at the best of times but now it's the dry season, which makes the situation even more extreme. Kerri McCrea, who manages the Kindred Spirit Elephant Sanctuary in Mae Chaem, in northern Thailand, said the villagers who live near her had brought approximately 70 elephants back to her area because they were not receiving any money from tourism anymore. ""Feeding elephants is a priority but the issue is that there's not enough forest left to feed them,"" she explains. Ms McCrae, who originally comes from Northern Ireland and is also a co-founder of the sanctuary, has to drive up to three hours a day to find enough grasses and corn stalks to feed the five elephants in her care.She says local elephant caretakers are forced to do the same.

Happy elephants, Kerri McCrae says, are usually swinging their tails or flapping their ears or even giving themselves dust baths to keep cool. But elephants get depressed when they're hungry, and none of that happy behaviour would be on display.""The worst case scenario is that owners will have to chose between themselves and their elephants,"" Ms McCrae says.

252,Thailand protest: Opposition takes to streets in rare protest,"Hundreds of pro-democracy protesters in Thailand have marched on the country's parliament in protest against the government of retired General Prayuth Chan-ocha, Mr Prayuth led a military coup six years ago and was elected as a civilian prime minister last year after a disputed vote.Some protesters, many of them students, wore black to commemorate what they describe as the death of democracy.The protesters' anger has been fuelled by the banning last month of the popular opposition party Future Forward."
253,Coronavirus: Tourism in Thailand hit by Covid-19,"Over the past 25 years, Thailand has experienced a spectacular economic crash (1997), a tsunami (2004), coups (2006, 2014), the occupation of its main international airport by protesters (2008) and serious political violence (2010).Yet the statistics speak for themselves. In 1960 around 80,000 foreign tourists came here.Last year it reached 39 million, earning more than $60bn (£46bn) for Thailand, and indirectly contributing around one fifth of the country's national income. The country's tourism sector was considered so robust that the country got the nickname ""Teflon Thailand"". Yet of those 39 million tourists last year, more than 10 million were Chinese.So when the Chinese government quarantined the city of Wuhan on 23 January, and stopped all overseas tours, the impact was felt immediately in Thailand. Shopping malls and temples in Bangkok were suddenly much quieter and less crowded.As more flights from China were cancelled, the airports emptied. You could whisk yourself through passport control in no time.For small-scale entrepreneurs, the collapse of Chinese tourism has been disastrous. Many of them, such as flower sellers, traditional dancers, and the drivers of the famous ""red cars"" minibuses in Chiang Mai, are reporting their income dropping by half over the past month. The informal association representing tour guides in Thailand thinks 25,000 people are now out of work.One of the first successes of Thailand's 60-year-long tourist boom was the island of Phuket, nicknamed the ""Pearl of the Andaman"" for its soft white-sand beaches and sparkling warm seas. The first foreign visitors in the 1980s and 1990s were mainly European and Australian, but the number of Chinese visitors last year shot up to about two million out of the 15 million foreigners.The mangrove-lined inlets on the east side of the island, a contrast to the beaches facing the west, are where the boats leave from to take tourists out to the islands offshore. Like many of Phuket's residents, Nattakit Lorwitworrawat moved here from his home town elsewhere in Thailand to start a business.His company now owns 30 speed boats, each able to carry 30 people. He has had to take 20 out of the water, and the remaining 10 are not getting much use. The inlet, normally constantly noisy from the sound of outboard motors, is now silent apart from the birds and the lapping water.EASY STEPS: How to keep safeA SIMPLE GUIDE:  What are the symptoms?MAPS AND CHARTS: Visual guide to the outbreakHOW A VIRUS SPREADS: An explanationWHAT IS A PANDEMIC? The WHO's definition ""At the peak two years ago we carried 1,000 clients a day. Today if we get 200 clients, that is considered very good - we would be very happy with that,"" says Nattakit.He has bank loans to service on many of his boats. If the crisis goes on beyond the end of this year, he says he will have to downsize the company and start laying off his staff.For those lower down the food chain it is even tougher. Somkiat Prasarn has a mortgage on his little house, and loans on the van and car he bought to take Chinese tourists out on day trips around the island. He is supporting four children and an elderly mother.His monthly payments on the loans, he said, are around $1,500 a month. Could he hold out for six months, I asked him? ""I cannot, sir,"" he says. Right now he is getting no custom at all apart from the occasional airport pickup.""The government needs to help us and soon,"" says Sarayuth Mallam, vice-president of the Phuket Tourism Association. ""We don't ask for much. But if they want us not to lay off staff, they have to help us by cutting or delaying tax payments, social security payments, and giving soft loans to businesses here.""Sarayuth also believes the powerful Tourism Authority of Thailand needs to start promoting Phuket aggressively in other markets outside China, like Russia, India and Australia. If they can control the virus in three months, he says, we can survive and come back.But nobody knows how long this crisis will last, nor how serious it will become. For the moment there are still plenty of Europeans, Australians and Russians on the famous beaches, but for how long?The authorities here have managed to control and monitor infections well considering how vulnerable it was from the number of Chinese people visiting before the restrictions on travel were implemented.Yet the country has already been placed on some government lists of places to avoid because of coronavirus risk. And people are booking holidays for later in the year, including the traditional high seasons of July-August and December-New Year in Thailand. Families with children from Europe or Australia are likely to think twice before travelling so far. And Thailand is now imposing its own restrictions, requiring 14-day quarantine for visitors from some countries, a list that may well expand.Who will risk booking a holiday in the sun if they end up spending it confined to their hotel room or a hospital? With more flights being cancelled every week, the numbers of non-Chinese tourists are bound to fall steeply this year, however quickly the virus is brought under control.The blow to this essential leg of Thailand's economy has come at a terrible time for the government. Already the other two main legs of the economy - manufacturing exports and agricultural commodities - are wobbling as higher wages and an overvalued local currency have been driving investors to cheaper neighbouring countries like Vietnam. Growth in what was once one of South East Asia's ""tiger economies"" has been anaemic for several years, and may stall completely this year. The government, an unwieldy coalition controversially built around the same military leaders who led the last coup, is proving clumsy and unpopular.It is an almost perfect storm, one that Thailand's present leaders look ill-equipped to weather.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Cashmere and climate change threaten nomadic life'After the coral ban, I lost everything' 'My job went abroad because of globalisation' Will someone develop a coronavirus vaccine?"

258,Thailand struggles to come to terms with first mass shooting,"When the news first broke of a man shooting randomly at bystanders in a provincial shopping mall, it was greeted with disbelief by many in Thailand. Thailand has more than its share of gun crime; gun ownership, and gunshot deaths, are among the highest in Asia. But no-one could remember a mass shooting like this before, every bit as bad as those in the United States. By the time it was over, 30 people, including the gunman, were dead.It began at a little after 3pm on a Saturday afternoon, at a house just outside the city of Nakhon Ratchasima, a sprawling commercial hub for Thailand's north-eastern region. A 32-year-old sergeant-major shot dead his commanding officer and the colonel's mother-in-law. The three had been in business together buying and selling land, and the sergeant-major was apparently angry about not being paid for a deal he had brokered.The gunman then went to the Surathampithak army base, a weapons and ammunition supply depot, where he worked. He shot at least one soldier, and was able to steal a truck, two assault rifles, a machine gun, and nearly 800 rounds of ammunition. He also had five guns of his own.'He aimed at the heads': Survivors recall shootingFrom there he went to a Buddhist temple, 15 minutes' drive away, where people were marking Makha Bucha, an important Buddhist holiday. He opened fire and killed nine people there, and moved into the city centre, and the upscale, airport-themed Terminal 21 shopping mall. At times videoing himself and streaming it to his Facebook page, he fired his assault rifle at passing cars, killing drivers and passengers. Inside the mall shoppers fled as he entered; hundreds remained trapped for many hours, sending out desperate messages on their phones. A special police squad went in late on Saturday night, but it was another 12 hours before they were able to kill him, with one police officer shot dead.At one level this is just another tragic instance of a man going on an inexplicable killing spree, which nobody could have foreseen. As a serving soldier he had access to lethal weapons, so the incident has not even prompted calls for tighter gun ownership regulations.Yet there is plenty of public anger being directed at the governmentThe Twitter hashtags ""Reform the Military"" and ""PrayuthRIP"" - the latter referring to Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who is commonly viewed as having responded clumsily and unsympathetically to the shooting. At an annual football game between Thailand's two top universities students carried a banner with an acronym everyone there knew represented the phrase ""With this stupid leader we will all die"".The military has played an outsized role in Thailand throughout its modern history. It has seized power a dozen times, most recently in 2014. The generals who led that coup are still in charge, even after an election last year; they re-wrote the constitution to ensure they held onto power. They style themselves the essential defenders of Thailand's untouchable monarchy, deterring or crushing opposition with accusations of disloyalty. Thailand 'anti-dictatorship run' draws thousandsVoting in Thailand's hybrid democracyThailand country profile The military is essentially unaccountable to civilian authority, with its own courts, and an expanding budget that remains largely beyond public scrutiny. Thai society has absorbed many military customs and values; civilian security guards routinely give soldierly salutes, civil servants take part in military-style parades, and the police sport paramilitary paraphernalia; it is not uncommon to see an immigration officer at the airport wearing the silver parachute wings of an elite commando. Every year in January, Thailand's celebrates a national Children's Day centred on army bases, where young children can play with guns and tanks. Thais have grown accustomed to the military being in their lives. In return, they have always assumed the soldiers will keep them safe, even as they complain of the perennial corruption and incompetence of the police.Last Saturday, the military could not do that, even from one of its own. The rogue soldier, it turned out, was a trained marksman, making him a difficult adversary in the cavernous interior of the mall.The revelation that the gunman had been provoked by a business deal gone sour served as a reminder to Thais that moonlighting by serving army officers, exploiting the authority their status gives them, is commonplace, and that some senior officers have become very wealthy, despite their modest official salaries. Such business practises are particularly problematic between different ranks, as junior officers are unable to challenge seniors they believe are cheating them, a commonly-heard complaint.The ease with which this soldier was able to steal substantial quantities of weapons and ammunition from an army base highlighted poor security procedures. It is not the first time lethal weaponry has gone astray in the military.The army commander General Apirat Kongsompong has promised to improve base security, but such promises have been heard before, and it was only last month that General Apirat promised the army would never allow ill-intentioned people to steal its weapons.The incident has compounded an impression in Thailand of incompetence by what is in effect still a military-led government. It has stumbled this year when responding to a serious air pollution problem, and more recently to the threat of the novel coronavirus. It has failed to revive an economy which has been stagnant since the 2014 coup, yet one in which the already yawning gap between rich and poor has widened.Many Thais still back the military's predominant role, nervous of renewed political conflict or radical change. But when Thailand held its first post-coup election a year ago, a new political party, calling itself Future Forward did surprisingly well, winning the third largest share of the votes by promising sweeping change, including a diminished role for the military, an end to coups and mandatory military service for young men, and full accountability for the purchases of big-ticket items like tanks and submarines. Younger Thais in particular responded positively to this platform.Future Forward had pledged to use its substantial block of seats in parliament to push its reforms, but the party has had multiple legal cases filed against it, some of which could see it dissolved and its leaders jailed. The military used its five years of authoritarian rule before the election to reshape many of the notionally independent institutions like the Constitutional Court and the Election Commission which will decide the party's future. Few Thais expect it to survive the legal attrition it now faces. Its dissolution would end the main challenge to the military's position of privilege in Thailand. But public sentiment is turning negative, perhaps more so than at any time in the past thirty years.After the shooting in Nakhon Ratchasima, the fiery army commander Apirat Kongsompong issued a tearful apology, and pleaded with the public not to blame the military for what happened. Once the gunman began shooting, he said, he was no longer a soldier. Whether Thais will accept this defence probably depends on how thorough an investigation the army is willing to allow, and how well it responds to the failures exposed by this rogue soldier. Past experience is not encouraging. Scandals, like the unexplained deaths of conscripts, have routinely been investigated internally. No soldiers have been held to account for the dozens killed by army gunfire in the political upheavals of 2010. Few will be betting that this time is different."

260,Thailand shooting: Survivors recall ordeal of gun rampage,"Terrified residents of the Thai city of Nakhon Ratchasima have been reliving their ordeal after a gunman roamed around a shopping centre on a shooting spree that killed 29 people.Some barricaded themselves in toilets or hid under tables, frantically searching for information on mobiles.Jakraphanth Thomma began his rampage on Saturday afternoon, but it only ended with his death 16 hours later.A vigil for victims has been held on Sunday, with monks chanting prayers.Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said the 32-year-old soldier, who had posted images during his attack on social media, appeared to have been motivated by a land dispute.Timeline: How the massacre unfoldedAnother 57 people were injured in the incident, an ""unprecedented number in Thailand"", the PM said.Jakraphanth began his attack at about 15:30 local time on Saturday (08:30 GMT) at a military camp, but it was his arrival at the Terminal 21 shopping complex that led to an indiscriminate shooting spree.Many of the victims were killed as he arrived, some in their cars, others outside the complex. Graphic images appeared on social media.Inside Terminal 21, a seven-floor complex designed on an airport theme, terrified shoppers were unsure whether to flee or hide.Nattaya Nganiem was leaving the complex by car when she heard gunfire and saw one woman ""run out from the mall hysterically"". She saw a motorcyclist dump his motorcycle and run.One who saw the gunman, Diaw, told Amarin TV the attacker ""was shooting everywhere and his shots were very precise"". He aimed at the heads of victims, Diaw said, adding that one of his colleagues was killed.Up on the fourth floor, Chanathip Somsakul, 33, barricaded himself into the women's toilets with dozens of others, using cubicle doors to wedge the entrance shut. They all scoured mobile devices to get information. But he said there was so much information, no-one knew what to believe.""Everyone was terrified. A friend who works at the mall was talking to a guy in the CCTV control room... he gave us updates on the location of the gunman,"" he told AFP news agency.When police arrived at about 21:00, they left in an orderly fashion, but started running when shots rang out.Charlie Crowson, a teacher of English who lives in Nakhon Ratchasima, told the BBC there were ""bodies on the streets"" of the normally peaceful city.He said one of his girlfriend's former students was among those killed in the attack. Jakraphanth was eventually shot dead by the security forces.At the city morgue on Sunday, Natthawut Karnchanamethee was mourning the loss of his 13-year-old son, Ratchanon Karnchanamethee.""He's my only son. I allowed him to do anything he wanted to. I never set expectations for him. I only wanted him to be a good person,"" Mr Natthawut said.At the vigil on Sunday, 13-year-old Lapasrada Khumpeepong said she and her mother had been cornered in a bathroom at the complex for five hours.She wrote on a condolence board: ""Thank you to those who sacrificed themselves to keep others alive. Without you, we would not be here today.""Mr Prayuth travelled to Nakhon Ratchasima, also known as Korat, to meet wounded survivors.The PM said he believed the gunman was involved in a ""personal conflict... over a house deal"" that involved a relative of his commanding officer, both of whom Jakraphanth shot dead at the military base at the start of his rampage.Mr Prayuth said: ""I hope this is the only one and the last incident, and that it never happens again. No-one wants this to happen. It could be because of this person's mental health in this particular moment.""Forensic experts continue to work at the shopping complex.Jakraphanth served at Suatham Phithak military camp, about 250km (155 miles) from the capital, Bangkok.Army sources said he was a sharpshooter and had taken courses on attacks, including the planning of ambushes.He used social media heavily, including posting pictures of himself with weapons.Jakraphanth killed another soldier as he stole a military vehicle and weapons - two rifles, one M60 machine gun and 770 rounds of ammunition - from the base.A Facebook post before the attack read: ""Rich from cheating. Taking advantage of other people. Do they think they can spend the money in hell?""During the attack - and before his Facebook account was taken down - he wrote: ""Death is inevitable for everyone."""
261,Thailand shooting: How the massacre unfolded,"On Saturday 8 February, Thai soldier Jakraphanth Thomma killed his commanding officer, stole weapons from a military base, and went on to launch a devastating attack on civilians in the city of Nakhon Ratchasima.So far 26 people have been confirmed dead with 57 injured, but those numbers could rise. On Sunday morning, the security forces shot Jakraphanth dead, after he had been holed up all night in a shopping centre. Thai soldier kills 20 in shooting rampageHere's how it all unfolded (all times local, GMT +7 hours)The attack begins. Jakraphanth, 32, kills his commanding officer, Col Anantharot Krasae, 48, and Col Anantharot's 63-year-old mother-in-law, Anong Mitchan.Jakraphanth steals weapons - an HK33 assault rifle, BBC Thai reports - and ammunition, before fleeing the camp in a Humvee-type vehicle.Footage appears to show Jakraphanth arriving at the Terminal 21 shopping centre in Korat.He goes on to indiscriminately shoot at people inside the mall, killing and injuring dozens of people.He posts updates on Facebook during the attack.Officials confirm that Jakraphanth is on the fourth floor of the shopping centre. Reports say he is holding hostages inside.He posts a video of himself holding a rifle on Facebook, and says: ""Tired, I can barely move my fingers.""People trapped inside the shopping centre hide in bathroom cubicles and under tables, they later tell BBC Thai.Facebook takes down the post and profile soon afterwards.Facebook says in a statement: ""Our hearts go out to the victims, their families and the community affected by this tragedy in Thailand. ""There is no place on Facebook for people who commit this kind of atrocity, nor do we allow people to praise or support this attack.""Colonel Krishna Phatthanacharoen, deputy spokesman for the Royal Thai Police, confirms that more than 10 people have died. A number of police officers surround the shopping centre, while others enter the building to try and help people inside to escape.A radius of 2km around the shopping centre is cordoned off.Police officers meet Jakraphanth's mother, and bring her to the shopping centre so she can attempt to persuade him to surrender.The official death toll rises to 16.Another round of gunfire is heard from within the shopping centre, before calming down again.A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence says that the military will assist the police in protecting the shopping centre, and helping people trapped inside to escape.Officers confirm that they have managed to clear the ground floor of the shopping centre, as well as floors one, two and three. Images show people fleeing.Army officials ask news outlets to stop live coverage of the attack, to avoid giving the suspect information about their operations.Deputy Prime Minister Anutin Charnverakul confirms that the death toll has risen to 20. He says 16 people died at the scene, while another four died in hospital.He adds that two police officers have been shot in the back and the leg, and are currently undergoing surgery.There are reports of sporadic rounds of gunfire within the building. Special Operations officers enter the building.At the same time, about five ambulances arrive at the shopping centre to take injured people to hospital. A member of the security forces dies in the operation.The security forces announce that they have shot dead the gunman. Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul posts on his Facebook page, thanking the police and the military officers who carried out the operation.""It is unprecedented in Thailand, and I want this to be the last time this crisis happens,"" said Prayuth Chan-ocha outside a hospital in Nakhon Ratchasima. He announced a revised death toll of 26, plus the gunman, with 57 people wounded. He said that a property deal  appeared to have given Jakraphanth a sense of grievance which led to his rampage."
262,Thailand shooting: Soldier who killed 26 in Korat shot dead,"A soldier who killed 26 people in a gun rampage in the Thai city of Nakhon Ratchasima has been shot dead by the security forces, Thai police say.Jakraphanth Thomma on Saturday killed his commanding officer before stealing weapons from a military camp.The suspect continued his attack on the streets and in a shopping centre in Nakhon Ratchasima, also known as Korat.The gunman, who posted material to social media, was shot dead after being cornered all night in the building. Thailand's Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha gave the higher death toll on Sunday, an increase from an earlier figure of 20.  Fifty-seven people are wounded. ""It is unprecedented in Thailand, and I want this to be the last time this crisis happens,"" he said, after visiting the wounded at a hospital in Nakhon Ratchasima.He said the motive for the attack appeared to be Jakraphanth's grudge over his belief that he had been cheated in a property deal. Timeline: How the massacre unfoldedPublic Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul posted on his Facebook page on Sunday morning, congratulating the security forces for their actions in the north-eastern Thai town.""Thank you police and army for ending the situation. Shooter shot dead!!!""Shortly after 03:00 local time (20:00 GMT on Saturday) gunfire was heard as the security forces raided the building, trying to dislodge the gunman.Several people were led out of the centre, but there were concerns that more people were being held hostage.At 09:30 (02:30 GMT) on Sunday, police confirmed that the gunman had been shot dead, but so far there are no more details about how the operation concluded. Earlier reports said the gunman, aged 32,  had tried to escape via the back of the building.The suspect's mother was also brought to the shopping centre to try to persuade him to give himself up.One of the people freed told the BBC how she and others hid in a bathroom on the fourth floor, before fleeing to the second and hiding under a restaurant table for three hours, hearing at least four gunshots before she saw some soldiers and could get to safety.Charlie Crowson, a teacher of English who lives in Nakhon Ratchasima, told the BBC there were ""bodies on the streets"" of the normally peaceful town.He said that one of his girlfriend's former students was among those killed in the attack that lasted for many hours.It began at about 15:30 local time on Saturday (08:30 GMT) at the Suatham Phithak military camp, where the commanding officer, named by the Bangkok Post as Col Anantharot Krasae, was killed.The Post said a 63-year-old woman, Col Anantharot's mother-in-law, and another soldier were also killed there.The suspect seized arms and ammunition from the camp before taking a Humvee-type vehicle.He then opened fire at a number of sites before arriving at Terminal 21 at about 18:00 local time (11:00 GMT).Local media footage appeared to show the suspect getting out of his vehicle and firing shots as people fled.CCTV footage showed him inside the shopping centre with a raised rifle.He posted on his social media accounts during the attack, with one post on Facebook asking whether he should surrender.He had earlier posted an image of a pistol with three sets of bullets, along with the words ""it is time to get excited"" and ""nobody can avoid death"".Facebook has now taken the page down.It said: ""Our hearts go out to the victims, their families and the community affected by this tragedy in Thailand.

263,Thailand shooting: Soldier kills 21 in gun rampage,"A soldier has killed 21 people and injured dozens more in a gun rampage in the Thai city of Nakhon Ratchasima.Jakraphanth Thomma on Saturday killed his commanding officer before stealing weapons from a military camp.The suspect continued his attack in a shopping centre, where he is still believed to be holed up, initially posting updates on his social media.Security forces are in the complex and have rescued hundreds while searching for the gunman, with shots ringing out.How the massacre in Nakhon Ratchasima unfoldedThe gunman's motives remain unclear. The Terminal 21 shopping centre in Nakhon Ratchasima, also known as Korat, remains sealed off on Sunday.Shortly after 03:00 local time (20:00 GMT Saturday) gunfire was heard as the security forces raided the building, trying to dislodge the gunman.One member of the security forces was killed and two injured.Several people were led out of the centre, but it is not known how many more people are still trapped inside.Earlier reports said the gunman had tried to escape via the back of the building.The Bangkok Post reported earlier that the suspect, who it said was 32 years old, had taken hostages, but this also has not been officially confirmed.The suspect's mother was also brought to the shopping centre to try to persuade him to give himself up.One of the people freed told the BBC how she and others hid in a bathroom on the fourth floor, before fleeing to the second and hiding under a restaurant table for three hours, hearing at least four gunshots before she saw some soldiers and could get to safety.Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul earlier said that 16 people had died at the scene of the shootings, with another four dying later in hospital. A total of 31 people have been injured, with 10 of them in a critical condition. But there are fears the numbers could rise.It began at about 15:30 local time on Saturday (08:30 GMT) at the Suatham Phithak military camp, where the commanding officer, named by the Bangkok Post as Col Anantharot Krasae, was killed.The Post said a 63-year-old woman, Col Anantharot's mother-in-law, and another soldier were also killed there.The suspect seized arms and ammunition from the camp before taking a Humvee-type vehicle.He then opened fire at a number of sites before arriving at Terminal 21 at about 18:00 local time (11:00 GMT).Local media footage appeared to show the suspect getting out of his vehicle and firing shots as people fled.CCTV footage showed him inside the shopping centre with a raised rifle.Other footage showed a fire outside the building, with some reports saying it was caused by a gas canister that exploded when it was hit with a bullet.

265,Mother and daughters told 'too big' for business class,"Enjoying the luxury of business class seats on an 11-hour flight back to Auckland was meant to be a treat for Renell and Tere after undergoing weight-loss surgery in the city of Bangkok.Instead, the sisters and their mother, Huhana, were left ''traumatised'' by Thai Airways staff who came at them with tape measures telling them they were ''too big'' for their business class seats.Six months on from that ''disgusting'' experience and Huhana, 59, is still bitter about the experience. ''The staff were shouting 'too big, too big' at us repeatedly. Rows of people watched as they measured us at the check-in. It was so humiliating the way we were treated that I just broke down in tears,'' said Huhana.The language barrier didn't help as staff refused to let them enter the business class section and made them sit in economy class. Huhana, a social worker, says she won't fly again until she loses weight, to avoid the sort of traumatic experience Thai Airways put her and her daughters through.""We were really looking forward to flying on business class and instead we were left traumatised,'' she added.Most airlines can provide seatbelt extensions for larger passengers. But Thai Airways said its business class seatbelts are fitted with built-in air bags which means they can't be extended. The family are still confused by this explanation. Family kicked off flight 'for body odour' Does fat shaming help people lose weight?Since their traumatic experience last summer, Huhana and her daughters have been trying to get a refund from Thai Airways. But the airline has only offered to recompense the family based on the difference between business and economy fares.She approached the travel agent she booked the flights with, Flight Centre, who said it would provide a full refund, although the family had to wait more than six months for it.When contacted by the BBC, a spokesman for Thai Airways said it now has better warnings in place on its reservations system so agents are made aware of such issues. The family were on a tour organised by Destination Beauty, which specialises in sending clients to Thailand for weight-loss and plastic surgery.Martin Olsen, chief executive of Destination Beauty, said he was ''very saddened and surprised'' at the way the airline handled the situation. He was also confused by the actions of Thai Airways staff as ''many obese people book business class as they are unable to fit comfortably into economy class''.When it comes to oversized passengers, it's up to the discretion of each airline how to manage the situation, a spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said.Airlines do calculate the take-off weight for a plane, but this takes into account the estimated weight of passengers, their luggage and fuel. ''In most cases the average passenger is well under the weight limit as the allowance tends to be fairly generous,'' he said.Most airlines recommend that if you think you will be too big for your seat, you should buy a second seat at the time you make your booking. But few airlines have specific guidelines when it comes the definition of ''oversized''. However, American Airlines does state '''if a customer's body extends more than one inch beyond the outermost edge of the armrest and a seatbelt extension is needed, another seat is required''. "
266,'Thai bride' Yorkshire Dales body: Police frustration over delays,"Police investigating the death of a Thai woman whose body was found in the Yorkshire Dales 15 years ago say they are frustrated at hold-ups in the case.Lamduan Armitage, nee Seekanya, was found near Pen-y-ghent in 2004 having moved to the UK in 1991 after marrying her husband David Armitage in Thailand.North Yorkshire Police is still waiting to obtain the legal authority to carry out inquiries in Thailand.Adam Harland, from the force, said he was frustrated with the long delays.Police said they were awaiting permission from the UK Central Authority.Mr Harland, manager of major investigation team's cold case review unit, said detectives are determined to seek answers for the family. ""We know that Lamduan's mother is not in good health, and it is very frustrating that we are still unable to... fully explain what happened to her daughter, or reunite her with her daughter's remains.""Unfortunately, there has been a long delay in being able to go to Thailand to interview members of Lamduan's family. ""We have had the support of the Thai Authorities to request their assistance to conduct enquiries in Thailand.""For this to happen, we need to gain legal authority from the ... UK Central Authority for which we have the support from local prosecutors.""Latest news from across YorkshireThe half-naked body of Ms Armitage, a mother of three, was found  by walkers on 20 September in a remote location on the Pennine Way.She was found more than a mile (2km) from the nearest road and was wearing only green jeans, socks and a gold wedding band.However, police were unable to identify her and she became known as The Lady of the Hills.A cold case review, launched in 2016, concluded she was aged between 25 and 35 and originally from south-east Asia.Investigators also found evidence she had been living in north Lancashire or south Cumbria, with detectives suggesting she could have been a ""Thai bride"" who had been murdered.In January, after reading a BBC story on the cold case, her family from Udon Thani in north-east Thailand came forward to say they believed the woman was their daughter who they had not seen since 2004.This led to North Yorkshire Police carrying out DNA testing with family members in Thailand in order to confirm Ms Armitage's identity.Mr Armitage has previously said he was not involved in his wife's death, according to The Sun.

267,Fireflies face extinction risk - and tourists are partly to blame,"Firefly tourism is on the rise globally but scientists are warning it may contribute to risk of the insect's extinction.""I spotted a hundred flickering lights, illuminating a palm like a Christmas tree.""""Our guide waved his flashlight at the fireflies. They slowly engulfed us - we were surrounded by a shiny galaxy of glowing beetle stomachs.""""I reached out a hand and captured one in my fist.""Reading this travel blogger's enchanting experience in 2019 makes it clear why firefly tours are popular, but done badly, it risks killing the insects.Habitat loss and light pollution from urbanisation and industrialisation are the leading threats to firefly populations, according to research published this week.But firefly tourism, which attracts thousands of visitors in countries including Mexico, the US, the Philippines and Thailand, is a growing concern for conservationists.""Getting out into the night and enjoying fireflies in their natural habitat is an awe-inspiring experience,"" Prof Sara Lewis at Tufts University, who led the research, told the BBC.But tourists often inadvertently kill fireflies by stepping on them, or disturb their habitat by shining lights and causing soil erosion.Firefly festivals are organised in countries including Japan, Belgium, and India, and social media is magnifying this tourism, she adds.The tiny town of Nanacamilpa in Mexico became a celebrated firefly spot in the past decade.Some visitors post their sparkling photos on Instagram, flouting the ban on photography that many site managers impose, says local photographer Pedro Berruecos.The Mexican fireflies are especially vulnerable to tourists, Prof Lewis explains.Malaysia: 80,000 Great Smoky Mountains, Tennessee: 30,000 in two-three week summer seasonTaiwan: 90,000 Mexico: 200,000 in 2019, up from 180,000 in 2018Source: Professor Sara Lewis, Tufts UniversityThe female insects are wingless and cannot fly, meaning they live on the ground, where visitors walking around will trample on them.""No blame on the tourists, but if they walk on the forest floor, they will be standing on the female fireflies who will be carrying eggs. They are killing the next generation,"" Prof Lewis says.In Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines, the industry has existed for a few decades, but is usually poorly-managed, she explains.Congregating Mangrove fireflies live exclusively in mangrove trees along rivers.Males gather in huge numbers to attract females, producing the appealing glowing swarms that tourists desire.Motorised boats are driven up the rivers, creating water swells that erode the banks, killing the trees where the fireflies live.World's biggest iceberg makes a run for itCan Finland be carbon-neutral in 15 years?The 'unnoticed insect apocalypse': How people in towns and cities can help""Operators also crash boats into the banks to disturb trees and make fireflies fly out, creating a swarm for tourists to see,"" Prof Lewis explains. ""There is evidence that even just camera flashes disturb fireflies and interfere with their reproductive success, in addition to the flashlights used by tourists"".Prof Lewis is keen to emphasise that firefly tourism is often crucial to local economies and should not be banned.Instead tour operators and tourists can develop eco-friendly practices.Travel blogger Katie Diederichs and her husband, both from the US, chose an eco-friendly tour operator in Bohol, Philippines for their firefly experience in 2015. Travelling in a small group at night in kayaks with just one light, the experience was designed to be as unobtrusive as possible, Katie explains.""The amount of light from the fireflies made the mangroves look like Christmas trees - it was really magical. ""The male fireflies were flying around, giving the illusion of twinkling, while the females blink."" The company is run by locals who love the fireflies and want to protect their environment, she explains.But Katie says they witnessed other operators with ""large motorboat of tourists"" passing by them ""sending waves in our direction.""In Taiwan, the tourist board has invested in sustainable firefly tours and created ""thoughtful and effective"" firefly eco-tourism, Prof Lewis explains.Sites have regulated guided tours with raised walkways that allow small groups of people to walk through the habitat without trampling on fireflies. Instead of flashlights or headlamps that would disturb the insects, white paint illuminates the routes.A group of scientists will meet in 2020 to set down guidelines for how to run a sustainable firefly tourism company, Prof Lewis says.""It is very important to not disturb the fireflies' habitat while photographing,"" advises wildlife conservation photographer Carla Rhodes.She regularly photographs the Big Dipper firefly, as well as other wildlife, where she lives in the Catskill mountains in New York.Watch where you walk, she says, and be careful with your light sources.""And for goodness sake, please don't ever capture them!"""
268,Thai officials accidentally auction off car loaded with amphetamine,"Thailand's anti-drugs authority has apologised after it accidentally auctioned off a car hiding tens of thousands of amphetamine tablets. A buyer paid 586,000 baht ($19,000; £14,500) for the Honda CR-V car, which was put up for auction this month after being seized in a drugs case last year.But when it was sent to a garage for alterations, a mechanic discovered 94,000 pills stashed in its bumper.Officials said they would conduct more thorough searches in future.""According to protocols, we search every vehicle we have received and this case was no exception. However, we couldn't find anything at the time, perhaps because the pills had been well hidden,"" said Niyom Termsrisuk, secretary general of the Office of the Narcotics Control Board (ONCB), according to the Bangkok Post. Yaba: The cheap synthetic drug convulsing a nationBrothers jailed for UK-wide drugs ringThailand: What you need to knowMr Termsrisuk said the yaba pills - a mixture of methamphetamine and caffeine - were discovered in boxes hidden in a secret compartment behind the vehicle's bumper.When the car was seized in the northern province of Chiang Rai last year, 100,000 such pills were found on its back seat. Mr Termsrisuk said the additional pills would be added to the case, and that the mechanic and new owner would be rewarded for their cooperation. Yaba, which means ""crazy medicine"" in Thai, is typically smuggled into Thailand from Myanmar and sold as cheap red or pink pills. Authorities in Thailand seized 516 million meth tablets in 2018."
269,Future Forward: Thai opposition party cleared over Illuminati claims,"A court in Thailand has acquitted one of the country's largest opposition parties after it was accused of having links to a mythical secret society.A sedition charge against Future Forward alleged that it was influenced by the Illuminati and was seeking to overthrow the monarchy.The Constitutional Court dismissed the charge. A guilty verdict could have seen the party banned.But it is still facing several cases that could result in its dissolution.Future Forward was founded less than two years ago. It has appealed strongly to young voters and won the third largest share of seats in last year's general election.But the party's campaign to reform the military has angered supporters of the government, which is still headed by generals who led a military coup in 2014.The dismissed complaint accused Future Forward's founder and leader, Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, and other executives of being ""part of an anti-monarchist movement"".Thailand has a constitutional monarchy, but the royal family is highly revered by Thais and wields considerable power. The country's lese-majeste law forbids any criticism of the monarchy and carries a hefty prison sentence.The accidental invention of the IlluminatiWhy people believe conspiracy theoriesThailand 'run against dictatorship' draws thousandsThe party says it supports the monarchy and, on Tuesday, a judge ruled that it had not ""not acted... to overthrow"" it.The complaint also alleged that Future Forward was influenced by the Illuminati, which conspiracy theorists believe is an elite secret society that seeks world domination. It said the party's symbol resembles an upside-down triangle that is often associated with the mythical group.The complaint, which has been ridiculed by Future Forward, alleged that the Illuminati played a role in the fall of monarchies across Europe and was now seeking to do the same in Thailand.Pannika Wanich, a spokeswoman for Future Forward, said the case was an attempt to eliminate the party. ""This is a deliberate political harassment,"" she said.""We believe those cases are politically motivated,"" Mr Thanathorn told reporters following the ruling. Analysis by Jonathan Head, South-East Asia CorrespondentThere were cheers from supporters of Future Forward as the judges of the Constitutional Court read out their verdict. Some even called for Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to resign. The court has a track record of dissolving dissident political parties on seemingly trivial grounds, but the bizarre accusation this time - that Future Forward was allied to the Illuminati in a campaign against the monarchy - was judged too flimsy to warrant such punishment.But the party and its executives still face more than 20 other legal cases that could yet result in its dissolution. Its youthful and charismatic leader, Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, a wealthy businessman, is viewed as a dangerous subversive by many conservative Thais.Earlier this month, he joined a nationwide run to protest against Mr Prayuth's continued hold on power after last year's election. And he promised to lead more protests if his party is dissolved.Thailand has been buffeted by political instability for years, largely a battle between supporters of the military and former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.The country's military has a history of intervening in politics. Mr Prayuth, a retired general, led the military coup in 2014 and was elected as the country's civilian prime minister in June.Mr Thanathorn has emerged as one of the fiercest critics of the prime minister. Last year, he faced charges of sedition which were filed by an officer in the government."
270,Tesco faces Thai regulatory threat to $10bn deal,"The sale of Tesco's prized Asian assets - which are potentially valued at up to $10bn (£7.7bn) - may be at risk because of Thailand's competition regulations. The supermarket chain has nearly 2,000 outlets in Thailand and Malaysia that three Thai groups are hoping to buy.However, the successful bidder could face regulatory hurdles from Thailand's new anti-competition body. The country's fair trade commission said the winning bidder could own more than half of the sector in the country.Sakon Varanyuwatana, chairman of Thailand's Office of Trade Competition Commission, told me: ""The size of this bid and its scale means that potentially whoever ends up buying the Tesco assets could end up having more than 50% of the convenience, supermarket and hypermarket retail landscape.""Thailand's fair competition rules say that if a merger gives a company more than half of the total market share, it must seek permission from the country's fair trade commission.If it breaks the law, then it could be hit with a fine of not more than 0.5% of the merger's transaction value.All of the groups which have expressed interest in buying out Tesco are major retailers in Thailand, so face the risk of monopolising the market to varying degrees.CP Group, the Central Group and the TCC Group are all understood to be in the running, the BBC understands.Tesco has been considering the sale of its 2,000 retail outlets in Thailand and Malaysia since last year because of interest from potential bidders, whom it will not name.The CP Group and the Central Group would not comment when contacted by the BBC, while the TCC Group has not responded. The anti-competition rules could mean Tesco may not get the price it wants for the stores.The majority of Tesco's Asian stores are in Thailand and make up 28% of the country's grocery market, according to a report by Euromonitor in 2018. They are operated under the Tesco Lotus brand. The Thai business itself is thought to be worth between $6bn and $8bn, and could give the successful bidder access to deep supply chains among Thai farmers, allowing them to set prices for both suppliers and customers. Tesco shares have jumped on speculation about the bids for its Thai and Malaysian business, which I have been told could fetch up to $10bn.Tesco's sales fall in 'challenging' marketTesco considers sale of Thai and Malaysian operationsBids are due as early as Wednesday, but they would have to be submitted to the Thai anti-competition office at the same time, according to Mr Sakon. ""Any bidder would have to get approval from us first to ensure that they have done the due diligence and analysed what impact their purchase would have on the retail landscape in their sector and to ensure that it doesn't lead to a monopoly or is anti-competitive,"" he told me. He also confirmed that some of the companies mentioned in the media have made inquiries with his office about the bidding and approval process. ""They want a clarification about the procedure that they have to prepare,"" he said. ""The bidder can put in a bid to Tesco simultaneously if they meet the criteria prescribed in our notification.""There are political considerations too.  ""In the past, there have been concerns in Thailand over the political influence of well-connected Thai conglomerates who have been able to sway business decisions in their favour,"" says Pornapa Luengwattanakit of Baker & McKenzie in Bangkok. Ms Pornapa helped to draft the Thai anti competition law.""But under the new Trade Competition Act, the trade competition commission is an independent body and not under control of any political regime. They are now quite active and closely monitoring this high-profile transaction,"" she adds.The new Trade Competition Act also forbids members on the board of a company from being political, business or governmental figures.""We have a new office independent of the ministry of commerce or any political influence,"" said Mr Sakon. ""Regardless of how big a company you are, we want to make sure that the small and medium-sized enterprises in Thailand do not get hurt.""Analysts have told me that Tesco will have to consider who can pull off this deal if it wants to deliver value to its shareholders. But while the price it gets is important, it will need to first push this past the strict gaze of Thai regulators. In turn, the new Thai anti-competition regulator will be keenly watched. Any suggestion of influence from politically well-connected players in the Thai retail sector could threaten its independence, ultimately risking its credibility. "
271,Wuhan pneumonia outbreak: First case reported outside China,"A tourist in Thailand has become the first person outside China diagnosed with a new, pneumonia-like virus that has already infected dozens of people.The woman was quarantined after landing in Bangkok from Wuhan, eastern China, where the outbreak began in December.One person has died and 41 cases of the virus have been recorded so far.It has been identified as a coronavirus, which can cause illnesses ranging from common colds to potentially deadly Sars. Sars - severe acute respiratory syndrome - killed more than 700 people around the world during an outbreak in 2002-3, after originating in China.In total, it infected more than 8,000 people in 26 countries.China has been free of Sars since May 2004.China scientists 'find cause' of mystery illnessAccording to the country's official Xinhua news agency, the female passenger arrived in Thailand on 8 January, and was taken to hospital. No other passengers were infected, it said, adding that the traveller was now ready to return to Wuhan.Separately on Tuesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said for the first time that there appeared to have been limited person-to-person transmission of the virus, according to Reuters news agency.""From the information that we have it is possible that there is limited human-to-human transmission,"" Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of WHO's emerging diseases unit, told reporters in Geneva.She added that the organisation is preparing for the possibility of a wider outbreak: ""It is still early days, we don't have a clear clinical picture.""Many earlier cases of the virus had reportedly been linked to a fish market in Wuhan.The new case in Thailand comes just ahead of a major travel period in China, as hundreds of millions of people prepare to travel for Chinese New Year later this month. On 9 January, Singapore's airport said it would begin temperature screening travellers from Wuhan.Hong Kong health officials also said they would also implement checks on passengers, and that they had stepped up the disinfection of trains and aeroplanes, AFP news agency reported.BBC Health's Philippa Roxby reported earlier this month that this latest outbreak ""appears to have sparked memories for those who dealt with a Sars epidemic 18 years ago""."
272,Thailand 'run against dictatorship' draws thousands,"Thousands of people have taken part in park runs across Thailand to protest against the military-backed government and call for more political freedom.At least 10,000 people registered for the Run Against Dictatorship in the capital, Bangkok.Some 3,000 had put their names down for a similar event in another Bangkok park in support of Prayuth Chan-ocha.The former military ruler was returned to power as prime minister in elections last year.Thailand has been buffeted by political instability for years, largely a battle between supporters of the military and former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.The country's military has a history of intervening in politics and has seized power 12 times since the end of the absolute monarchy in 1932. Mr Prayuth, a retired general, led the military coup that removed Thaksin's sister Yingluck in 2014.In Bangkok, many anti-government protesters shouted ""Prayuth, get out!"" and ""Long live democracy"" as they jogged past a light security presence. Parallel events were held in other cities across the country.Many showed the three-finger salute used during the anti-government protests in 2014, a gesture featured in the Hunger Games series that symbolises unity amid struggle. Ex-military government chief elected PMThailand country profileThe main run in Bangkok was considered one of the biggest shows of dissent against Mr Prayuth's government.  It followed a large rally held last month by Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, a billionaire who has emerged as a fierce critic of the prime minister.""We want people to feel that to come out and demand our rights and express ourselves is something that can be done,"" Tanawat Wongchai, who organised Sunday's event, was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying.In another park of the capital, a smaller ""Walk to Cheer Uncle"" event took place to show support for the government and Mr Prayuth - Thais have nicknamed the prime minister Uncle Tu. ."

274,Thailand's disappeared Karen activist Billy and the burned village,"An oil barrel discovered at the bottom of a reservoir in a nature reserve in Thailand in April 2019 has cast a light on a story some would rather stayed hidden. It is a tale of powerful men and the lengths they will allegedly go to keep their crimes covered up. But it is also the story of one woman's determination to get justice for the man she loved and the community he was fighting for.Pinnapa ""Muenoor"" Prueksapan remembers the words that her husband told her back in 2014 as if it happened yesterday. ""He told me: 'The people involved in this aren't happy with me. They say that if they find me they'll kill me. If I do disappear, don't come looking for me. Don't wonder where I've gone. They'll probably have killed me'.""So I said to him: 'If you know you're in danger like this, why can't you stop helping your grandfather and the village?'. ""And he said to me: 'When you're doing the right thing, you have to keep fighting, even if it means you may lose your life.'.""And after he said that, I couldn't ask him to stop,"" she recalls. When Porlajee ""Billy"" Rakchongcharoen left for work on 15 April that same year, Muenoor didn't ask any questions. He left just like any other day, grabbing the overnight bag his wife packed for him and walking out the door without saying goodbye. He told Muenoor that he was going to meet with people in his role as a locally elected official - but that wasn't the whole truth. In fact, Billy had gone to meet his grandfather and members of his village to collect evidence to take to lawyers in Bangkok - evidence he hoped would prove once and for all local authorities in this remote part of southern Thailand were illegally evicting indigenous communities. Three days later, Muenoor got a phone call from Billy's brother asking if he had arrived home safely. But he still wasn't home. Suddenly she remembered Billy's words.And now, Billy had disappeared. Perhaps that phone call would never had happened had it not been for another tragedy three years earlier.In July 2011, three military helicopters crashed in a remote part of Kaeng Krachan National Park, near Thailand's southern border with Myanmar. They went down one after the other in a series of accidents blamed on bad weather. The tragedy was further compounded by the fact the last two helicopters had been sent to collect the remains of the first. Seventeen people lost their lives in the three accidents: 16 soldiers and one member of Bangkok's press. The crashes drew the attention of the country's media. Soon journalists from all over Thailand were descending on the area, which meant, for the first time, all eyes were focused on this quiet, rural region - and the dark secrets it hid.In the end, a tip-off led the journalists to a remote location, far into the dense green jungle of the country's biggest national park, and to the very secret the soldiers had seemingly died trying to protect.Because there, deep in the forest, were the charred remains of a village.The village had once been home to a small indigenous community, made up of about 100 families from the Karen minority. They were farmers, living a simple life, in balance with their surroundings.It was where Billy had grown up with his grandfather, Karen spiritual leader Ko-ee Mimee.Their existence, in some ways, sounded idyllic. But the 352,000 Karen people who live in Thailand are seen as outsiders. The majority of the world's five million Karen people live in neighbouring Myanmar.But decades of persecution and a long-running civil war with the government in Myanmar have forced thousands of Karen civilians to cross the border, where the Thai authorities have labelled them a foreign threat, said to be associated with drug smuggling and militant insurgencies.And that is apparently why locals say national park rangers turned up, evacuated the village and burnt everything to the ground weeks before the doomed helicopter flights.The military helicopter is understood to have been on its way to the village to ensure it had been completely and utterly destroyed.Billy wasn't there the night the park rangers arrived in 2011. He had married Muenoor and moved away to a village nearer her family.But his grandfather, a spiritual leader and a well-respected member of the village, was at home, and allowed the rangers to stay the night in his hut.""On that day, there were three helicopters flying above the village,"" a Karen man, who wishes to remain anonymous, told the BBC. ""That first day there were 15 park rangers. They went into Billy's grandfather's house. They spoke to him and asked to stay for the night.""  Ko-ee Mimee had no idea what was about to happen. ""The park rangers didn't say or do anything that felt threatening, except for the fact they came with guns. The following day, at 9am, the helicopters returned. The village chief told Billy's grandfather to pack his clothes and walk with the park rangers to the helicopters,"" the Karen man recalls.  Even when the villagers were told to get into the helicopters, there was no panicking: they still didn't understand what was happening.It was only as they rose up above the trees that the enormity of what was taking place finally became clear.""As we took off I started to see smoke and I could hear the crackling of the wood from the fire,"" the villager tells the BBC. ""When the helicopter was high above the village I looked down and saw my whole house in flames.""Everything inside Billy's grandfather's house was burned. All he had was one bag with his hat and a shirt inside. The rest of the villagers weren't able to bring any of their possessions. ""Everything we had ever owned was burned down along with our homes.""Chaiwat Limlikidacsorn, then the national park chief, would later tell journalists the families were invaders, and that the village was used as a transit point for Karen drug smugglers coming over the border from Myanmar. Under Thai law, he would argue, permanent structures could not be built inside protected national parks, and that year Chaiwat's team of rangers were applying for Kaeng Krachan to become a Unesco World Heritage site.Billy's community denied the allegations. They said military maps dating from 1912 even showed their village had existed in the same location for at least a hundred years, and long before the forest became a national park in 1981.""The way we lived and farmed was in harmony with the forest,"" Abisit ""Jawree"" Charoensuk, a local Karen from the village, tells the BBC. ""We Karens respect nature as our God. We worship a water God, a forest God and every living thing in the forest. Our farming technique is environmentally friendly. And we grow things we can consume all year round.""We catch fish in the river, we catch small animals in the forest and we grow rotation crops. We grow rice to sell and the women weave clothes to sell.""Achieving the impossible: Thai cave rescue a year onThe sacred water that makes a kingThe princess and Thailand's political gamesBut after the village was burned, when park authorities moved the community to the outskirts of Kaeng Krachan, things were very different.""There is no rice for us to harvest because there is no land for us to grow rice on. The land they moved us onto is all rock,"" Billy told journalists in 2011. ""Since we cannot make a living, we don't know how to survive. Some of us don't have Thai citizenship so we can't look for jobs in the city. ""Many are afraid if they leave the area they'll be arrested by the police. We can't make a living down here; we need to go back to where we were."" The destruction of his village was a turning point for Billy, transforming the young farmer into a human rights activist. He and his grandfather got in contact with lawyers in the capital, Bangkok, some two and a half hours drive away.But it was the helicopter crash which finally gave their plight the attention it needed.Billy became more and more passionate about getting justice. He organised seminars about Karen community rights, and travelled the country explaining what had happened to his village. He spearheaded attempts to sue the park rangers for compensation.""Billy acted as an assistant to the lawyer representing the villagers,"" Muenoor explains.  ""He collected evidence for them, spoke to the villagers and found out what happened and what exactly they lost. He took his grandfather to the administrative court so he could sue the national park rangers who burned down their village."" The last time Billy was seen alive, he was being arrested for taking wild honey out of the forest.The arrest itself was not unusual: it is illegal to take anything from the forest, but most people pay a fine and are let go.But Billy had more than just wild honey on him that day. He also had the evidence from the Karen villagers and his grandfather - the same documents he hoped to use in court to sue the park rangers. When Muenoor tried to report her husband's disappearance to local police, she says they dismissed her concerns. But she knew in her heart what had happened.""I thought he was dead because if he was still alive or in hiding he would have found a way to contact me or his family because that's what he was like - he was a smart guy. He would have found a way to contact me that first day he went missing.""Billy had been, as the saying goes in Thailand, ""carried away"". Human rights groups say thousands of activists have disappeared like this over the decades, although the United Nations puts the number at just 82. Many families are too afraid to go to the police to report their loved ones are missing.Muenoor, however, was not scared. In the months and years that followed, with the help of lawyers in Bangkok, she launched repeated requests for a judicial investigation into Billy's unlawful detention. But time and time again they were rejected on the grounds of a lack of evidence - even though police couldn't find any record of Billy's release from custody. And although traces of human blood were found in a vehicle belonging to the park office, it wasn't possible to verify if the blood belonged to Billy because the vehicle was cleaned before forensic experts could examine it.But then again, without a body, there was not much anyone could do: no one has ever been brought to justice for making someone disappear, for carrying them away. In fact, the crime of enforced disappearance doesn't exist in Thailand. Muenoor's fight for justice suffered a further blow when Thailand's Department of Special Investigation (DSI), which looks into high profile cases like those involving government officials, said they wouldn't be taking up Billy's case.Meanwhile, Chaiwat, the national park chief, was promoted and moved out of the area.   But then, in an unexpected development, the DSI, under pressure from international human rights groups, suddenly announced they would start investigating Billy's disappearance in June 2018. Less than a year later, Muenoor received a strange phone call: investigating officers asked her to go to the reservoir in Kaeng Krachan National Park. They told her to bring incense, the smoke of which Karen people believe connects this world to the next. When she arrived, they asked Muenoor to pray next to the water.""Billy, if you are here under the bridge, please reveal yourself or show me a sign so that I and everyone here trying to help can bring you justice and find evidence,"" she prayed. ""Then we can take your case to the next step to reveal the truth about what really happened.""With the help of an underwater robot, a team of divers set about searching the reservoir. What they found was a rusty, 200-litre oil drum. Inside were burnt fragments of bone. That in itself was unsurprising: oil drums have been used since World War Two to torture and burn alive those who defy the government. They have become symbolic of a culture of impunity. A DNA test indicated it was Billy inside the drum. Afterwards, officials sent Muenoor a picture of a skull fragment - burnt, cracked and shrunken after being exposed to heat as high as 300 degrees Celsius. Whoever did this, it seemed, had tried to conceal the crime. ""What kind of person could do something like this to another person?"" Muenoor asks. ""It's not human. I was devastated that he had to go through something like that. Whoever did this never thought about Billy's family or how this would affect us. If this had happened to the killer's family, how would he have felt?""In November 2019, the DSI issued an arrest warrant. It was for Kaeng Krachan National Park's former chief, Chaiwat Limlikidacsorn, and three other park rangers. They deny any wrongdoing.The arrest came as a shock for many in Thailand. It is unusual for someone in a senior role working for the state to be arrested on such serious charges.And Chaiwat has made his feelings clear.""Ever since it happened, the DSI and the media have depicted me in a negative way,"" Chaiwat has complained to reporters. ""It's ruined my simple life as a government official, along with my three junior colleagues. They've also destroyed my family.""Instead of being an honest government official and protecting the forest I am forced to stand in front of all of you here today. I've devoted my entire life, strength and energy to help this nation.""Chaiwat and the three park rangers are charged with six offences, including premeditated murder, unlawful detention and the concealment of Billy's body.Enforced disappearance is not one of them.   Even so, if Chaiwat and the other park rangers are found guilty of Billy's murder, it will be the first time one of the so-called disappeared gets justice. People like prominent human rights lawyer Surapong Kongchantuk believe enough pressure will be generated to force the Thai government to pass an enforced disappearance law. ""Patterns have emerged in these disappearance cases,"" Mr Surapong tells the BBC. ""In most cases, people disappear in broad daylight. And a lot of people are around as witnesses. But the bodies are never found, so they can't prosecute.""If we can find justice for Billy, this will be a game changer for Thailand.""But while Billy's death may change Thai law, the reason he is said to have lost his life - the fight for his village - has not been won. Even though the Karen villagers won the case against the Department of National Parks and got compensation of 50,000 baht ($1,600; £1,200) for each family, they haven't been allowed back.And years of struggle have taken their toll on Muenoor as well. She admits it's been hard for the whole family to lose Billy, especially the children.""His case was on the news so much that one day they asked me how come the person who did this to our dad isn't in jail? What did dad do to him? Why did he have to kill dad?"" Muenoor says.""It's been difficult. I've had to stay strong. I have to take care of everything at home. I have to work to earn a living, and on top of that I'm still trying to get justice for Billy. When he was still here, he supported me.""My life has turned upside down, from day into night.""A BBC radio documentary will explore more about Billy's disappearance on Thursday, 2 January."

The opening ceremony was attended by monks, government officials and park rangers."
277,The Indian Ocean tsunami remembered by those who survived it,"Shortly before 08:00 on 26 December 2004, a magnitude-9.1 earthquake struck under the sea in northern Indonesia.In the hours that followed, a massive tsunami fanned out across the Indian Ocean, killing close to 230,000 people, most in Indonesia.Ahead of the 15th anniversary of the tragedy, BBC Thai's Chaiyot Yongcharoenchai visited southern Thailand, which was devastated by the tsunami.This is the story of some of those who survived and what they did to help afterwards. You may find some of the details distressing.Wittaya Tantawanich - emergency worker, Patong beachThat morning on Patong beach was very quiet. I was stationed close to Patong Hospital on a rescue truck. Then I got hungry, so I drove toward the beach in order to find something to eat.Dr Weerawit Sarideepan - then-doctor at Vachira Phuket HospitalIt was the day after the hospital staff party - it was my day off and I had a long lie-in. At 08:00, I heard my wooden bedroom windows were shaking. I told my wife that it must be from the car outside. Then I rolled back to sleep.Samran Chanyang - master of ceremonies and mortician at Yan Yao templeI led the prayer ceremony on the morning of 26 December 2004, which was a Buddhist holy day. I said the prayer into the microphone, so everyone could hear it. All of a sudden, we lost the power and we felt the earthquake. I continued without the speaker afterwards.Wittaya TantawanichI sat there to enjoy my breakfast with the beach view. As I sat there, I felt the earthquake at around 08:00. No one panicked or worried. I continued to sit there waiting to get an emergency call.Sathaporn Sawangpuk - captain of the Mahidol shipWe were on our way back from a month-long marine research trip in the Indian Ocean. We made a stop at Koh Racha Yai island in Phuket for a diving lesson for our interns. The sea was quite calm, the sky was so clear and blue. I told my team: 'What a perfect day to be in the sea.'Primpraow Jitpentom - nurse on a diving trip near the Mahidol shipI took my friends from Bangkok out for a diving trip on that Sunday morning. I did this many times but my husband had never seen the underwater world. I told him it was really worth it.Captain Sathaporn SawangpukAfter breakfast, we all went to the end of the boat on the deck to watch the intern diving with instructors. All of a sudden, I felt the ship lift and swing to the left and to the right. We had no idea what happened, but my instinct told me to start the ship and head out to the middle of the sea.Primpraow JitpentomOur speedboat was getting closer to the shore. All of a sudden, the diving instructor told the boat driver to stop since he noticed something was wrong. He pointed to the sea and told me there was no water at the beach. He told me: 'This can't be good.'Wittaya Tantawanich - on Patong beachAt 10:00, I started to hear local food sellers, they were pointing to the beach. They all said 'Let's go catch fish.' The water had gone down very far, to the middle of the sea, and there were many fish lying around all over the place. I chuckled at what I saw but it wasn't long before I realised something was wrong. As the water came back, one food seller ran back and told everyone in that area to run away from the beachfront as far as possible.Captain Sathaporn SawangpukAs I looked toward the shore of the island, I saw one big wave hit the beach and sweep umbrellas and chairs down into the sea.Wittaya TantawanichIt didn't look like the killer wave you see in the movies. What I saw at first was just a flash flood that brought a massive amount of water. As the flood got closer, it started to pick up speed. Finally it hit street level and the water continued to rise. I hopped back in my truck and drove up the hill. At that moment, everything was crazy. So many people were running away from the water.Somchai Jitpentom - doctor on diving holiday with his wifeI contacted my friend who was in the navy and he told me it was a tsunami. He told us to find a big ship and get up there. I saw the Mahidol ship was on its way out from the bay, so we stopped them and asked for help. Captain Sathaporn SawangpukThen the water went down, so far out, before the second wave hit the beach again. This time it dragged bungalows and restaurants down to the sea with it.Somchai JitpentomAs we got on the ship, I saw houses and restaurants on Koh Racha Yai pulled down into the sea. That's when I realised something serious had happened. So we all agreed that we should go help other people on the nearby island since we had two doctors and two nurses on board.Primpraow Jitpentom - nurse, and Somchai's wifeI held my sons tight in my arms and told them 'Mummy and Daddy love you very much. If anything happens, just stay afloat in this life vest. Don't try to swim, someone will come to find you and help you.'Wittaya Tantawanich - on Patong beachI heard on my walkie-talkie that the second wave had hit. It didn't take long before the whole city was in mayhem. I went back down after the second wave retreated. At that point, I still had no idea what had happened. All I knew was I had to help people.Samran Chanyang - master of ceremonies and mortician at Yan Yao templeThe ceremony ended just like any other day. Then I went back home, right behind the temple.Suddenly I heard a lot of cars go by on the main street. All of them were speeding through and honking and they passed by the area. Then villagers here started talking about how villages along the beach here were all gone because of the wave.Dr Weerawit Sarideepan - then-doctor at Vachira Phuket HospitalWhen I woke up again around 10:00, I took my family out for breakfast before I received a phone call from the hospital calling me in for an emergency. We had a plan to handle a disaster of a massive scale. But we didn't have a plan for something this big.Wittaya Tantawanich - on Patong beachI got a request to go to a supermarket on the beach road where many people were trapped inside. When I arrived, I saw staff floating face down in the water that flooded the basement of the building. Some of them were still alive but many of them were dead.Samran Chanyang - at Yan Yao templeI turned on the TV and saw what happened in my area. I didn't know about the tsunami until then. I was shocked and worried since my son had gone to work in Khao Lak [on the mainland coast north of Phuket]. He was a painter and it was meant to be the last working day for him before a long break. I contacted him, but I was unable to reach him.Primpraow Jitpentom - on diving tripWe decided to head toward Phi Phi island as it wasn't too far and they had been badly hit. When we arrived, it wasn't something I expected. All I saw were dead bodies floating in the water.Wittaya TantawanichAs we tried to help more people in the supermarket, I heard from outside that another wave was coming. I was looking for the nearest way out but I knew I wouldn't be able to make it. So I closed my eyes, prayed, and prepared to die. Luckily, it came up to street level and stopped.Dr Weerawit SarideepanHundreds of people were sent in. Most of them had broken bones or cuts on their bodies. Then dead bodies started to come in. Samran Chanyang - at Yan Yao templeMy son's three friends told me he was missing. I was about to go out looking for him but then the hospital contacted me. They said they needed a place to put dead bodies from the wave so I had to be on standby at the temple waiting for the hospital to deliver the bodies. By 19:00, hundreds of dead bodies start to arrive. We had no place for them so they were wrapped in plastic and white sheets before laying on the ground all over the temple.Dr Weerawit SarideepanThe hospital director asked me to go to help implant microchips into the dead bodies as requested by the forensic police. When I first arrived, the local police took me to Wat Yan Yao, where there were thousands of dead bodies waiting to be identified. As I stepped into the temple, I could smell dead bodies the way I never had before in my life. I noticed the temple ground covered in blood and lymph.Primpraow Jitpentom - on diving tripWe decided to help only the injured survivors and we finally rescued at least 414 tourists and locals, and transferred them to a more equipped hospital on Phuket. We were happy to help many people that day.Samran ChanyangThe following day, more bodies start to come in. The military started to bring in containers to keep the bodies in. By the middle of the second day, I saw a mountain of dead bodies piling up and it was very sad to see.Samran ChanyangI went out with my other sons and friends to look for my eldest son. It took me half a day to find him. He was trapped and died inside the building where he was.Wittaya Tantawanich - on Patong beachI'd been a rescue worker all my life but I'd never experienced anything that huge before.Captain Sathaporn SawangpukIt was a wave like no other."
278,Somkid Pumpuang: Thai serial killer spotted on train thanks to scar,"A couple who spotted a notorious Thai serial killer on a train because of the distinctive scar on his forehead have led police to arrest him.Somkid Pumpuang, 55, was released early from prison in May, where he was serving life for murdering five people.He was back on Thailand's wanted list on suspicion of killing a sixth person in Khon Kaen on Sunday.Thai police launched a manhunt after the latest killing - that of a 51-year-old woman, Ratsami Mulichan.The young couple, who have not been named for safety reasons, sat opposite Somkid after boarding the train at 08:37 (01:37 GMT) on Wednesday morning.The woman noticed the passenger had a scar over his left eyebrow, which was the same as that in the photo used in wanted posters.The couple left to sit elsewhere, but when the woman explained why she felt uneasy, her boyfriend went back to the seat to take a photo of the man - which he then sent to the police station.As the train pulled into Pak Chong station at about 10:45, officers boarded the train and arrested Somkid.The boyfriend said the scar ""confirmed to me that the man was Somkid"", he told Thai TV.Before his arrest, police described Somkid as a ""dangerous man"".Officials allege that Somkid befriended Ms Ratsami on Facebook by pretending to be a lawyer, and moved into her home on 2 December. Two weeks later, she was found dead in her home, the Bangkok Post newspaper reported.Chinese 'Jack the Ripper' executedNotorious serial killer 'found' after 30 yearsFBI names America's deadliest serial killerSomkid was convicted for carrying out the original five murders in 2005.

However, he was released on parole in May this year for good behaviour while in prison."
279,Brothers ran UK-wide drugs ring from Wirral base,"Two brothers who oversaw a UK-wide drugs ring that made MDMA, cocaine and cannabis have been jailed.Ringleader Joseph Mulhare, 44, and Gregory Mulhare, 39, were arrested in an armed raid in Thailand last year.The men, who ran the operation from their base in Wirral, both pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply Class A and Class B drugs, police said.They were responsible for ""bringing misery to potentially thousands of people"", Det Ch Insp Ian Hussey said.Joseph Mulhare, of Birkenhead, Wirral, was sentenced to 15 years and four months and Gregory Mulhare, of no fixed abode, was jailed for 12 years and eight months at Liverpool Crown Court.Video footage of the brothers being arrested by Thai immigration police in Pattaya last year showed police armed with pistols and automatic weapons storm a room, where the brothers were sharing a bed.Officers from the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit (NWROCU) seized drugs worth more than £820,000, alongside £80,000 in cash and a stun gun, during the 18-month investigation.They uncovered the ""extensive commercial scale production"" of amphetamines, MDMA, ecstasy, cocaine and cannabis, Merseyside police said.Det Ch Insp Ian Hussey said it was ""a long and challenging investigation"".""Neither of these men were hands-on in the production of the drugs but they were responsible for orchestrating and organising the nationwide distribution (and) were also the ones who benefitted the most financially from their illicit business dealings,"" he said.Twenty-one men who were part of the drugs ring were sentenced in December last year."
280,Unesco heritage: Traditional Thai massage added to 'cultural heritage' list,"The back-cracking traditional Thai massage has been added to a prestigious Unesco heritage list.Nuad Thai is now part of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, which features traditions and practices passed across the generations.By being part of the list, Thai massage has been recognised as something to be preserved for future generations.Unesco is the United Nations' agency for education, culture, and science.The intangible cultural heritage list is separate from the world heritage list, which recognises buildings and sites of prominence. There are 550 items on the cultural heritage list - split into three categories - from 127 countries.Items are added every year, with this year's committee meeting in Bogota, Colombia.Unlike conventional massages, Thai massages involve a lot of movement and typically sees people assuming a series of different positions. Therapists use not only their hands but sometimes their forearms and knees to apply pressure. There is also no oil involved in Nuad Thai massage. According to Unesco, the practice has its ""roots in self-care in Thai peasant society of the past, [where] every village had massage healers whom villagers would turn to when they had muscle aches from working the field"".Other practices added to this year's list include:Irish harpingCelestinian forgiveness in ItalyThe Carnival of Podence in PortugalSilat self-defence in MalaysiaAccording to Unesco, the intangible culture heritage list seeks to recognise things that are ""important to preserve for future generations... [like] songs sung and stories told"". It adds that these things ""form part of a heritage and this requires active effort to safeguard it"". "
281,Tesco considers sale of Thai and Malaysian operations,"The UK's biggest retailer, Tesco, is considering a retreat from markets in Asia with the sale of its profitable operations in Thailand and Malaysia.Analysts say the 2,000 stores, which operate under the Tesco Lotus brand, could be worth more than £7bn.Tesco's only other overseas stores are in Ireland and in central Europe, including Poland and Hungary.The company said it was reviewing its Thai and much smaller Malaysian arms after interest from potential bidders.In a statement, the retailer said it had had received ""inbound interest"", but did not name the potential buyer or buyers. Tesco Lotus employs about 60,000 people.The statement also said the review was at an early stage, and ""no decisions concerning the future of Tesco Thailand or Malaysia have been taken"".The Asian operation, which had combined revenues of £4.9bn, was a ""trophy asset"" and likely to achieve a knock-out price, said Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital.A valuation of £6.5bn to £7.2bn seemed ""fair"", according to Bruno Monteyne, analyst at Bernstein.Laura Lambie, senior investment director at Investec Wealth and Investment, told the BBC's Today programme that Thailand was an important market for Tesco.While Tesco had already withdrawn from ""more mature markets"" such as the US, Japan and Turkey, it had recently announced plans to open another 750 stores in Thailand, she said.Margins in Thailand were also higher, at 6%, compared with 3% for the UK, she added. ""There will have to be a fairly high asking price for Tesco to be prepared to let it go.""Tesco boss Dave Lewis in shock departureTesco chain Jack's takes on Aldi and LidlTesco to cut 4,500 jobs across 153 Metro storesThe announcement signals another potential pullback by Tesco from its once-ambitious global expansion.If a sale does go ahead it would mean the company would be left with stores in the UK and Ireland, and its division in central Europe. That unit covers the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia.Tesco has been shifting its focus as part of a turnaround programme launched five years ago.The plan was in response to an accounting scandal, and in the face of competition from rival supermarket chains and online competitors.The retail giant has shed several businesses across the world in recent years.Tesco has withdrawn from the US, Japan, and China. In 2015, it sold its South Korean unit for $6.1bn, and a year later offloaded its Kipa business in Turkey, the country's largest supermarket chain.It has also been shedding assets in the UK to focus on its core grocery business. In 2016, it sold the Giraffe restaurant chain just three years after buying it for £49m.In October this year, Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis surprised investors by saying he would stand down ""in the summer of 2020"".He took over the top job at the company in 2014, shortly before it was revealed that the retailer had overstated its profits."
282,"Thai deer found dead with 7kg of 'underwear, plastic bags' in stomach","A wild deer which died at a national park in northern Thailand was found to have 7kg (15 lbs) of rubbish inside its stomach, say officials. Men's underwear, plastic bags, instant coffee sachets and parts of plastic rope were among the things found inside the male deer's stomach.A Khun Sathan National Park official said the deer had been eating plastic for a ""long time"" before it died.Earlier this year, a baby dugong in Thailand died after eating plastic. Mariam the dugong won hearts in Thailand after photos of her rescue went viral. But she died just months after, with an autopsy showing that plastic had caused obstructions in her stomach. On 25 November, an officer who was on patrol found the 10-year-old male deer in the Khun Sathan National Park in the northern district of Na Noi.Also found in its stomach were rubber gloves, instant noodles and a small towel.""We believed it had been eating those plastics for a long time before it died,"" Kriangsak Thanompun, a director at the National Park, Wildlife and Plant Conservation Department told BBC News Thai. ""Officials [believe] the plastics had blocked up its alimentary canal [but a] further investigation [will be] launched."" On social media, many criticised park-goers who had littered.""When you go into a national park, take your rubbish back.

283,World War Two prisoner mended Japanese guards' watches to survive,"The story of a soldier who survived World War Two imprisonment by mending his guards' watches has been revealed.Albert Norman repaired his Japanese captors' watches ""just enough to keep them ticking"" during three years of brutal treatment.His family spotted him in a 1938 photograph of the Cambridgeshire Regiment after Ely Museum appealed for help in matching names to faces. The museum hopes to feature his story as part of its £2.2m redevelopment.The uncaptioned photograph shows more than 80 men in Ely Company, part of the territorial regiment's first battalion, just before the outbreak of World War Two. The battalion was captured at Singapore in 1942 and Mr Norman was among the prisoners-of-war who endured more than three years of cruel and sadistic treatment. The private's granddaughter Vicki Slaughter said he had been a watch-maker in the family business in Ely.""After capture he'd fix the watches of the guards - just enough to keep them ticking,"" she said.""He'd also set the watches to run just slightly slower so that they would be late and get in trouble.""Mrs Slaughter believes the guards gave him extra food in return for the repairs - he was also the camp cook.Unlike a quarter of the Allied prisoners-of-war, Mr Norman - who was nicknamed Tick-Tock - survived to return home and lived into his 70s.Railway Man red carpet for PoWBurma veterans' last county serviceWW2 People's War - Burma StarFelix Jackson, co-founder of the Cambridgeshire Regiment Research Trust, said: ""Despite knowing the details of most of those who served in the regiment, there are still many that we have no known photographs of.""This project is enabling us to add names to several familiar faces.""Emily Allen, Ely Museum's community engagement officer, is appealing for more relatives to come forward.

Mr Thanathorn said the charges against him were politically motivated.He had insisted that he sold his shares in the company - V-Luck Media - to his mother before he registered as a candidate, but the court said there was no evidence proving this.Mr Thanathorn was not given a jail term or banned from running for public office as some of his supporters had feared. Future Forward came third in the elections with 6.2 million votes, and Mr Thanathorn has since emerged as the main voice of opposition to the military-dominated government.

285,Gunmen kill 15 in southern Thailand's 'biggest attack' in recent years,"Suspected separatists have killed at least 15 people and injured four in southern Thailand, in one of the country's worst attacks in years.Police officers were among those killed at the attack on a security checkpoint in Yala province.The attackers used explosives and then scattered nails on roads in an attempt to slow down people chasing after them.Thousands have been killed in southern Thailand since a separatist insurgency gripped the region in 2004.The attack took place on Tuesday night - Yala is one of three provinces in the region that have often been hit by violence.Separatist insurgents are believed to have targeted a security checkpoint, killing at least 15 people - including a police officer and numerous village defence volunteers.These volunteers are usually civilians who have been trained to use weapons and are tasked with protecting the village.Some of the injured remain critically ill, according to the BBC's Thai Service. There is still no evidence as to who was behind the attack, but Colonel Pramote Prom-in, a regional security spokesman, told Reuters that it was ""likely the work of insurgents"".""This is one of the biggest attacks in recent times,"" he said. The separatist rebels seek some form of independence in southern Thailand.To understand why, you have to go back at least 100 years.The southern region used to be a sultanate known as Patani. Most people who lived in Patani were Malay Muslims. But at the beginning of the 20th Century, Patani became part of Thailand.""[The Malay Muslims were] different from most people in the rest of Thailand, whether culturally, ethnically or religiously,"" Rungrawee Chalermsripinyorat, an independent analyst based in Australia, told BBC News. These Malay Muslims fought ""against cultural assimilation, [but were met] with strong state suppression"", she said. Technically, they've never stopped. But violence in southern Thailand had relatively calmed down - until 2004. In that year, gunmen raided a military arms depot, killing the four guards and making off with about 400 assault rifles. Waves of attacks blamed on ethnic-Malay separatists would later follow. The fight has not stopped since, though there are spikes in the violence as well as periods of lulls.Tuesday's attack is said to be the biggest in years in terms of casualties, but it's still not clear who carried it out and why. Ms Chalermsripinyorat suggested the attack could have been carried out by Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN), one of three main separatist groups in the region.""While there is no solid evidence... this style of attack and choice of target fits the pattern the BRN has previously used,"" she said.Putting a face to the conflict in Thailand's southThai youth orchestra plays on to defy bloodshedBut could it be a signal that violence in southern Thailand might be returning to the levels of 2004? ""I think it is unlikely to signify a return to the full-fledged military battle [of] several years ago,"" said Ms Chalermsripinyorat. ""It may just be a normal military operation to remind people of [the group's] existence and military might."" More than 7,000 people in southern Thailand have died since the conflict between the insurgents and authorities resumed in 2004, said Deep South Watch, a group that monitors the violence.""It had received little attention internationally [but] it is not an exaggeration to say this is the most deadly conflict in South East Asia,"" said Ms Chalermsripinyorat. But it's not just Thailand that has cause for concern. She adds that Thailand's neighbours Malaysia are ""afraid of the spill over effect"" and that the conflict could cause ""penetration by transnational jihad groups"". ""Secessionist conflicts elsewhere have shown that the longer a conflict is prolonged, the more complicated the situation becomes,"" she said. ""It can then become a fertile ground for unwanted elements."""

291,Thailand royal consort: How did Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi fall from grace?,"Thailand's king stunned observers on Monday by stripping his royal consort of her rank and titles, just months after she was granted the honours. It was only in July when Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi was named as ""official consort"" alongside the new queen - but the palace said she was punished for trying to elevate herself to ""the same state as the queen"".For some observers her downfall says as much about the direction of Thailand's monarchy as it does about her alleged offences.The new monarch, King Maha Vajiralongkorn, ascended the throne in 2016 when his father died - the country's lese-majeste law forbids any criticism of the monarchy and carries a hefty prison sentence.A consort generally refers to a wife, husband or companion of a reigning monarch - but in this case in Thailand ""royal consort"" was used as a term for a companion or partner in addition to the king's wife.Sineenat, 34, was the first royal consort in Thailand for almost a century. When she was given the title in July, it made her an official companion - but not a queen - of the king shortly after he married his fourth wife, Queen Suthida.Historically, polygamy and the taking of royal consorts was used by Thailand's royals to assure the allegiance of powerful families across the provinces of the large kingdom.Thai kings throughout the centuries took multiple wives - or consorts. The last time a Thai king took an official consort was in the 1920s and the title has not been used since the country became a constitutional monarchy in 1932. Information on her background is sketchy except for biographical information released by the court at the time. ""We only know about her past whatever the royal household wanted us to know,"" explains Pavin Chachavalpongpun, Associate Professor of Southeast Asian Studies at Kyoto University. Born in 1985, she is from northern Thailand and first worked as a nurse. Once in a relationship with the then-crown prince Vajiralongkorn, her life became woven into the royal military and security apparatus.Rare photos of Thai king’s consort releasedProfile: Thailand's King VajiralongkornThailand's lese-majeste law explained She became a bodyguard, pilot, parachutist and joined the royal guards. Earlier this year, she was appointed a major-general.  The array of honours and titles given by the court was topped by her becoming the first Royal Noble Consort in nearly a century in July. Shortly afterwards she was notably pictured posing in a fighter jet when the palace released a series of action images of her along with an official biography. These have now been removed from the official website.Sineenat has been stripped of her rank and titles for ""misbehaviour and disloyalty against the monarch,"" according to a detailed official announcement in the royal court's gazette.The statement said she had been ""ambitious"" and tried to ""elevate herself to the same state as the queen"".""The royal consort's behaviours were considered disrespectful,"" showing ""disobedience against the king and the queen"" and abusing her power to give orders on the king's behalf.The king, the statement said, had learned ""she neither was grateful to the title bestowed upon her, nor did she behave appropriately according to her status"".Tamara Loos, professor of history and Thai studies at Cornell University, suggests the lack of transparency over what exactly happened is key to understanding it.""In any situation like that you find a system of patronage behind the scenes. Sineenat might have been part of that system of patronage and she might have played it in a way that didn't work well for her,"" she says, hinting at possible factionalism in the court. She adds that the language of the declaration setting out her demotion is ""reminiscent of an era in which women could not have direct political power and so the ways you talked about women with 'influence' was that they were ambitious"".For Ms Loos, the statement is in line with what she identifies as the ""rise of a modern absolute monarchy in Thailand"".  So far, the fallen consort has only been stripped of her titles and it's unclear what more awaits her. ""We have no idea what will happen to her,"" explains Mr Pavin, who adds that the proceedings are unlikely to be transparent. As much as the narrative of her past was controlled by the court, the same will likely be the case for her future. The sudden demotion of  Sineenat has echoes of what happened to two of King Vajiralongkorn's former wives.In 1996, he denounced his second wife, Sujarinee Vivacharawongse - who fled to the United States - and disowned four sons he had with her.In 2014, his third wife Srirasmi Suwadee - whose whereabouts are unknown -  was stripped of all her titles and banished from court while her parents were arrested and imprisoned for lese-majeste. Their son, who is now 14, has been brought up by him. His previous wives have never issued any statements about their particular circumstances.Since coming to power, King Vajiralongkorn has exercised his powers in a more direct way than his father. Earlier this year, the two most important army units in the capital Bangkok were placed directly under his command, showing a concentration of military power in royal hands unprecedented in modern Thailand.""The brutal and blunt language used by the court to denounce Sineenat is how the king wants to legitimise the punishment for her,"" explains Mr Pavin. Ms Loos agrees the king is sending a message that goes beyond just falling out with his mistress.""The king is sending a signal that he can't be touched and that once you're out of favour with him, you have no control over your destiny.""Each move of his, whether economic, military or familial, reveals his unfettered abuse of power,"" she adds. Under the country's lese-majeste law, the controversial demotion cannot be discussed publicly in the country - but observers believe this dramatic fall from grace will be uppermost in many people's minds.

It marked a sudden fall from grace for the royal consort, who for several years was seen often at the side of King Vajiralongkorn. Even after the king's marriage to Queen Suthida, Sineenat was a regular guest at royal events.The statement published on Monday said Sineenat had ""shown resistance and pressure in every manner to stop the appointment of the Queen"" ahead of the coronation in May. ""The king gave her a royal consort position, in hopes of relieving the pressure and a problem that could affect the monarchy,"" the statement said.It also accused the royal consort of ""resistance against the king and the queen"" and of abusing her power to give orders on the king's behalf.The king, the statement said, had learnt ""she neither was grateful to the title bestowed upon her, nor did she behave appropriately according to her status"".He ordered her stripped of all royal titles, decorations, status in the royal guard and her military ranks.King Vajiralongkorn ascended the throne after the death of his father in 2016.He has had four wives - Princess Soamsawali from 1977 to 1993; Yuvadhida Polpraserth from 1994 to 1996; Srirasmi Suwadee between 2001 and 2014; and Queen Suthida. The true cause of Sineenat's removal as royal consort may never be made public, given the secrecy which cloaks palace affairs in Thailand. The nation's lese-majeste law forbids any insult of the monarchy and is among the strictest in the world.The removal of Sineenat echoes the cases of two of the King's former wives. In 1996, he denounced his second wife, who fled to the United States, and disowned four sons he had with her. In 2014, his third wife Srirasmi Suwadee was similarly stripped of all her titles and banished from court. Her 14-year-old son has been raised by King Vajiralongkorn in Germany and Switzerland. The King has also exercised his royal powers in a more direct way than his recent predecessors. Earlier this month, the two most important army units in the capital, Bangkok were placed directly under his command - a concentration of military power in royal hands unprecedented in modern Thailand."

296,Thai elephant deaths: Do elephants risk their lives to save each other?,"Last week, Thailand suffered one of its biggest ever single elephant tragedies, when 11 animals in one family died in a swollen river.At first only six elephants were thought to have died - days later another five were spotted downstream. The initial theory from park rangers in Khao Yai National Park was that they died in a rescue mission. As they crossed the treacherous 150m-tall Haew Narok - or Hell's Falls - a baby slipped and the others fell trying to save it. Though the loss of 11 elephants isn't catastrophic to the species, there is something about them that draws us in, and this apparent self-sacrifice struck a chord around the world - millions of you read our story alone.But emotions aside, how plausible is it that elephants would have both the empathy and skill to risk their lives for a baby? And perhaps more importantly now, what does this mean for the survivors?Dr Joshua Plotnik, assistant professor of psychology at Hunter College City University of New York, has been studying elephants in Thailand for more than a decade. He told the BBC that with no witnesses, we can't assume what happened. But he says it's ""certainly reasonable to suspect that when an elephant in a family group is in danger the other elephants might do everything they can to go help"".There is well documented evidence of elephants recognising danger and co-ordinating their actions to stage a rescue.But Dr Plotnik says it seems unlikely that they would ""actively all go over a waterfall in a dangerous situation like that"". It was more likely a terrible accident.Dr Rachel Dale, an elephant behaviour specialist at the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna, agrees that elephants will unquestionably help an elephant in danger, ""even if it's at a cost to themselves"". But they're also ""smart animals, really smart"", she says, so probably have the ability to carry out a kind of perfunctory risk assessment before rushing in. Bhichet Noonto leads the Thailand Human-Elephant Coexistence Project at the office of Thailand Science Research and Innovation, studying patterns of elephant behaviour. He said conditions in the park were miserable at the time of the accident, and Haew Narok was already a known hazard to elephants in the monsoon season. In 1992, eight elephants died after tumbling over the same falls - park officials have said they witnessed a mother on that occasion jump in after a baby. A calf is also suspected of having fallen off a cliff there in 1987. To prevent further accidents, park officials constructed miles of concrete pillars to steer them away from hazardous places. But they couldn't cover everywhere, and the rangers have seen footsteps indicating this group had followed one fence all the way up the falls until they found a way through, right at the top. Banning trophy hunting 'doesn't protect animals'More than a quarter of UK mammals face extinctionUsing polar bear footprints to chart family treesThe Department of National Parks, Wildlife, and Plant Conservation (DNP) said the elephants may have been looking for a particular local plant, which only grows in that area once a year, and they may have taken a risk to reach it.  Alternatively, they may have gone out of their way to avoid interacting with humans.   ""There are many types of elephants: polite, naughty, and nice just like humans. When some of them walk outside of the routes that they are used to, they have a high risk of falling,"" said DNP director Songtham Suksawang.In another emotional twist, two elephants are known to have survived the fall - a mother and calf. They were trapped by the slippery rocks at the bottom, but with the help of park officials made it to safety.If elephants do indeed have the empathy and intelligence to understand when one of their kind is in danger and try to save them, what does that mean for these survivors?""This is a large-brained, intelligent, social, empathetic animal,"" says Dr Plotnik. ""I would argue they would suffer the same kind of trauma we would suffer.""The exact relationship between the family members is not yet known, but if their matriarchal leader was among the dead, they'll have lost decades of vital knowledge about their jungle home.Because elephant lives are about as long as ours and they rely on generational knowledge, Dr Dale explains, it could take a very long time to see the effect of this kind of loss and whether it changes their behaviour or traditional routes. But park officials are confident the pair have the skills to survive and will learn from their experience to avoid the falls.Mr Noonto says reports from the area suggest there may be more family members elsewhere that the two survivors can reunite with. Failing that, they may be taken in by another family group - studies of captive elephants being returned to the wild have shown this is possible, he says.""They can survive, they can adapt,"" he says. ""Perhaps they will even encounter males to rebuild the family.""There is undeniably an allure about elephants, an animal humans have built a relationship with over millennia. Despite their vast size, they are mostly gentle, live in families like us, appear to have fun, and we can watch them apparently mourn. It's easy for us to empathise after a disaster like Khao Yai. Dr Dale argues that anthropomorphism doesn't ultimately help the elephants, though. ""Humans are good at certain things that help us survive,"" she says. ""What helps us survive doesn't always help other animals to survive. So seeing things always through the human lens doesn't help us to understand other species and what other animals need to thrive.""By setting emotion aside and dispassionately assessing what makes them think and act the way they do, scientists can better determine how to prevent disasters like this.Cases like this might be rare, says Dr Plotnik, but they are a reminder that even for an animal as huge as the elephant, ""the wild is not a friendly place"". The bodies of this group will be recovered and examined, then buried at the park. They will be remembered every year, in the park's memorial services for its beloved lost elephants. ""It's very sad for [park officials] because they didn't want this to happen again,"" says Mr Noonto. ""This is very emotional for Thai people."""

298,Thailand elephant deaths: Drone spots five more victims,"The number of elephants that died after falling down a waterfall in Thailand has increased to 11. It is thought the animals may have been trying to save a baby elephant that slipped over the edge.Local authorities at the Khao Yai National Park in central Thailand initially spotted only six dead elephants over the weekend. The additional five were spotted by drone near the notorious fall known as Haew Narok (Hell's Fall).The dead elephants included a three-year-old calf, park officials said at the weekend, according to the Reuters news agency. ""We understand that the elephants were trying to cross over to the other side of the river,"" local official Badin Chansrikam told the agency.""Probably, one of the smaller elephants might have slid and the adult ones were trying to rescue them but instead, were swept away by the water.""Nine reasons why we love elephantsSix elephants die trying to save each otherPoacher trampled by elephant, eaten by lionsElephant tourism is 'fuelling cruelty'According to local media though, the reason the animals fell into the strong current is not known. When the first six dead animals were discovered at the weekend, two surviving elephants were found struggling on a rock. Park rangers lowered food laced with supplements to the stranded animals to help them regain strength and climb back into the forest. But experts warn their long-term survival may be difficult as elephants rely on large herds for protection and finding food.The incident could also take an emotional toll. Elephants have been known to display signs of grief.There are around 300 wild elephants in the park, which is  home to various wild animals, including bears and gibbons, and is a popular destination for tourists.  National park officers are trying to retrieve the bodies from the river as there are fears the carcasses might contaminate the water. According to the Bangkok Post, the new death toll makes it one of the biggest losses to Thailand's elephant population in recent memory. The Haew Narok waterfall has a history of similar incidents.

299,Six elephants die trying to save each other at Thai waterfall,"Six elephants have fallen to their deaths in Thailand while trying to save each other from a notorious waterfall.Officials said the incident occurred after a baby elephant slipped over the waterfall in central Thailand's Khao Yai National Park.Two other elephants were also found struggling on a cliff edge nearby, and have been moved by Thai authorities. The waterfall, known as Haew Narok (Hell's Fall), has a history of similar incidents.A herd of eight elephants died after falling in 1992, in a case that brought national attention.Thailand's Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation (DNP) said officials were called to the scene on Saturday at 03:00 local time (20:00 GMT on Friday) when a group of elephants was blocking a road by the waterfall.Three hours later, the body of a three-year-old elephant was spotted near the base of Haew Narok, and five others were discovered nearby.Khanchit Srinoppawan, chief of the national park, told the BBC that the two remaining elephants were being monitored.World Elephant Day: Nine reasons why we love elephantsPoacher trampled by elephant, eaten by lionsEdwin Wiek, the founder of Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand, said the pair may have difficulty surviving as elephants rely on their large herds for protection and finding food.The incident could also take an emotional toll.

300,Thailand judge shoots himself in court after criticising system,"A Thai judge shot himself in a courtroom after delivering a rare speech railing against the country's justice system. Kanakorn Pianchana acquitted five Muslim men of murder on Friday before calling for a fairer judiciary.  He then recited a legal oath, pulled out a pistol and shot himself in the chest.But the judge survived and was rushed to hospital where he is recovering from his injuries. A statement believed to have been written by the judge before giving his ruling suggests that his suicide attempt could have been related to alleged interference in the case. The judge worked at the Yala court in the insurgency-hit south of Thailand.After acquitting the five men of murder and firearms offences, he addressed the court with an impassioned speech that he broadcast live on Facebook.""You need clear and credible evidence to punish someone. So if you're not sure, don't punish them,"" he said.""I'm not saying that the five defendants didn't commit the crimes, they might have done so,"" he added.""But the judicial process needs to be transparent and credible... punishing the wrong people makes them scapegoats.""The Facebook feed then cut but people in court said the judge read out a legal oath in front of the former Thai king's portrait before whipping out a pistol and shooting himself. He was rushed to hospital where he is reported to be in a stable condition. It is not fully clear why Judge Pianchana attempted to take his own life.Suriyan Hongvilai, the spokesman of the Office of the Judiciary, told the AFP news agency he shot himself due to ""personal stress"".But local media reported that the judge could have been referring to the case he had just ruled on. A statement believed to have been written by the judge and posted to Facebook before he shot himself stated that he had been pressured to find the men guilty despite lack of evidence. ""At this moment, other fellow judges in Courts of First Instance across the country are being treated the same way as I was,"" he wrote. ""[If] I cannot keep my oath of office, I'd rather die than live without honour."" Criticism of the judicial system by judges is extremely rare in Thailand. Rights groups have alleged that security forces trump up charges against Muslim suspects in the Malay-Muslim majority region."
301,Thailand dead elephants: Officials try to retrieve bodies,"Officials are trying to retrieve the bodies of six elephants that fell to their deaths while trying to save each other from a waterfall in Thailand, warning that they pose a water contamination risk. Khao Yai National Park officers have set up a net downstream from the bodies to stop them from reaching a major dam.The elephants died after falling from a notorious waterfall known as Haew Narok (Hell's Fall). Two others were rescued on Saturday. Thailand's Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation (DNP) said officials were called to the scene on Saturday at 03:00 local time (20:00 GMT on Friday) when a group of elephants was seen blocking a road by the waterfall.Nine reasons why we love elephantsPoacher trampled by elephant, eaten by lionsEscaped zebra shot in Germany after autobahn chaosThree hours later, the body of a three-year-old elephant was spotted near the base of Haew Narok, and five others were discovered nearby.The two surviving elephants were found struggling on a rock. A park official told the BBC on Monday that officers had been monitoring their tracks and were confident they were safe, but experts have warned that their long-term survival may be difficult as elephants rely on large herds for protection and finding food.""The next mission is how to take the carcasses from the river. Six of them are still in the river and the river is very strong now,"" the official said. ""We are using rope across the river and have a lot of people helping together to retrieve the carcasses.""Edwin Wiek, founder of Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand, told the BBC the rescuers ""hope to get the carcasses to an area where they can lift them with a backhoe (an excavating digger) and bury them there.""""The decomposing bodies will be too smelly and spread of disease is a concern,"" he added.Saturday's incident is not the first of its kind at Haew Narok. A herd of eight elephants died after falling from the waterfall in 1992, in a case that brought national attention.Officials are now seeking to prevent further incidents from happening in the future.Natural Resources and Environment Minister Varawut Silpa-archa has ordered the construction of a barricade to stop animals from falling into the waterfall and called for food banks to be set up around the park in an effort to prevent food scarcity which can cause animals to approach dangerous spots, according to the Bangkok Post."

304,Blue Diamond Affair: The mystery of the stolen Saudi jewels,"The theft of precious jewels from a Saudi palace in 1989 set off a chain of killings and a diplomatic crisis that continues to this day. Now, in a rare interview, the man behind the theft tells his story.The Saudi prince and his wife were away on holiday for three months, and the thief knew this was the time to strike.Kriangkrai Techamong was running a significant risk. Stealing could be punished with amputation in Saudi Arabia, but Kriangkrai's was no ordinary theft - he had his eye on dozens of precious gems and jewels owned by his employer Prince Faisal, the eldest son of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.As a cleaner, Kriangkrai had come to know every corner of Prince Faisal's palace. And he had learned that three of the four safes containing the prince's jewels were regularly left unlocked. It was too good an opportunity to miss: he was struggling with gambling debt he had built up on the site where the palace workers lived, and this was a golden chance to flee the repressive country where he could no longer bear to live.One evening, he made up an excuse to be inside the palace after dark. He waited until other staff had left, and sneaked into the prince's bedroom. He picked some jewels and stuck them to his body using duct tape. He also stored gems inside cleaning equipment, including vacuum bags.By the end, he had taken almost 30kg (66lbs) of loot, valued at close to $20m. Among the pilfered items, Saudi officials would later say, were gold watches and several plump rubies.That night, Kriangkrai hid the valuables all over the palace, in places he knew they would not be discovered. And then, over a month, he moved them and hid them in the middle of a large cargo delivery he was sending home to Thailand.By the time the theft was discovered, Kriangkrai had already fled to his native Thailand, with his cargo leaving a few days before him. But the thief faced another challenge: how to get the stolen goods through Thai customs. All items imported from abroad had to be checked as they entered the country. But because he knew Thai officials could not resist a bribe, Kriangkrai stuffed an envelope with money and a note and put it in his cargo. The note said his cargo had pornographic material inside, and he would prefer it not to be searched.His plan worked, but Kriangkrai could evade justice for only so long. In January 1990, he was arrested at his home in Thailand's northern Lampang province after the Thai police were alerted by their Saudi counterparts.The gems and jewels - some of which he had kept, some of which he had sold - were retrieved soon afterwards. But some time in between their retrieval and their return to Riyadh, another crime occurred. Saudi officials said about 80% were missing, and many of those that had been returned were fake. Then, photographs started circulating of the wife of one senior Thai official wearing a necklace with an uncanny resemblance to one of the missing items.It was the disappearance of one piece in particular that caused consternation, however: a rare 50-carat blue diamond the size of an egg.Only about 1 in 10,000 diamonds has a distinct body colour, says Alan Hart, the CEO of the Gemmological Association of Great Britain. Of those, just a tiny minority are blue, ensuring they are among the rarest and most valuable in the world. Their distinct colour comes from the faint traces of boron inside, an element present when the diamond was formed up to 600km (370 miles) below the Earth's surface.Many of the blue diamonds in circulation today come from one source - the Cullinan mine near Pretoria in South Africa - but the origin story of the Saudi blue diamond is unclear and no known photographs of it exist.Read the story of the blue diamond in ThaiThe case might have ended with Kriangkrai jailed for under three years and Saudi Arabia decrying the disappearance of the prince's jewels, and the blue diamond in particular. Instead, the investigation took a bloody turn.In early February 1990, two officials from the visa section of the Saudi embassy in Bangkok were driving towards the compound in the Thai capital. About a half a mile from their destination, their car was attacked by gunmen and both men were killed. At about the same time, another gunman entered the apartment of one of the men's colleagues and shot him dead.Weeks afterwards, a Saudi businessman, Mohammad al-Ruwaili, was despatched to Bangkok to investigate what might have happened to the missing hoard. But he too was targeted - he was kidnapped and, while his body has never been found, he is widely believed to have been murdered.Plenty of theories about the killings exist. According to a diplomatic note written in 2010 by the deputy chief of mission in the US embassy in Bangkok, and later released by Wikileaks, the killings of the three diplomats ""almost certainly were part of a Saudi feud with Hezbollah"", the Lebanese Shia Muslim militant group.But one Saudi official in particular was clear about who was responsible.Mohammed Said Khoja, a Saudi diplomat of 35 years' experience, was sent to Bangkok soon after the theft to oversee the investigation. After expecting to be in Thailand for only three months, he ended up staying for several years.His role was technically not that of an ambassador, but of the lesser charge d'affaires. This was because Saudi Arabia had downgraded its relations with Thailand after the theft and murders, a move that saw the number of Thai workers in Saudi Arabia drop from more than 200,000 to only 15,000. This reportedly cost the Thai economy - so dependent on relatives sending money home - billions of dollars a year. Relations between the two countries are barely any better today.Khoja, a stern moustachioed man, would give press interviews with his Smith & Wesson gun on the desk next to him, insisting that the Thai police were out to get him. His interviews, which would feature on the front pages of Thai newspapers, were unusually candid for a diplomat.He would openly accuse the Thai police of stealing the recovered haul, and of killing the Saudi diplomats and businessman to cover up their own embezzlement. The men were killed, he said, because they had uncovered sensitive information about the theft. The police officer in charge of the investigation into the diplomats' killings was charged with Mohammad al-Ruwaili's disappearance, but the charges were later dropped.""The police here are bigger than the government itself,"" Khoja told the New York Times in September 1994. ""I am a Muslim, and I stay because I feel I am fighting the devils.""The Bombshell Bandit: How a well-dressed bank robber captivated the USDeath in Ice Valley: Who was the woman found dead in remote Norway?Stolen by black magic: One of the boldest confidence tricks of all timeIran's chain murders: ""We understood that they wanted to kill us all""The uncatchable: How Greece's most wanted man became a folk heroThis interview was one of many he gave in the same month, and it came soon after another killing linked to the theft. Under growing pressure from Saudi Arabia, Thailand was looking for a resolution to the case. It had identified the man thought to have handled the hoard of gems and jewels after Kriangkrai returned to Thailand. The Thai gem dealer was believed to have sold the goods and replaced them with fakes, and he ended up becoming the key witness in the case.But in July 1994, his wife and son disappeared and their bodies were later found in a Mercedes outside Bangkok. While there were signs of blunt force trauma on their corpses, a forensic report said they had died after their car was hit by a large truck. Khoja gave another round of interviews. ""The forensic commander thinks we're stupid,"" he said in a press conference. ""This was not an accident. They want to cover it up.""Khoja was right. It would later emerge that police tasked with finding the missing jewels had instead embezzled some of it, extorted the gem dealer, and murdered his wife and son. The police chief in charge of the original investigation, Chalor Kerdthes, ended up serving 20 years in prison.Kriangkrai is nervous. It is 28 years since he was released from prison, 30 years since his daring theft, and now he is back living in north-west Thailand. Over several days, a team from the BBC's Thai service has been following one tip after another as to his whereabouts, and has finally traced him down to his modest home.As his eyes dart from right to left, his paranoia is obvious. He repeatedly asks if our reporter is a police officer and then says we should step outside his home and speak instead in the middle of the rice paddy he keeps nearby. As he forms a path through the knee-high plants, he starts to talk. ""What happened was like a nightmare to me,"" he says.Over the following days, he gives one of his first detailed interviews since that theft, an act that led to the death of at least three people, and possibly many more. Even after all this time, he is still afraid he too could be killed for what he did. It's a feeling that has remained with him from the moment he was caught.""At that time after I was arrested, I felt like I was out of my mind,"" he says. ""I was panicking and paranoid all the time because of everything around me. The only thing on my mind was that I wouldn't make it out alive. I also thought there were many people who wanted to make me disappear or to kill me. I couldn't sleep at all for a week.""Kriangkrai insists he had no idea the crime he committed would turn out to be as significant as it did. He knew the gold was worth a lot of money, he says, but didn't appreciate the full value of the other items until after he had left prison. ""When the police found me,"" he says, ""I chose not to fight. I surrendered. I also returned the jewels and helped get back the items I sold. But if it wasn't for the involvement of powerful people in Thailand, this story wouldn't be so big.""As soon as he left prison - a five-year sentence reduced to only two years and seven months after he pleaded guilty - Kriangkrai changed his surname, to avoid bringing embarrassment to his son.But he continued to feel guilty for what he did, and said his life after prison was full of ""disappointment and unfortunate events"". And so, in March 2016, he decided to become ordained as a Buddhist monk.Kriangkrai invited the media to his ordination ceremony, and said only a few words. ""I want to be ordained for life to erase the curse of the Saudi diamond,"" he said, ""and to dedicate my merit to the people ensnared by my karma, and those who died in all these past events. I want everyone's forgiveness for what I've done.""Kriangkrai chose a name for himself as a monk that translated as ""he who is as strong as a diamond"".Among those present that day was Chalor Kerdthes, the police chief who had been jailed for his role in the killings of the gem dealer's family. While in prison, Thai media reported, he had continued to state he was not guilty, and had developed a skill as an Elvis impersonator. After his release, he too had decided to become a monk, but his time in the monastery did not last long.Chalor Kerdthes and Kriangkrai are the only people to have been jailed over the Blue Diamond Affair, as it is now known. In March, Thailand's Supreme Court cleared five former police officers over the disappearance and killing of the Saudi businessman, Mohammad al-Ruwaili.While in the monastery, Kriangkrai still could not shake his past. People would seek him out and ask where he had hidden the blue diamond. He would tell them nothing, which led them to believe he had hidden it at home. The blue diamond has never been found.Kriangkrai stayed in the monastery for only three years. ""I couldn't be a monk for life since I still have my family that needs me,"" he says. Now aged 61, he takes whatever work he can find to survive - farming, tending rice paddies, maintenance. ""Now I live a simple life as a country man,"" Kriangkrai says inside his wooden home. ""I don't have much money. It's only enough to survive and feed my family. I guess that for me is true happiness."""

309,Giant panda death in Thailand leaves China asking questions,"A popular giant panda has died unexpectedly in a Thai zoo - prompting China to send experts to investigate. Chuang Chuang had been at the Chiang Mai zoo on loan from China since 2003. The 19-year old bear was widely popular across Thailand, especially due to repeated efforts by the zoo to get him to mate with his female companion. His unexplained death on Monday caused uproar on Chinese social media, with many users accusing Thailand of not caring properly for the animal. Giant pandas, which are native to China, usually live for 25 to 30 years in captivity. They were regarded as endangered, but were reclassified as ""vulnerable"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, following an increase in numbers.China loans the animals to countries around the world as a way of strengthening diplomatic ties. There's extensive reporting in China about the animals' lives overseas, and Chuang Chuang's early death has received widespread coverage in state media.According to Chinese news agency Xinhua, an investigation will be carried out to establish the cause of death, and experts from the China Conservation and Research Centre will travel to Chiang Mai to work with their Thai counterparts. Some social media users on China's Twitter-like platform Weibo were concerned, saying: ""Thailand is not suitable for raising pandas"", and ""they don't treat animals as well as we think"". Others asked for the remaining female panda in Chiang Mai, Lin Hui, to be returned to China.

""In response to his insults in the CNN interview, I meant to insult him back by expressing my opinion that he seemed like a creepy old man.""Mr Musk also said in his court filings that his aide hired a private investigator who ""reported that Mr Unsworth associated with Europeans who engage in improper sexual conduct in Thailand"".Mr Unsworth, who lives partly in Thailand with his 41-year-old partner, has denied all accusations of wrongdoing.His lawyer Lin Wood told the AFP news agency: ""Musk's motion is as offensive to the truth and the sworn testimony developed in this case as was his initial false and heinous accusation of paedophilia.""The defamation trial is scheduled for 2 December.Mr Musk's comments on Twitter have been controversial on other occasions.In April he reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over his tweets, which also puts a restriction on his use of Twitter."
311,Thailand Tiger Temple: More than half have died since rescue,"More than half of the 147 tigers that were rescued from a controversial Thai Buddhist temple just three years ago have died, officials have said.A total of 86 tigers have died since they were moved from the Wat Pha Luang Ta Bua temple, a tourist attraction known as Tiger Temple, in 2016.Thailand's park service said many had died of a virus, having been weakened by the stress of relocation.Officials also blamed genetic problems linked to inbreeding among the group.Thai Tiger Temple's long history of controversyBut conservationists have questioned whether authorities were holding the tigers in safe conditions.The temple's monks, meanwhile, have denied accusations of animal abuse, trafficking and illegal breeding while the tigers were under their care.The temple has been closed to the public since 2016.Since police raids in 2016, the tigers have been held at two breeding stations in nearby Ratchaburi province as it is believed they would have little chance of survival in the wild.But only 61 of the original 147 have survived in captivity. Thai authorities said some fell ill with Canine Distemper Virus or CDV. Many had difficulty breathing or eating, and died as a result.Speaking with Reuters news agency, temple caretaker Athithat Srimanee denied the accusations that the tigers died because of inbreeding. He said the government was playing a ""blame game"". Edwin Wiek, founder of the Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand (WFFT), told the BBC that the big cats were being kept in small, cramped cages, making it easy for disease to spread.He added that Canine Distemper is treatable with proper food and supplements, access to clean water, and enough space to move around. But a limited government budget made this impossible.""To be very honest, who would be ready to take in so many tigers at once?"" said Mr Wiek. ""The authorities should have asked for help from outside, but instead insisted on doing all work themselves.""Analysis by Jonathan Head, BBC South-East Asia correspondentThe deaths of so many tigers in two government facilities has refocused attention on the challenges of managing an ever-expanding population of captive tigers, not just in Thailand, but in neighbouring countries like Laos and China. Despite pledges by both Thailand and Laos to reduce the numbers of tigers held in captivity on so-called ""tiger farms"", the populations have continued to rise. There are now around 2,000 captive tigers in Thailand. Many are held by private individuals, not state institutions. Captive tigers are a lucrative business, popular in particular with Chinese tourists who now make up nearly one third of foreign visitors in Thailand. They breed easily, and there is always a suspicion that some are diverted into the illegal trade in tiger parts, which then encourages the poaching of South East Asia's dwindling population of wild tigers. Wildlife campaigners say state institutions in Thailand need better funding to start taking custody of these privately owned tigers, and the tiger industry should be regulated more strictly.The attraction, run by Buddhist monks, was located in Thailand's Kanchanaburi Province, west of Bangkok.At its height, visitors were charged 600 Thai Baht ($16, £11) for entry, with additional costs to pet, feed, or take pictures with the tigers.A National Geographic report alleged that the monks were operating a for-profit breeding business.The WFFT also alleged there was evidence that wildlife trafficking took place, but has not provided specific examples.In December 2014, authorities were alerted after three adult male tigers vanished from the temple. They had been micro-chipped, a legal requirement for captive endangered animals in Thailand, which allows them to be tracked.The temple's veterinarian Somchai Visasmongkolchai later came forward after resigning from his post and said the microchips had been cut out of the three males.When police raided the site in 2016, 40 dead tiger cubs were found in the temple's kitchen freezer, along with other animal body parts."

His body was found in woodland on 17 January.Mr Wood, of Crediton, Devon, was last seen on CCTV leaving his beachside hotel on the evening of 30 December.Exeter coroner Philip Spinney recorded an open conclusion, saying the evidence ""does not fully explain"" the death.""[The evidence] does not point to third-party involvement or that he took his own life"" Mr Spinney said.""I expect that day he went out and got lost in the woodland. He could not get out and died in the woods.""Mr Wood, who was staying at the Dream Boutique Hotel in Petcharburi, was described as a heavy drinker who suffered with work stress and anxiety.He had flown to Thailand to spend Christmas with his father, while his wife Jenny stayed at home to take care of their two children.Mrs Wood acknowledged her husband ""enjoyed a pint"", but said he had sought help for his drinking and had been prescribed Valium for his anxiety.""I do not believe for one minute that he would do anything to himself,"" she added.Thai police said money and personal possessions were found with Mr Wood's body, ruling out foul play because of a lack of injuries.A post-mortem examination conducted in the UK failed to determine the cause of death.Pathologist Dr Amanda Jeffery said alcohol consumption combined with Mr Wood's medication could have led to his death, but the condition of his body meant it was impossible to confirm."
317,TM30: The form getting expats in Thailand into a bureaucratic tangle,"Thailand has long been an attractive destination for Western expats - where money goes further and can buy a good quality of life. But the revival of an arcane immigration law has angered the expat community and got them questioning their freedoms in Thailand, as George Styllis reports from Bangkok.""I've been made to feel as if I'm not welcome here,"" says Zareeka Gardner, a 25-year-old English teacher from the US.She is one of the many foreigners living in Thailand who has ended up having to pay a fine because her apartment manager failed to promptly file a form saying where she was staying. Thailand's Immigration Act contains a clause requiring all foreigners to let the authorities know where they're staying at all times. Previously this job has been done by hotels collecting guests' details, or it was just ignored. But as of March, the government has been applying the law without compromise or exception. Landlords must notify immigration authorities whenever a foreigner returns home after spending more than 24 hours away from their permanent residence -  be it a trip abroad or even leaving the province. The same applies to foreigners married to Thais - their Thai spouse, if they own the house, must file the report.The form, known as a TM30, must be submitted within 24 hours of the foreigner's arrival or the property owner will be fined. If the fine for not doing so isn't paid - between 800 baht ($26; £21) and 2,000 baht - the foreigner will be unable to renew their visa or other permits. So they often, like Zareeka, end up paying themselves. The process has provoked confusion and consternation across Thailand, prompting caustic cartoons from local newspapers and outrage on social media.Many have complained of inconsistencies between provincial authorities, and of landlords failing or refusing to fulfil their responsibilities, leaving tenants to pay the fine or risk losing their right to stay in Thailand.There is an app and a website for the form, but many users have complained of trouble getting access or technical glitches. So they have to visit immigration offices, which can be an all-day affair with confusing forms.  Sebastian Brousseau, CEO of Isaan Lawyers in Nakhon Ratchasima province says he was inundated with questions after the law started being applied. He says the law is regressive. ""I have clients that were in Thailand before, that are leaving Thailand because they feel unwelcome,"" he says. Foreigners residing in Thailand must already report to immigration every 90 days, an order known as TM47. Only those with permanent residency or a special visa are exempt from this and other orders.""Already they felt it was a burden to fill in the TM47 and now with the TM30, for them, it's too much,"" said Brousseau.He has now launched an online petition calling on the government to scrap the law. The petition has gathered nearly 6,000 signatures. It's not just foreigners who are finding the mounting bureaucracy bothersome.Suchada Phoisaat, a journalist and entrepreneur, lost a day's work doing the TM30 on her Russian husband's behalf at the immigration department.""There were long queues - it was annoying. If foreigners or Thais have to do this, we just ask for a proper system to help us save time.""The immigration law was introduced in 1979, when Thailand was trying to keep track of an influx of Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees fleeing conflicts at home. Just why the government is enforcing the law now remains unclear since official reasons are flimsy. Still haunted by the major terrorist attack in Bangkok of 2015, the government says it will help strengthen national security while protecting law-abiding foreigners. ""Good guys in, Bad guys out,"" is its slogan. Yet by responding to criticism with ways to shortcut the registration process, the government has often undermined its own argument, along with that of it forcing rogue landlords to declare their earnings. Such holes have left foreigners cynical.Zareeka Gardner says she feels defeated by the system.Coming from the bureaucracy of China, she felt Thailand would be an easier place to live. But lost in a thicket of vague and contradictory information, without help from her teaching agency, her perception soon changed.Still without a work permit and hounded about it daily by officials, she has had enough and booked a flight back to China. During one immigration visit on another issue, she says, an official told her he would send police to visit every day ""until you are gone"".""I went out and just cried for about half an hour,"" she says, adding that she knows people who have gone through worse than she has.The growing number of cases like Zareeka's comes at a worrying time for businesses heavily dependent on foreign labour and money. While international tourism should be relatively immune to the immigration law, domestic travel among foreigners is expected to dip.The economy is already struggling, growing at its slowest rate in nearly five years in the second quarter, and aspirations for it to go digital will not be met with punitive immigration policies, says Amarit Charoenphan, co-founder of HUBBA, a co-working space and community.Yet the government remains defiant, maintaining the law is necessary.Speaking at a panel discussion last week at Thailand's Foreign Correspondents' Club, representatives of the immigration department conceded there had been technical problems with filling the TM30 forms online, but once addressed, the process should run smoothly.But for foreigners like Zareeka, they're wondering if it's worth waiting.""Sure, it's nice here, but with all the hoops we have to go through, is it really worth it?"" she said.George Styllis is a freelance journalist based in Bangkok "
318,Thai beach murders: Death sentence upheld by Supreme Court,"Two men convicted of murdering two British backpackers in Thailand have had their death sentence upheld by its Supreme Court.The bodies of Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, were found on a beach on Koh Tao in September 2014.Burmese bar workers Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Tun were found guilty of murder in 2015. They lost an appeal in 2017.The men claimed they were tortured by police and their legal team had argued evidence had been mishandledMiss Witheridge, a University of Essex student from Hemsby, Norfolk and Mr Miller, a civil and structural engineering graduate, from Jersey had been bludgeoned to death.A post-mortem examination showed Miss Witheridge had been raped.The mothers of  Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Tun lodged appeals at Koh Samui court in May 2016 over concerns about the judgements, in particular the DNA evidence used in the investigation.The case was upheld and taken to the Thailand Supreme Court - the country's final court of appeal. Defence lawyers argued DNA from a garden hoe - allegedly used as the murder weapon - did not match samples taken from the men.They also claimed evidence had been mishandled by police and the pair's confessions were the result of ""systematic abuse"" of migrants in the area.""The collection, transporting, testing, analysis, reporting and storage of forensics or DNA evidence used in the Koh Tao murder case didn't comply with international standards,"" said Andy Hall, one of the families' legal advisors.Prosecutors said DNA evidence collected from cigarette butts, a condom and the bodies of the victims linked Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Tun to the deaths.The men, from Myanmar, retracted their initial confessions to the offences, saying they had been tortured by police."
319,Island mystery: 'How did my son die in Thailand?',"Police in Thailand are being urged to investigate the unexplained death of a Scottish engineer in his own home.The body of David Cornock, 37, was discovered by his wife, Grecelle, in their bungalow in Koh Samui on 2 May.But it was eight days before a post mortem was held by which time the cause of death could not be established due to decomposition.The Foreign Office has raised the case with both the Thai Police and Interpol.David's father has also enlisted the help former detective David Swindle, co-founder of Justice Abroad.Mr Cornock, of Montrose, told BBC Scotland: ""As a family we have been left in the dark and David's death remains undetermined.""We have no visibility of the circumstances surrounding David's passing and have many concerns with regards to this.""We will never see our beloved son again and we never got the opportunity to say goodbye.""It is our duty to seek truth, clarity and justice.""The engineering account manager last heard from David on Sunday 28 April. Mr Cornock, 59, recalled a typical long distance phone call in which they discussed football and roast dinners as his son prepared to meet up with some friends.The following day he received a text message from David - who has a son and stepdaughter in Brazil - with some advice about buying a motorbike. It was the last contact between them.At 11:00 on Thursday 2 May Mr Cornock's wife, Margaret, called him during a meeting in Aberdeen.""I was completely shocked and bewildered,"" he said.""I told the man I was with 'My son has just died' and he grabbed me. I don't remember the journey home. Looking back now it's like a dream.""I still think David is going to walk in the house or give me a call.""  When David's body was repatriated on 17 May, Mr Cornock was contacted by an official who had reviewed the death certificate.It stated: ""Could not determine the cause of death due to decomposition changes in body.""The family were asked if they wanted a second post mortem but, anxious to avoid further delay, opted to proceed with the funeral.  David's requiem mass was held in Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire, on 31 May and afterwards he was cremated.For the last three months the family have been anxiously seeking answers as to how David died.They are also striving to establish what, if anything, local officers did at the scene to collect and preserve evidence. But, to date, they have had no formal response from the Royal Thai Police.The only paperwork they have managed to obtain is a post mortem report which confirms a major delay between the discovery of David's body and the examination. The document, which they had to translate, concluded the cause of death could not be determined due to the decomposition of vital organs.Mr Cornock said: ""David was a devoted father, son and friend to many.""He was a global traveller, entrepreneur, generous to a fault, trusting, loved a laugh and had a great sense of humour. ""We are broken by his loss.""His wife Margaret added: ""I wouldn't like any other parent to go through what we are going through - sitting here, not having answers.""David was brought up in Renton, West Dunbartonshire, and emigrated to Brisbane in Australia with his father, stepmother and stepsister in 1996.He joined the Australian Navy and trained as an avionics engineer. When the family returned to Scotland in 2006 David worked in the offshore industry as a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) engineer.The job took him all over the world, including stints in Australia, China and Brazil where he met his first wife, Ana Paula. She already had a daughter, Paola, and they had a son, David Luiz, in 2012.The family were living in Thailand when the couple split in 2015 but David continued to support them financially when they returned to Brazil.While on business in the US he met American national Grecelle Rivera and they married in Florida in July 2017.The Justice Abroad team are reviewing all available case related material on behalf of the family to support investigations conducted by the authorities on Koh Samui.Mr Swindle said: ""Surely there must have been investigations conducted at the time which can provide more information?""Despite numerous requests for further information about the Thai Police investigation no case related documentation has been made available to David's family which is a shocking lack of transparency and terrible way to treat someone losing a loved one in such tragic circumstances.""The investigator who has worked with the families of Kirsty Maxwell and Craig Mallon, said families who lose loved ones abroad in unexplained circumstances abroad are often ""abandoned"".He added: ""David's family continue to be in dialogue with their elected member and the FCO to attempt to obtain the case related documentation which I sincerely hope will assist them understand what happened to David and the extent of police investigations carried out.""Police Scotland have no powers to investigate the circumstances as David was not ordinarily resident in Scotland.The family's MP Kirstene Hair, Conservative member for Angus, has written to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and Scottish Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf to request an update on the case A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""Our staff continue to provide support to the family of a British man following his death in Thailand and liaise with the Thai authorities"".The Royal Thai Police did not respond to BBC Scotland's request for a comment."

329,Achieving the impossible: Thai cave rescue a year on,"For a moment, Vernon Unsworth almost cries. He stops talking, his eyes redden, he takes a deep breath, and reaches for his cup of tea.Even now, a year after one of the most complex and dangerous rescues the world has ever seen, Vernon is still dealing with the trauma of those 17 desperate days.The memory of the moment he heard 12 boys and their football coach had been found alive deep underground is almost too much. The relief - and the horror of what lay ahead - come flooding back. ""The real problems started from then,"" he told the BBC Beyond Today podcast.""We knew where they were. It's a kilometre and a half of diving. How the hell were we going to get them out alive?""Vernon is a calm, measured man who deals well with pressure. He's been exploring underground caves for almost 50 years – a hobby that started in his native Lancashire when he was 16. ""The bug is finding a passage nobody's ever been into before - you know you're the first. Whatever footprints you leave, they're yours."" It's a hobby - not his job. But it's a pastime that made him one of just a handful of people in the world who could even attempt the impossible: saving the Wild Boars football team.Who are the Thai boys who were trapped in a cave?What to do to survive undergroundThe Wild Boars were a group of 12 boys aged 11 to 16. On Saturday 23 June 2018, after their football training, they decided to head to the Tham Luang caves for a day trip, along with their 25-year-old coach. It's a well-known local landmark and it wasn't unusual to go in at that time of year. Many like to see how far they can get into a system that runs for 10km (six miles). Some of the boys had been before. This time, they decided they would all go in together.But the team got trapped by floodwater 4km (2.5 miles) inside – and that's when Thai officials called Vernon's phone, asking him to help out. ""I know it [the cave system] better than anybody. It's been my second home. I don't have to think about where I am,"" he says.He drove to Tham Luang to meet officials and the local rescue team, but was stunned with what he found.""[It was] organised chaos,"" he said.Thai cave boys sign Netflix deal""They didn't really know what to do, simply because they'd never had this situation arise before – especially involving 13 people trapped by rising floodwaters. But I knew because of the weather conditions that it was only going to get worse.""I knew that this was going to end with someone losing their life.""Vernon took matters into his own hands. He wrote a list of the team he believed he needed for the rescue. It included Rob Harper, Rick Stanton, and John Volanthen - who were all in the UK. In an attempt to get the Britons involved, Vernon spoke to the former governor of the local province, Chiang Rai, a man named Narongsak Osatanakorn.""I got him into a room and I basically said to him: Sir, you have one chance at this rescue."" To put the pressure on, Vernon met other government officials too. That evening Rob, Rick and John were on a plane to Thailand.It was straight to work for the British divers.On 28 June, in appalling weather conditions, John Volanthen and Rick Stanton went to the cave for an exploratory dive. To their disbelief, they found four Thai water management officials who had been trapped in there overnight.""Officials tried to basically ignore it ever happened because they didn't know the guys were in there. There was no logging of people going in. Nobody reported them as being lost or not around, not even their wives.""Governor Narongsak disputes this - he says he and other officials did know the four water officials were in the cave, and they had been told not to evacuate.But the unexpected rescue was a blessing in disguise.John and Rick had to dive the four officials out of the flooded caves. One of them had panicked during the rescue – and now Vernon and the team knew it would be impossible - if they were to find the boys - to dive them out of the cave without sedation.The search for the team started on 1 July, but it wasn't until the following day that they were discovered. Rick and John led the way. ""There was a horrible smell,"" Vernon remembers Rick telling him. ""Rick thought it was dead bodies. It was faeces. They thought they were finding bodies."" They'd found the team - but now they had to get them out.To the divers' knowledge, there are only three people in the world who are both elite cave divers and anaesthetists – one in the UK, one in the US, and one in Australia.The British team got in touch with the Australian, Richard ""Harry"" Harris.""Doc Harry said: 'It won't work'. He said 'it just won't work',"" Vernon recalls.""Rick said to Harry: 'Well I'd like you to sleep on it overnight', and Harry said to Rick: 'What if I decide not to do it?'"" ""And Rick said: 'They all die'.""Richard Harris was almost on board. First, though, he made sure that the Australian government negotiated with the Thai government to give him immunity in case anything went wrong. For the others, British embassy officials were brought to Tham Luang to make sure they were also protected. And a plan was put together. The only way they might get the boys out alive was to sedate them. They used a mixture of ketamine, xanax, and atropine to try to dry up fluids so they wouldn't choke on their own saliva. The Wild Boars were knocked out. In some cases, they were barely breathing. Each boy was given a full face mask, then packaged up - strapped to a kind of stretcher, tied hand and foot with cable ties. The team set up a system of relays which the divers took them through - sometimes holding them close to their bodies, sometimes pushing them ahead, round the twisting s-bends of the caves. They even rigged up a pulley system on the roof of the cave and pulled them along. Vernon remembers that two of the boys started to wake up during the rescue. ""They were given a quick jab to get them unconscious (again)."" One by one, the boys were brought out. ""For us, it was a situation where four had miraculously come out alive, but we had to stay grounded - because it didn't mean that the next nine were going to come out alive,"" he says.By the end of day two, eight of the boys were out. Four boys and their coach were still trapped. And the conditions were getting worse. ""The rain that was forecast actually came earlier than we expected. It was 50/50 whether the dive went ahead on that morning.""But it did, just.""One of the divers lost his dive line whilst carrying one of the precious packages, but he made it out as well. ""And literally, after the last boy was on his way out of the cave, the floodwaters just suddenly started to come through.""What was meant to be was meant to be,"" says Vernon.In Thailand, superstition and belief in mystical powers is prevalent. Lots of places across the country are said to have various powers, especially caves.Tham Luang is associated with the myth of Nang Non, a princess who ran off with a lover and ended up taking her own life. She was supposedly pregnant with his child. The rivers inside the cave system are believed to be her blood. Today, a year on, Tham Luang has become a tourist attraction. Many Thais stop and briefly pay their respects at the shrine there - only now it is not just to the princess, but to Saman Gunan, the one person who died. He was a Thai diver who lost his life while delivering oxygen tanks just before they started the rescue effort. A statue of Saman was unveiled outside the cave complex six months after the rescue, to commemorate him. As for Vernon, he still spends a lot of his time in the area. He's been back inside the caves several times since the rescue. For him, something has changed. ""Now before I go into the cave and when I come out I have a little prayer. I give her some flowers every time I go in now and when I come out I thank her for keeping me safe, which I've never ever done before. But it's just how I feel about the whole thing.""None of us are heroes. We've just done a job that we were asked to do and we did it to the best of what we were able to do. ""It wasn't always easy but 13 isn't an unlucky number any more, is it?""This episode of the Beyond Today podcast is available here."

331,Italian George Clooney fraudsters arrested in Thailand,"An Italian man accused of posing as George Clooney to promote a clothing label has been arrested with his wife in Thailand after years on the run.Francesco Galdelli, 58, and Vanja Goffi, 45, had been wanted on an Interpol red notice since 2013.The US actor sued them, and in a 2010 trial in Italy testified against them, saying they had fraudulently used his name to advertise a fashion business.They are also accused of a series of other scams and frauds in Italy. The couple fled their home country to avoid arrest and had been dubbed the Italian Bonnie and Clyde after the notorious US bank robbers.They sustained their life in Thailand with an online scheme selling fake Rolex watches, reportedly posting some buyers small packets of salt instead of the expensive timepieces. Police said the couple would be charged for overstaying their visas before any extradition proceedings took place.The two were arrested on Saturday in a joint operation of Thai and Italian authorities on the outskirts of the Thai city of Pattaya, Thailand's Crime Suppression Division said on Sunday. Police surrounded a luxury villa, where the pair had taken refuge after they were located in a surveillance operation involving a drone, before breaking in and detaining them. ""During interrogation, Francesco confessed to claiming to be George Clooney and opening a clothes business to trick people into sending money,"" AFP news agency reported, citing Thai police. The pair had been living in Thailand since 2014, authorities said. Mr Galdelli was arrested that same year, but escaped custody during his trial.A subsequent investigation, made at the request of Italy, found that Mr Galdelli had paid prison guards 20,000 Thai baht (€570, £500) before slipping away, according to Italian media.The couple, who have been described in Italy as ""expert scammers"", launched a clothing line called GC and specialised in private sales to individuals, purporting to have Mr Clooney's endorsement - even displaying his signature. The pair were later accused of using doctored photographs of themselves with the famous Hollywood actor at a number of events to promote their products. During his court appearance in Milan in 2010, Mr Clooney said the couple had forged his signature and that he wanted to testify ""because I believe in the judicial system"". As part of his 90-minute testimony, he said he did not endorse the couple's fashion business and that it was not him in the pictures shown. ""I don't smoke, I don't have this watch and I don't wear those pin-up pants,"" he said. ""These people are using my name, not to cheat me, but [to cheat] other people,"" Mr Clooney is quoted as saying in a 2011 report in Italian newspaper La Repubblica (in Italian). "

How much is it worth? A wealthy Thai food lover appears to have answered that question last Saturday.The thorny durian is a delicacy in much of Asia but also controversial - you either love it or hate it.Its potent stench means it's banned from public transportation, hotels and planes in certain countries.According to media reports, the luxury fruit sold at the King of Durian festival in Thailand had been picked just a day before at a local farm. While even a regular durian of good quality can cost you between $50 and $100, the staggering sum paid last weekend was about double the previous record price at the auction, organisers told the media.In other recent durian news:A whole plane had to be grounded in Indonesia over passengers' complaints about a load of the fruit stored in the holdStudents and teachers in Australia were evacuated from a university over the unexplained smell from a rotting durian, which was thought to be gasEarlier this year, a man in China failed a breathalyser test after eating too much of the special fruit "

The opposition Pheu Thai party, linked to ousted former PM Thaksin Shinawatra, won the most seats in the lower house but the upper house was appointed by the military government. Hence the combined vote of both houses saw Mr Prayuth elected, despite his not having a majority in the lower house.

336,Thailand's influential ex-PM Prem Tinsulanonda dies at 98,"Thailand's former prime minister and royal confidante Prem Tinsulanonda, one of the most influential figures in modern Thai politics, has died aged 98.The former army general, who served as prime minister from 1980 to 1988, died in a Bangkok hospital on Sunday.The most trusted advisor of late King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Prem helped to cement the military-monarchy bond. He is widely believed to have been instrumental in the 2006 coup against then Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Thailand: What you need to knowHow King Bhumibol shaped modern Thailand The sacred water that makes a kingInterim House Speaker Chai Chidchob called on Thailand's parliament to ""stand for a moment in memorial"" on Sunday morning.Aides of the influential politician said his death was caused by heart failure, according to local media reports.Prem was born in southern Thailand in 1920, 12 years before absolute monarchy was abolished.He graduated from the country's top military academy and went on to serve as army chief before moving into politics. In 1980, he became Thailand's 16th prime minister and held the position for eight years.Prem was a confidante of the late King Bhumibol and worked as president of the powerful Privy Council of royal advisors for more than two decades.Following the king's death in October 2016, he briefly served as the country's regent. His influence continued to be felt up until his death, as he played a key role in the wedding and coronation of King Maha Vajiralongkorn earlier this month.Observers say the former commander had unparalleled influence over Thailand's royalist military, which has staged 13 coups since 1932. He is believed to have played a key role in the 2006 coup that ousted Mr Thaksin.In more recent years, he spoke publicly in favour of Prayuth Chan-ocha, who led a second coup against a pro-Thaksin government in 2014. His death comes as Thailand prepares to form a new government following  the first elections since the coup five years ago. ""He will be remembered as an ardent royalist who helped to cement the monarchy's place at the very top of modern Thailand's power structure,"" said the BBC's South-East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head.

Declaring his love for freedom and democracy, he told fellow activists to ""fight with love rather than revenge"".He was one of more than 2,600 people to share the online profile published two days after the new king ascended the throne in December 2016. An opponent of the military-backed government who has taken part in numerous protests, he was the only person to be prosecuted over the article.After initially contesting the charges, Mr Jatupat eventually agreed to plead guilty. Pleading guilty in lese-majeste cases can significantly reduce sentences in Thailand, where punishment can be severe.While the United Nations has repeatedly called on Thailand to amend the law, the government says it is necessary to protect the monarchy which is widely revered across the country.Mr Jatupat's release comes amid fears for three missing Thai activists who, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW), have previously been accused by authorities of insulting the monarchy. Siam Theerawut, Kritsana Thapthai and Chucheep Chiwasut were reportedly arrested in Vietnam earlier this year.HRW says it is believed they were handed over to Thai authorities on 8 May but Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister, Prawit Wongsuwan, denied this.""Vietnam has not co-ordinated transfers. We have not received any request. If there is, it would be through the foreign ministry and police,"" he told reporters.In December, the bodies of two aides to a prominent opponent of the Thai monarchy were found in the Mekong River in north-eastern Thailand.The pair were members of a group which fled into exile in Laos in 2014 after Thailand's military coup. Thai officials denied any involvement but the incident was seen by activists as a warning not to question the status of the monarchy. Since the coup, human rights groups have accused the military of using the country's strict lese-majeste laws and other legislation to silence critics.In 2016, Maha Vajiralongkorn became Thailand's new king after the death of his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej.Last weekend, King Maha Vajiralongkorn was crowned in an elaborate ceremony lasting several days.

The vote count was marred by complaints of delays and irregularities. Who is Thailand's King Vajiralongkorn?The sacred water that makes a kingViewpoint: Thai coronation brings unpredictabilityThe military has been criticised for taking steps to ensure it would remain influential, including changing the constitution in 2017. Thailand has been buffeted by political instability for years, largely a battle between supporters of the military and ousted former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.No party won a majority in the 500-seat lower house, the country's Election Commission (EC) said after the vote on 24 March.The Election Commission confirmed this week that the opposition Pheu Thai party, which is linked to Mr Thaksin, had won the most seats in the lower house - 136, compared to the pro-military Palang Pracha Rath (PPRP)'s 115.However, Thailand's 250-seat upper house is chosen by the military and is likely to back the pro-military party.Current Prime Minister General Prayuth Chan-ocha is the candidate fielded by the PPRP and so is likely to remain in his job. It is expected that the lower and upper houses will vote together for the next prime minister within a few weeks.By Jonathan Head, BBC News, South East Asia correspondentIt has been more than six weeks since Thais voted in an election which was supposed to return the country to civilian rule. Early results showed a clear divide between those backing continued rule by the coup-makers and their supporters, and those demanding an end to military involvement in politics. But it has taken the much-criticised Election Commission (EC) this long to finalise the results, in particular 150 seats allocated proportionally. A guide to Thailand's post-coup electionVoting in Thailand's hybrid democracyThe method it used is controversial; it has given seats to some very small parties, one with fewer than 34,000 votes nationwide, thus denying earlier opposition hopes that their alliance would hold a majority. A series of dubious lawsuits have also been filed against Future Forward, a new opposition party that performed unexpectedly well. Everyone now expects coup-leader General Prayuth Chan-ocha to try to form a government in a coalition of 20 parties. But he may be strongly opposed by those who believe the entire election system unfairly favoured him, and such an unwieldy coalition may not last long.The EC has been accused of releasing delayed and inconsistent results. It abruptly stopped publishing numbers after the vote took place, blamed the media when its own data was suspect, and then said its servers had suffered from unspecified hacking attacks.The election has also been referred to as riddled with ""irregularities"", according to former leader Mr Thaksin, who said it made the country ""lose its credibility"".On Wednesday the opposition Pheu Thai party said it would ""pursue every legal means"" to challenge Thailand's seat-allocating formula, which it said robbed it of a majority by favouring smaller parties.There are 750 seats in parliament but Thailand's electorate only votes for the 500 lower house seats as the members of the 250 upper house seats are appointed by the military. Of the 500 seats, 350 are elected using a first-past-the-post system, and the remaining 150 MPs are allocated according to the proportional formula.There has been a lot of confusion over the formula, with critics saying it is designed to hurt bigger parties and help smaller outfits.

344,Viewpoint: Thai coronation heralds an unpredictable reign,"After the 70-year reign of a revered and widely-loved king, Thailand's transition to the new era of his son, Maha Vajiralongkorn, was always going to be an uneasy one, an analyst reports from London.No-one knew what to expect when King Vajiralongkorn took the throne in one of the world's most powerful monarchies at the end of 2016.The new king's controversial lifestyle and mercurial personality, and his lack of interest in the development projects so proudly promoted by his father, gave him a more remote and forbidding public image. Two-and-a-half years later, an elaborate coronation has formally consecrated King Vajiralongkorn's reign. What have these 30 months told us about the new king? The severe restrictions on open discussion of the monarchy, and the deep-rooted fear of doing so in Thailand, make it difficult to penetrate the veil of secrecy that surrounds the royal institution. But this king has already made his mark, with actions that contrast sharply with those of his father.Profile: Thailand's King VajiralongkornThe sacred water that makes a kingThailand's lese-majeste law explained As he did before he acceded to the throne, he spends much of his time in a large villa in southern Germany, where his 14-year-old son by his third marriage, Dipangkorn, is being educated. Those close to him say he prefers the less formal lifestyle he can lead there.But he has started reshaping the monarchy, restructuring the palace bureaucracy and security apparatus to put them more firmly under his control, and dismissing staff who displease him with unusually blunt public statements, sometimes condemning them as lazy, or accusing them of ""extremely evil acts"".  Some of these officials have been publicly humiliated and faced criminal charges. Jumpol Manmai, a former senior police officer and once one of the king's top advisers, was arrested and charged two years ago. There are persistent reports, impossible to confirm, of harsh punishment routines imposed on those who do not meet the king's exacting standards.King Vajiralongkorn was trained as a military officer and pilot and takes a keen interest in the armed forces, the main power brokers through much of Thai history. He has a personal royal guard of at least 5,000 well-equipped and well-trained soldiers, and has presided over changes to troop deployments in Bangkok which appear to put more army units under his command, and shift others out of the capital. Soldiers and police must keep their hair extremely short and on parade they must execute a difficult new salute, which involves puffing up the chest and jerking the head quickly to one side. Under King Vajiralongkorn the much-criticised lese majeste law is no longer being used against perceived insults to the monarchy. But other repressive laws, like the sedition law and the computer crimes act, are being used against those judged too critical of either the military or the monarchy, and can carry long prison sentences. Other causes for unease have been the mysterious removal of two monuments in Bangkok marking the end of the absolute monarchy after 1932, and the disappearance of five republican activists living in exile in neighbouring Laos, two of whose bodies were found, cut open, in the Mekong River. There is no evidence linking these incidents to either the palace or the military government, but they are being seen by dissidents in Thailand as a warning not to question the status of the monarchy.The king has taken direct personal control of the crown's vast assets, valued at well over $30bn (£23bn), and which under his father were always described as being held in trust for the nation, not the king.He has installed his closest adviser, retired Air Chief Marshall Satitpong Sukvimol, who has served King Vajiralongkorn for 14 years, to run the Crown Property Bureau, and put army chief General Apirat Kongsompong onto the board as well. But some assets have been sold, notably a controlling stake in the international Kempinski Hotel Group, thought to be worth around $1bn. The king is also reported to have taken more direct control of significant shareholdings in the two most important royal companies.What he plans to do with these substantial funds is not yet clear. King Vajiralongkorn has also reclaimed royal properties in the old historic quarter of Bangkok which had been the site of important public institutions, like the city's oldest and largest zoo and the national parliament, which now have to move. Again, it is unclear what his plans are for these strategic parcels of land.Officially the monarchy is enshrined in a position above politics. In practice, its influence has often been significant, sometimes decisive. King Vajiralongkorn showed a willingness to intervene in areas that mattered to him early on, throwing the military government into confusion when, on the death of his father in 2016, he refused to take the throne for six weeks. He insisted on changes to the new constitution brought in by the military government in areas defining royal powers.But his most dramatic intervention was in February this year, when he issued a royal command effectively forbidding his older sister from running as the prime ministerial candidate for a political party backed by the exiled former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Mr Thaksin, whose parties had won all the elections held in the last 20 years, may have hoped the star quality and royal status of Princess Ubolrat would give his side an unassailable advantage in this year's election. That the palace intervened so late, only after she had announced her nomination, after weeks of rumours, gives weight to the claim by some in Mr Thaksin's camp that she had at least a tacit endorsement from the king, and that it took intervention by the military to change the king's mind.Princess Ubolratana: The royal upending Thai politicsThai king makes 'bodyguard' his queenThe notion of King Vajiralongkorn aligning the royal family with Thaksin Shinawatra, the nemesis of the military and conservative royalists and Thailand's most successful election campaigner, would have turned Thai politics on its head. There were rumours some years ago of a close relationship between Thaksin Shinawatra and the then crown prince. But that notion has been scotched by recent events. The party was dissolved, significantly weakening the pro-Thaksin alliance. The king followed this by publicly stripping Mr Thaksin of his royal decorations, and making an unprecedented statement on the eve of the election calling on Thais to vote for ""good people"", a phrase understood to refer to anti-Thaksin pillars of the royalist establishment.The king's relationship with the military junta which seized power five years ago is harder to assess. The generals are intensely loyal to the monarchy. The Thai armed forces and the royal institution have built a symbiotic partnership over the past 70 years of coups and Cold War conflict. Each needs the other. But King Vajiralongkorn has discomfited the current military rulers by some of his actions, and is actively promoting officers who may be seen as their future rivals. His palace has become a distinct source of power in Thailand, an opaque and unquantifiable one.The coronation was to be followed almost immediately by the announcement of the final result of the 24 March election, and the formation of a new government. Already there are clear signs that the much-criticised Election Commission, a body picked by junta-appointed lawmakers, will act in ways that weaken the representation of opposition parties in parliament. If, as predicted, the pro-military party is able to form a government, expect loud complaints from Thais unhappy about the judicial harassment of opposition parties and the contentious seat allocation system used by the commission. Few people believe the long-awaited and much-delayed restoration of an elected government will end the political polarisation of the country.After he placed the Great Crown of Victory on his head, King Vajiralongkorn stated that ""I shall continue, preserve, and build upon the royal legacy and shall reign with righteousness for the benefit and happiness of the people forever"".Thai king- Rare footage of 1926 coronationVoting in Thailand's hybrid democracyBut how will he approach the messy, post-election environment? At one time Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn was thought to be uninterested in many of the affairs of state, that he might be a hands-off monarch. His actions as king, however, have shown him to be keenly concerned with redefining royal power, and with the success of his reign. Will he continue the close partnership with a military that wants to remain at the heart of political power, or might he encourage parties promoting reform and a more liberal political climate? One quality of the new king has shone out these past 30 months - his unpredictability."

349,Thailand's King Vajiralongkorn crowned,"Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn has been crowned on the first of three days of coronation rites.King Vajiralongkorn inherited the throne in 2016 when his long-reigning father Bhumibol Adulyadej died. Days ago in a surprise announcement the palace said the king had married his long-term partner and royal consort who would now be Queen Suthida.Thailand has a constitutional monarchy, but the royal family is highly revered by Thais and wields considerable power.Thailand also has strict laws, called lese majeste, which ban criticism of the monarchy. The laws have shielded the royal family from public view and scrutiny.In pictures: Thai coronation ceremonyDuring Saturday's ceremony the 66-year-old king was handed the 7.3kg (16lbs) Great Crown of Victory, which he placed on his head.He then issued his first royal command, promising to reign with righteousness, as his father had done at his coronation 69 years ago.The coronation comes at a time of political uncertainty. A general election was held on 24 March, the first since the army took control in a coup in 2014, but a new government has yet to be declared.Coronation explained: The sacred water that makes a kingThailand's lese-majeste law explained King Vajiralongkorn is the second child, and first son, of Queen Sirikit and Bhumibol Adulyadej.He was educated in the UK and Australia and has been trained at the Royal Military College in Canberra. He went on to become an officer in the Thai armed forces and is a qualified civilian and fighter pilot. He became crown prince and official heir to the throne in 1972. He is now known as Rama X, or the 10th King of the Chakri dynasty.Queen Suthida, who is his fourth wife, is the deputy commander of his personal security unit. She was made a full general in the army in December 2016.The coronation rituals began at 10:09 (03:09 GMT), an auspicious time, when King Vajiralongkorn changed into a white robe to go through purification and anointment ceremonies using sacred water that has been collected from more than 100 locations around the country.He is receiving the five Royal Regalia - the symbols of kingship - which includes the Great Crown of Victory.Most of the main Brahmin and Buddhist rituals take place on Saturday, and the coronation continues until Monday.While King Vajiralongkorn has been on the throne since 2016, in Thai tradition he cannot be considered a divine representative on Earth nor the main patron of Buddhism until he is consecrated.On Sunday, King Vajiralongkorn will take part in a procession around the capital, Bangkok, giving people a chance to celebrate. Large crowds are expected for this event as well as when he makes a public appearance on a balcony at the Grand Palace on Monday.King Vajiralongkorn spends most of his time abroad and is not as well known to the public as his father. But huge portraits of him can now be seen at many buildings after it was made mandatory for state offices to erect them in the weeks leading up to the celebration.Civil servants were also asked to wear yellow - the colour associated with the king. Many ordinary Thais will also be wearing yellow to show their loyalty to the monarch.

350,Leeds teacher wanted sex with Filipino girls as young as four,"A former music teacher has been jailed for five years for plotting to sexually abuse young girls in the Philippines.James Alexander, 42, was caught after sending money to known facilitators who live-streamed child sexual abuse from Illigan City.Leeds Crown Court heard he asked for images of girls aged nine and six ""posing in a certain way"" and asked what the youngest ""would do with him"".He also said he wanted to have sexual relations with a four-year-old.Alexander, of Beeston Road, Beeston, Leeds, admitted arranging the commission of a child sex offence, three counts of attempting to cause a girl under 13 to engage in sexual activity, and one count of making indecent images of a child.In addition to his sentence, he was given a five-year sexual harm prevention order banning foreign travel, and was made to sign the sex offenders register for life.Alexander was arrested on 30 June 2018 at Manchester Airport as he flew into the UK from Thailand where he had lived since 2017.National Crime Agency (NCA) investigators seized his electronic devices, which showed he sent at least 15 money transfers to facilitators between August 2017 and June 2018.More stories across YorkshireAlexander - who taught in Leeds and Malaysia before moving to Thailand - also tried to arrange to travel to the Philippines to abuse girls himself, the NCA said.In one conversation, he discussed meeting young girls in a hotel and asked the facilitator: ""Are you going to bring them both with you and stay also?

352,"Thai king coronation: Sacred water, royal regalia and a housewarming party","An elaborate three-day coronation is taking place for the king of Thailand, and sacred water plays a key role in the consecration rites.The official ceremonies, a mix of Brahmin and Buddhist rituals, begin on 4 May in the capital, Bangkok.     King Maha Vajiralongkorn, 66, inherited the throne upon the death of his revered father King Bhumibol Adulyadej in 2016. But in Thai royal tradition only after a king is consecrated does he become a Devaraja, or God king, and the upholder of Buddhism.This is the first coronation in living memory for most of the Thai population and big crowds are expected to attend.""This is a significant occasion where Thai people can reassure ourselves that we have long history, rich culture and close ties between the monarchy and the people,"" says Prof Tongthong Chandransu from Chulalongkorn University - a researcher in Thai culture.Historically, Thai society was established around the banks of its rivers which provided staples like rice and fish. So many of its ceremonies and traditions revolve around water.For weeks leading up to the coronation, officials collected water from more than 100 sources across the country between 11:52 and 12:38 - deemed an auspicious time in Thai astrology.The water was then blessed in Buddhist ceremonies at major temples before being combined in another consecration rite at Wat Suthat - one of Bangkok's oldest temples.The consecrated water is used in two rituals at the Grand Palace. The first is the bath to ""purify"" the king, where the water is poured over his body while he wears a white robe. The second is to anoint the monarch. The king changes into his full regal vestments and is seated on an octagonal throne made of fig wood.Eight people pour the water on his hands - this time that will include Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn - the king's younger sister - Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, as well as Brahmins and royal court pandits (scholars).The use of water is based on a Brahmin tradition dating back centuries, experts say. The king then goes to the Bhadrapitha Throne and sits under the nine-tiered umbrella, where he is presented with the Royal Regalia. The crown is a more recent addition to royal tradition in Thailand, a concept popularised by European courts.Created in the reign of King Rama I in the 1782, it is made of gold and adorned with diamonds. It weighs 7.3kg, symbolising the weight of the responsibilities the king carries, according the Prof Tongthong.The Royal Sword of Victory represents wisdom in governing the country. According to legend, it was found at the bottom of the Tonle Sap lake in Siem Reap, Cambodia and given as a gift to King Rama I. It's said that when it arrived in Bangkok, seven lightning strikes hit the city simultaneously.After the crowning and investiture ceremonies King Vajiralongkorn - who holds the titles Rama X, or the 10th king of the Chakri dynasty - will present his first royal command. His father had said at the time of his coronation in 1950: ""I will reign with righteousness, for the benefit and happiness of the Thai people"".After the coronation rites, the king takes up ceremonial residence at the Grand Palace - referred to in simple terms as a housewarming party.In a private ceremony, at the Chakrapat Biman Royal Residence, he is escorted in by the women of the royal family.They bring with them a cat and a white rooster, a grinding stone, a tray of green gourd, a tray of rice seeds, a tray of beans and a tray of sesame seeds. The grains represent abundance and fertility in Thai agriculture. The significance of the cat is less straightforward. Some believe the owner of a new house should have a cat to chase away rats. Others believe the custom comes from a belief that cats expel demons and evil spirits, according to the Bangkok Post newspaper.He's also given a golden key to signify his ownership of the palace.In the days after the main ceremonies, the newly anointed king will take part in processions around Bangkok and make a public appearance on his balcony to give ordinary Thais an opportunity to pay their respects.Images courtesy of Ministry of Culture and Thailand PR department."
353,Profile: Thailand's King Vajiralongkorn,"Thailand's King Vajiralongkorn - his name means ""adorned with jewels or thunderbolts"" - was born on 28 July 1952, the first son and second child of Queen Sirikit and King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who had succeeded to the throne unexpectedly six years previously.After decades of uncertainty over royal succession, the birth of a male heir was seen as vital for the monarchy, at a time when its primacy in Thailand's political hierarchy was uncertain. The absolute monarchy had been overthrown in 1932, followed by an abdication in 1935, and 11 years in which the country had no sitting king.Thailand's lese majeste laws explainedObituary: King BhumibolIn King Vajiralongkorn's early years he was educated at a palace school in Bangkok. At the age of 13 he was sent to two private schools in the UK for five years, and then for a final year at a school in Sydney, Australia. He spent the following four years being trained at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in Canberra. By his own account, he struggled to keep up at school, blaming his pampered upbringing in the palace. He also found it hard to make the grade at Duntroon.He continued to receive advanced military training in Thailand, the UK, US and Australia, and became an officer in the Thai armed forces. He is a qualified civilian and fighter pilot, flying his own Boeing 737 when he travels overseas.He was formally given the title of Crown Prince by his father in an investiture ceremony in 1972, making him the official heir. But by that time questions were being raised about his fitness to succeed to the throne.He showed none of the enthusiasm of his younger sister Princess Sirindhorn for his father's development projects and there were persistent rumours of womanising, gambling and illegal businesses.In 1981 his mother, Queen Sirikit, alluded to these problems, describing her son as ""a bit of a Don Juan"" and suggesting that he preferred spending his weekends with beautiful women rather than performing duties.In a rare audience with Thai journalists in 1992, he denied the rumours that he was involved with mafia-like figures and underworld businesses.In 1977 he married his cousin Princess Soamsawali and they had their first child, Princess Bajarakitiyabha, in December 1978. However, by then he was involved with a young actress, Yuvadhida, with whom he had five children from 1979 to 1987. He married her in 1994, but in 1996 very publicly denounced her and disowned his four sons, who were studying in the UK.He married his third wife Srirasmi, a lady-in-waiting, in 2001, and had another son, Prince Dipangkorn, with her in 2005. In 2014 Srirasmi was stripped of her royal title and nine of her relatives, including her parents, were arrested for lese majeste on charges they had abused their connections with the Crown Prince. A police officer linked to the family died in custody after falling from a window.That charge, of abusing his name, has also been made against others who became close to the Crown Prince, notably a well known fortune teller who, together with another police officer, died after being arrested in 2015. At the same time, the Crown Prince's personal bodyguard was stripped of his rank for ""disobeying royal commands"" and ""threatening the monarchy by pursuing his own interests"". He disappeared and is believed to have died.For years he has been seen in the company of a former Thai Airways flight attendant, Suthida, who was made an officer of the Royal Household Guard, with the rank of Lieutenant-General. He also famously promoted his pet poodle Fu-Fu to the rank of Air Chief Marshall.In May 2019, days before his coronation, King Vajiralongkorn married her and the palace announced that she was to become Queen Suthida and will hold royal title and status as part of the royal family.The severity of the lese majeste law has prevented any open discussion of the new king's suitability inside Thailand. But privately, the possibility of Vajiralongkorn being passed over for his more popular and dutiful sister Sirindhorn was often talked about, encouraged by her own royal title being elevated in 1978 and by a change in palace succession law to allow a female to succeed to the throne.But that is only possible where there is no male heir, and King Bhumibol never supported the option of an alternative to his son.As King Bhumibol's health declined, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn began to be seen more often in public, performing traditional royal rituals on behalf of his father.In the past there were rumours of a business relationship between him and former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the telecoms tycoon whose party has won every election since 2001 and who was seen as a threat by much of the conservative royalist elite.But after the coup in 2014, which deposed the government of Thaksin's sister Yingluck, the new military rulers appeared to work with the Crown Prince to ensure his succession, helping organise events like mass bicycle rides in which he and his daughters participated, presenting a less formal image of the future king to the public.Just what kind of king Vajiralongkorn will make is hard to guess.Although a constitutional monarch, he will wield considerable power - for example, it is almost impossible for anyone in Thailand to reject the express wishes of the monarch.He also has a decisive say over the Crown Property Bureau, by far the wealthiest institution in Thailand, with assets valued at between $30-40bn (£24-32bn), giving the palace largely untaxed annual income of around $300m. And he commands his own personal regiment of the Royal Guard, comprising an estimated 5,000 troops.One advantage he will not have is the immense prestige and respect built by his father over 70 years on the throne, which Thai royal experts point out must be earned, not inherited. Vajiralongkorn, at the age of 66, will not have so long to make his mark on the monarchy. But he has had decades to observe and learn from the complex flow of power that surrounds the monarch.He presided over the elaborate and prolonged funeral rituals for the late king, giving him a chance to enhance his own standing in the process.He may well be able to rely on the lasting reverence for his father to shore up the monarchy's central role in Thai society."

The couple then sign a marriage registry.She and others are prostrated before the monarch, as is customary in Thailand.In 2014 Vajiralongkorn appointed Suthida Tidjai, a former flight attendant for Thai Airways, as the deputy commander of his bodyguard unit. He made her a full general in the army in December 2016.The previous king, Bhumibol Adulyadej, ruled for 70 years, making him the longest-reigning monarch in the world when he died in 2016."

He said he picked up the phone to try to find its owner and in doing so he moved it to a different location, which is considered theft under Thai law.Mr Dodd was released on bail after family and friends raised £20,000.Mr Dodd said he found the phone just as he was about to get into the taxi after arriving at Chiang Mai airport. He looked around to see if he could spot someone who may have dropped it but could not see anyone so he decided to take with him to the hostel to try to trace the owner from there.Soon after arriving at the hostel, Mr Dodd was arrested after police had seen him on CCTV picking it up.He said: ""I was stripped naked, sent in, given a blanket. Then the next thing you know you're being taken into the cells where they house massive amounts of people. ""Nobody spoke English. It was really intimidating. You just have to fight for a space on the floor and you have people's legs all over you.""He had faced a five-year prison term if convicted, but the charges against him were eventually waived and he could return home to the UK.Speaking to the BBC, Mr Dodd said his lawyer urged him to leave Thailand immediately after the prosecution dropped the case three days ago.His father Mike Dodd added: ""Over there money talks but, yes, it's [also] having a really good lawyer. [The money raised] enabled us to have a really good lawyer. That was fantastic."""

The navy said the couple had failed to seek permission from Thailand before constructing the home.If the couple are found guilty of violating Thailand's sovereignty they could face life in prison and even the death penalty.Mr Elwartowski reportedly worked as a software engineer for the US military before becoming an investor in the virtual currency Bitcoin.The couple belong to the so-called ""seasteading"" movement, which promotes the construction of homes in international waters so that they are not subject to any country's laws.They are also part of Ocean Builders, a group of entrepreneurs who work to fund such homes.In a video posted in February, Mr Elwartowski said the community was a place where ""freedom-loving people can all gather together and actually be free"".The disputed structure was built that month, but was only discovered by the authorities this week.A statement published on the Ocean Builders website says the couple did not build the home themselves and were in fact just tenants.""They spent a few weeks on the seastead and documented their adventure,"" it said.

It boasts its own flag, currency and even a football team.Several unofficial and unrecognised micronations have also emerged in Australia. These include Hutt River Province, a private estate 500km north of Perth, which announced it was seceding in 1970 in a row over wheat quotas. It also has its own flag and currency - the Hutt River Dollar.And the micronation of Akhzivland in the north of Israel had a population of just two for nearly half a century.That was until its founder and president, Eli Avivi, died last year aged 88."

362,Dog rescued 220km from Thai coast by rig workers,"A dog discovered some 220km (135 miles) off the coast of Thailand has been rescued by a team of oil rig workers after the exhausted pooch was spotted paddling near a drilling platform.The brown aspin swam towards the workers when they called out to him last Friday afternoon. He was then pulled to safety.It is not clear how the dog became stranded so far out at sea. Some reports suggest he may have fallen from a fishing trawler.The rig workers named the dog Boonrod, a Thai word that roughly translates as ""the saved one"" or ""survivor"".Boonrod was said to have been exhausted and in need of fresh drinking water and food.He was nursed back to health on the rig while staff radioed for help, requesting the assistance of a tanker that was heading back to shore. Boonrod had to have a proper wash to cleanse his fur of salt from the seawater. Afterwards, he had a nap. The conditions were said to have been calm during the rescue, which workers said made it easier to spot Boonrod among the rusty metal bars of the rig. Boonrod was lifted by crane on to an oil vessel that was passing through the area on Sunday to be transported to a veterinary practice in southern Thailand.The dog was said to have been in good spirits when he arrived on land to be taken to the vet.

Throwing water is meant to wash away bad luck from the previous year. In this image (above) elephants and people can be seen spraying water. Hundreds of thousands of tourists head to Thailand every year, mainly to Bangkok and larger cities to experience Songkran. Many people can be seen in bright floral clothes as they take part in the celebrations. In this image (below) a young boy sits on a person's shoulders as he is sprayed with water. On 15 April, the first day of Thai New Year, people gather at temples to offer food and new robes to the temple monks. All photos copyright. "
365,CentralWorld: Deadly blaze at Bangkok shopping complex,"At least two people have died after a fire broke out at a major Bangkok shopping centre complex on Wednesday.The fire, which has now been brought under control, reportedly started on the building's eighth floor at about 17:40 local time (10:40 GMT).At least one of those who died had fallen from the building, local reports and witnesses say.Videos on social media showed hundreds of people leaving the large shopping complex.Other clips showed emergency services struggling to get through gridlocked rush-hour traffic to get to the scene.At least 17 people have also been also injured, the Erawan Medical Emergency centre told AFP. The cause of the fire has not been confirmed. Bangkok's governor, Aswin Kwanmuang, told a Wednesday night news conference that an investigation into the blaze would start on Thursday. He also said the building would remain closed until deemed safe by officials. On their Facebook page, CentralWorld said (in Thai) that the fire was brought under control about 30 minutes after it started.The shopping centre's website describes it as the largest lifestyle shopping destination in Bangkok.It is also said to be the 11th largest complex of its kind in the world.

366,"Global executions fall to lowest level in a decade, Amnesty says","Annual executions recorded worldwide fell by almost a third in 2018 to the lowest figure in more than a decade, Amnesty International says.Some 690 people were executed in 20 countries last year, excluding China, a fall of 31% on 2017 - when 993 deaths were recorded.Executions in Iran fell by 50% after capital punishment was abolished for some drug offences, Amnesty found.Amnesty says thousands were probably killed in China but records are secret.That would make it by far the leading executioner.The next four nations are Iran, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam and Iraq. They account for about 77% of the 690.Amnesty's review of the use of the death penalty, which was released on Wednesday, says that while the number of executions have fallen in some countries, several others have seen a rise, including the US, Japan, Singapore, South Sudan and Belarus.""The dramatic global fall in executions proves that even the most unlikely countries are starting to change their ways and realise the death penalty is not the answer,"" Amnesty's secretary general, Kumi Naidoo, said.How many countries still have the death penalty?""This is a hopeful indication that it's only a matter of time before this cruel punishment is consigned to history, where it belongs.""Iran, which executes hundreds of people every year, mostly for drug offences, softened its drug crime laws in 2018. The move, which was applied retroactively, affected some 5,000 prisoners awaiting execution.At the end of last year, a total of 106 countries had abolished the death penalty for all crimes.The countries that saw significant falls in reported executions between 2017 and 2018 are: Iran - to 253 from 507 Iraq - to 52 from 125Pakistan - to 14 from 60Somalia - to 13 from 24Yes. Last year Thailand carried out its first execution since 2009, Amnesty found, while earlier this year Sri Lanka began a search for executioners as part of a crackdown on drug smuggling.Capital punishment is legal in Sri Lanka, where nearly 1,300 people are currently on death row, but no executions have taken place in the country since 1976.""These countries now form a dwindling minority,"" Mr Naidoo said, adding: ""To all the countries that still resort to the death penalty, I challenge you to act boldly and put a stop to this abhorrent punishment now.""

367,Dubai and other countries' laws which trip up travellers,"The case of the British woman facing jail in Dubai for calling her ex-husband's new wife a ""horse"" on Facebook is a stark reminder of the rules that can apply when you're abroad. Londoner Laleh Shahravesh, 55, was arrested at a Dubai airport after flying there to attend her former husband's funeral.She faces prosecution over two Facebook comments she posted on pictures of her husband remarrying in 2016.This case might be on the extreme end, but it's worth knowing the local laws and customs before travelling.In the past the government's Foreign and Commonwealth Office have encouraged people to do proper research.It said celebrity holiday snaps are inspiring us to take trips further afield where there are often unusual rules in place.Here are our top tips for staying safe.The lese-majeste law is a very old rule which states that it's a serious offence to insult any image of the Thai royal family. As the ruling monarch appears on the banknotes, it's actually a criminal act to step on it and you could end up in jail. Equally offensive in Thailand is throwing gum on the floor. There's a £400 fine or possibly jail if you don't pay up. It's a similar story in Singapore where, by law, chewing gum - all except the dental and nicotine kind - can't be bought or sold. In Barcelona, it was made illegal to wear swimwear anywhere in public away from the beach in 2011. It was after local people campaigned that there were too many scantily-clad tourists walking around the city.You could see yourself fined around £100 if you flout this rule.Don't relieve yourself in the ocean in Portugal. It's against the law and even though it's unclear how this can be enforced you should stick to the toilets. In Japan, due to strict anti-stimulant drug laws, something you've innocently packed to help with your cold could be banned.Pseudoephedrine is in things like Sudafed and Vicks inhalers and they're prohibited in the country.Be careful when you enter the country as you might be stopped and have them confiscated.If you're heading to France, make sure you leave your swim shorts at home - most swimming pools have a Speedo only rule. It's apparently for hygiene reasons and although it doesn't carry a penalty, you won't be allowed in without them. (Okay this isn't a law but it's still good to know!)Stick to the rules and, hopefully, you won't be one of hundreds of Britons who are arrested abroad each year.Recent stats suggest Spain, the United Arab Emirates, France, Thailand and the US are the top five places where the UK government provided help for the 829 people arrested in the year up to April 2017.If you do find yourself in trouble though you should ask that the local British embassy or consulate are notified (the local authorities must do this).Ask family or friends to contact the local British consulate or the Global Casework team at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) in London.Staff there will do what they can to help you, but they can't get you out of jail or help pay for a lawyer.They can, however, contact you in prison and inform your family and friends that you've been arrested. ""If you're taken the most important thing is that you don't sign a confession,"" says Radha Stirling the Founder and CEO of the campaign group, Detained in Dubai.""What they will say is if you sign this we will let you out and they never do. ""It's often a fabricated charge, so don't sign anything that you don't understand or can't read - it's the most dangerous, it's the number one thing.""Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here."
368,Thailand election: Future Forward's Thanathorn faces sedition charges,"The leader of a new political party that did well in Thailand's election last month has appeared at a police station to face charges of sedition.Scores of supporters greeted Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, the leader of Future Forward, at the Bangkok offices.Mr Thanathorn says an allegation, from 2015, that he aided a protest leader is politically motivated.The ruling military and an opposition coalition are both vying to form the next government following the polls.Thailand election: Full vote count in but no winner yetQuick guide to the post-coup pollsAt 40, he is the young and charismatic head of the Future Forward Party, which has appealed strongly to young voters and opposes the military government, which has been in charge of Thailand since 2014.Future Forward did well in March's election, finishing a strong third, gathering 6.2 million votes.It has since joined a ""democratic alliance"" to try to prevent the 2014 coup leader and current Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha from staying in power.They date back to 2015 and allege Mr Thanathorn gave assistance to the leader of anti-coup protesters, who violated laws on crowd gatherings.Mr Thanathorn is accused of breaking three articles of the Thai criminal code and could face up to nine years in prison if found guilty.He could also be disqualified from parliament.The charges have been filed by an officer in the government.Commenting on the delay in bringing the charges, police said there had been several reshuffles of personnel.Mr Thanathorn is also facing a cybercrime charge for allegedly spreading false information.Earlier in the week he said the charges were politically motivated, adding: ""The dark influence will not leave Future Forward Party alone.""As he left the police station on Saturday, he asked: ""Why does this come a week after the election?""We believe in our innocence, This isn't about me. This is about everyone who fights for justice.""Scores of supporters, many wearing the party's orange colour, shouted slogans backing Mr Thanathorn.They held up posters with the trending #SaveThanathorn hashtag and slogans such as ""end the age of the dinosaur"".The election results are not scheduled to be ratified until 9 May.Preliminary results suggest the party backing Gen Prayuth won the most popular votes, ahead of the Pheu Thai party, which is allied with exiled former PM Thaksin Shinawatra.But a complicated system of allocating seats in parliaments based on vote share, introduced by the military, means it remains unclear how many seats each party will ultimately have, hence the uncertainty on the next government.The BBC's South-East Asia correspondent, Jonathan Head in Bangkok, says the Election Commission has been indicating that fewer seats than expected will be given to Future Forward and Mr Thanathorn's supporters view the latest criminal charge against him as part of a wider campaign to keep his party out of power."

370,Thailand election: Full vote count in but no winner yet,"Nearly a week after Thailand's election, the first since the coup of 2014, it remains unclear which party could form a government.On Thursday, the Election Commission (EC) released the final vote count, showing the pro-military party had won the popular vote.However, the count has been marred by concerns over voting irregularities and official results are due by 9 May.Sunday's election had been billed as a return to democracy for Thailand. But the military was criticised for taking steps to ensure it would remain influential in politics, including appointing all 250 seats in the upper house.A complicated system of allocating seats in parliaments based on vote share, introduced by the military, means it remains unclear how many seats each party will ultimately have.The BBC's South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head explains the complexities around what just happened in Thailand.In previous Thai elections, the results came through more quickly and clearly. This time the EC had problems tabulating results from the 350 constituencies. On Sunday there were some crazy figures from a few. The voter turnout announced also seemed far too low at 65%. The EC abruptly stopped publishing numbers after the vote, failed to clarify the next day, blamed the media when its own data was suspect, and had some inconsistent statistics even when giving a final vote count on Thursday. It announced that, with 100% of the votes, counted;Palang Pracha Rath, the party allied with the ruling junta, has 8.4 million votesPheu Thai party, the opposition party allied with exiled former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, won 7.9 million votes.It isn't clear why the EC, with a very large budget and plenty of time, had these problems. It briefly mentioned hacking attacks on its servers on Sunday. But the inconsistencies - now raising the turnout to nearly 75% - have raised concern that the count is being manipulated, with a petition calling for the commission to be dismissed getting more than 800,000 signatures. The only international group able to monitor the election has been highly critical of the EC's poor performance.The new government will not be formed until the results are certified by 9 May, giving time for the EC to investigate alleged violations of election laws, and even to re-run the election in some areas, if needed. A vote in both houses of parliament for the next prime minister is expected within a few weeks after that. The betting has always been that Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha would keep his job, because the military-drafted constitution allows the 250-seat senate - appointed by the junta - to vote for a prime minister. But the unofficial results show a possible majority of seats in the lower house for a seven-party opposition coalition, led by the pro-Thaksin Pheu Thai. Whereas the pro-military Palang Pracha Rath is some way short of a majority. That means even if Gen Prayuth wins the vote for PM, his government could be paralysed in parliament. There is furious behind-the-scenes bargaining for support from the non-committed parties, like Bhum Jai Thai, with its valuable block of 50+ seats.ANFREL, the international monitoring group, has stopped short of labelling this election ""not free and fair"". But it is highly critical of the advantages given to the incumbent military government, of poor voter information and restrictions on freedom of expression. Many Thais suspect there was some rigging of the election, but no real evidence of this has been produced. Despite many reported irregularities, experienced election watchers here believe the published results probably reflect the broad preferences of Thai voters. Thaksin alleges Thai vote 'irregularities'Voting in Thailand's hybrid democracyThe Election Commission has lost a lot of credibility, and will be watched closely in the coming weeks, to see how fairly it deals with complaints, and how it allocates the 150 proportional party list seats. It has not said what method it will use, and different methods make a critical difference, one giving the opposition a majority, the other leaving it two seats short.Many younger Thais have expressed bitter disappointment over the strong performance of Palang Pracha Rath. In the rural north-east, die-hard Pheu Thai/Thaksin supporters have been dismayed by their own party's much weaker performance. Much now depends on the next six weeks. As things stand the anti-military coalition believes it commands a majority in the lower house, and while it cannot outvote Gen Prayuth for the prime minister's job, it can stop him governing. Its supporters believe the election has given them a mandate at least to stop the military from continuing to rule the country, and to force a different compromise. If the EC makes significant changes to the current seat estimates, either through the way it calculates the party list seats or through disqualifications for infractions of electoral regulations, expect some public outcry. Likewise, if the pro-military side persuades MPs to defect from the other side, to block a possible opposition majority, there could also be public anger. But few people believe there will be a repeat of the street protests and violence of previous years. Thais are, by and large, disillusioned by what those protests produced. There are new political forces now, which will look for different ways to express their dissent. A greater risk is the possibility of another military coup, if there is stalemate in parliament. The current army commander has hinted that the military would not support a government linked to Thaksin Shinawatra."
371,Thailand election: Evidence of ‘irregularities’ says ex-PM Thaksin,"Thailand's former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra has alleged that the election on Sunday was plagued with ""irregularities"".Mr Thaksin, who was ousted in 2006 and lives in self-imposed exile, told the BBC the inconsistencies ""worried"" him.The election was Thailand's first since a military coup in 2014 removed Mr Thaksin's sister, Yingluck Shinawatra.Early results saw the pro-military Palang Pracha Rath Party (PPRP) gain a larger share of the popular vote. But Pheu Thai - the party linked to Mr Thaksin which has won every election since 2001 - appears to have won the most seats overall.It remains unclear which party is most likely to be able to form a government.Official results will be released in May. Weeks of negotiations are expected until then as parties try to arrange coalitions.But there have been growing complaints about discrepancies in the voter turnout and number of ballots cast. Officials have said there were some cases of ""human error"" in reporting the data.   Mr Thaksin was removed by a coup in 2006. He now lives in self-imposed exile to avoid a conviction in Thailand for abuse of power, but remains hugely influential in Thai politics. Speaking to BBC Thai in Hong Kong, he said there were ""a lot of irregularities which made me worried to see the country's politics and electoral system so backward"".A guide to Thailand's post-coup electionThai rivals woo allies amid poll confusionMr Thaksin cited one example, saying there were ""pictures from Petchabun province where the ballot boxes were taken out and the ballot paper put back in at a local office"".He added that the number of ballot papers were higher than those casting the votes, adding that in many constituencies, the PPRP's vote ""just jumped all of a sudden... from third place to first place.""""In some constituencies, the PPRP switched from losing to winning... I see it as damaging and making our country lose its credibility,"" he said. Analysis by BBC's Jonathan Head in BangkokIn the five years since their coup the military junta and its conservative backers have tried to purge Thaksin Shinawatra from Thai politics, and failed. His name and image were barred from the election campaign, and parties risked dissolution if any links to him were found. Yet everyone knows his party, Pheu Thai, still refers to him for all important decisions. Pheu Thai supporters express open affection and nostalgia for his time as prime minister. He is a fixture they cannot remove. For now. Thai journalists flocked to Hong Kong to see him at his daughter's wedding last Friday. Now he has given a series of interviews.His party did worse than expected in the election. It won only half the votes it got in the 2011 election, and far fewer seats, though still more than any other party.Many of his supporters suspect electoral fraud, and will take his allegations of the same seriously. But there are always infractions and irregularities, as he calls them, in Thai elections. Whether these have significantly altered the overall result is not clear yet, but it seems unlikely, despite some shoddy handling of the results by the Election Commission. A wholesale rigging of the results would not have allowed the staunchly anti-military party Future Forward to do so well.Was the election rigged? In a way, yes, because the entire electoral system was weighted so heavily in favour of the pro-military party, especially the appointed 250-seat senate. But one of the few independent monitoring groups has cited poor preparation by the authorities and inadequate voter education as a principal cause of the unexpectedly low turnout, and a reason to describe the vote as not free and fair.Mr Thaksin's thoughts were echoed by many Thais on social media. On Monday, the hashtags ""Election Commission (EC) exposed"" and ""cheating election"" were trending. Some also questioned the reported turnout, which was unexpectedly low at 64%.The EC later said that media had misreported the data it was giving them, and that its servers had suffered from unspecified hacking attacks.Speaking to journalists, the EC's secretary-general, Charungvith Phumma, blamed ""human error"", saying the people who put the numbers of votes in were just regular people.At the time of the 2014 coup, the military said it wanted to restore order and stability and put a stop to the street protests which have broken out repeatedly over the years.But after seizing power, it introduced a new constitution which opponents say was designed to keep pro-military forces in power."
372,Thailand election: Thaksin alleges 'irregularities',"In an interview with BBC Thai, former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra alleges there were ""a lot of irregularities"" in Sunday's election in Thailand which have left him worried.

373,Thailand election: Rival camps woo allies amid confusion over results,"Two rival camps contesting Thailand's first election since the military coup in 2014 have both said they are trying to form a coalition government.Early results give the pro-military Palang Pracha Rath Party (PPRP) a larger share of the popular vote. At the same time, the main opposition Pheu Thai party currently has the biggest number of seats in parliament.But there are growing complaints about irregularities during Sunday's poll and a vote count marred by confusion.The Electoral Commission (EC) is also facing strong criticism for its decision to delay publishing the full results without providing any explanation.A guide to Thailand's post-coup electionVoting in Thailand's hybrid democracyThailand's complicated electoral system allocates some parliamentary seats according to the number of votes received. Critics say electoral law changes introduced by the military in 2017 are primarily designed to keep pro-military forces in power.On Monday, the EC announced that Pheu Thai, the party linked to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, had won 137 seats in the 500-strong lower chamber of parliament.The PPRP, which supports Thailand's current leader General Prayuth Chan-ocha, was in the second place with 97 seats. Several other parties were getting between 30 and 39 seats each. But the winners of 150 seats were still unclear, the EC said.At the same time, the commission earlier said that with more than 90% of ballots counted, the PPRP had gained 7.6m of the popular vote. That is half a million more than Pheu Thai. Amid confusion over a vote count, the EC was expected to clarify the preliminary results at a news conference on Monday. But the EC instead again delayed announcing the preliminary figures. It also said there would be no official results until 9 May.More than 50 million people were eligible to vote in a much-delayed election, the first since Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha led the coup that ousted Mr Thaksin's sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, five years ago.But the reported turnout was unexpectedly low, at just 64%. Many questioned this figure as well as discrepancies in the vote count numbers.""It's right that we should call it a rigged election,"" Mr Thaksin told AFP news agency.""Everyone know(s) in Thailand, everyone internationally that observed the election in Thailand, knows that there is irregularity.""Speaking to journalists, the EC's secretary-general, Charungvith Phumma, blamed ""human error"", saying the people who put the numbers of votes in were just regular people.The EC later said that media had misreported the data it was giving them, and that its servers had suffered from unspecified hacking attacks.Analysis by BBC's Nick Beake in BangkokWhat's your definition of an election winner? Answers on a polling card, please. Is it the party with the most votes across the whole country or the party with the most seats in parliament? In Thailand, where power can be seized at gunpoint, this is not so much a constitutional technicality but a matter of manoeuvring and momentum. After repeatedly promising - and then delaying - a national vote, the military junta finally granted a ballot only once it had successfully manipulated the electoral system in its favour. Many foresaw a General Prayuth victory as being hollow and illegitimate - achieved through the backing of a handpicked, new senate. But the coup leader can now point to the way the pro-military Palang Pracha Rath Party apparently hoovered up the majority of votes cast as a clear democratic mandate. The opposition Pheu Thai does not see it that way. It feels its own achievement - gaining the biggest share of parliamentary seats - should be rewarded fairly by being allowed to form a coalition of anti-military parties. The military introduced a new constitution in 2017 which opponents say is designed to keep pro-military forces in power. Thailand's electorate only votes for the 500-seat lower house of parliament. The members of the 250-seat upper house are appointed by the military. But it's the combined votes from both houses that will select the future prime minister.The vote has been seen primarily as a contest between pro-military parties and allies of Mr Thaksin.He was ousted in a coup in 2006 and lives in self-imposed exile to avoid a conviction for abuse of power. But he still has a significant following, largely among rural and less affluent voters. At the time of the 2014 coup, the military said it wanted to restore order and stability and put a stop to the street protests which have broken out repeatedly over the years. But the junta has been accused of taking an authoritarian approach to power, strictly controlling the media and arbitrarily using laws like lese majeste - which prohibits any criticism of the monarchy - to silence opponents.

374,Thailand election: Quick guide to the post-coup polls,"Thailand has held its first general election since a military coup in 2014.The country has long been politically split between populists largely tapping into the rural and poorer sections of the population, and their opponents who tend to support the military and win votes from the urban middle class and elites.A new constitution, introduced under the military leadership, changed the electoral process in a way that makes it likely it will retain control.This means the country looks set to remain deeply divided between pro-military forces and their populist opponents.The election is seen as a culmination of a decade-long struggle by the military and political establishment to curb the influence of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The billionaire businessman rose to power in the 2001 by mobilising poorer, rural areas that felt increasingly left behind by the country's economic progress. He was ousted in 2006 by a military coup and his sister Yingluck Shinawatra, who followed him into politics suffered the same fate eight years later. Voting in Thailand's hybrid democracyWhile there's hope this election will help usher Thailand towards democracy, there's also ample reason to be cautious. Thailand is no stranger to political disruption and instability. The 2014 coup was the 12th time the military has toppled the government since the end of absolute monarchy in the 1930s.If all goes well for the military, the coup leader and current Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha will stay in power, backed by a political majority. If things don't go well for them, he is likely to remain in power - but with a minority government facing political gridlock. The military in 2017 introduced a new constitution which critics say is primarily designed to keep pro-military forces in power. How? Thailand's electorate only votes for the 500-seat lower house of parliament. The members of the 250-seat upper house are appointed by the military. But it's the combined votes from both houses that will select the future prime minister. Let's do the maths: Opposition groups would need 376 of those votes to get their candidate elected. And all those 376 must come from the lower house. The senators, appointed by the military, are likely to back the military's candidate. Hence, Gen Prayuth is highly likely to remain in power, even if parties backing him don't do so well at the ballot box. Clearly, this would be the least desirable outcome for the military. Gen Prayuth would have a hard time governing with only minority backing in the lower house. Yet a prime minister from the Thaksin camp is extremely unlikely - they'd need a landslide win of some 75% to get those 376 seats. Pheu Thai, the party founded by Mr Thaksin, is expected to once again be the strongest party. It's still seen as a vehicle for its founder's populist policies although Mr Thaksin himself can't run or return should they win. Both he and his sister Yingluck are currently in self-imposed exile and wanted in Thailand on charges of abuse of power and negligence, so the party has picked close Thaksin-ally Sudarat Keyuraphan as candidate. As the new constitution introduced a ceiling on how many seats each party can win, Pheu Thai has created smaller splinter parties to get around that.One such party was Thai Raksa Chart, seen largely as a proxy for Pheu Thai.Thai Raksa Chart was at the heart of a major political drama when in February a sister of the king was listed as the party's candidate for prime minister.Traditionally, the royals are not involved in politics and her announcement sent shockwaves through the political establishment. Soon after though, the king criticised her political bid and so she withdrew. Thai Raksa Chart was subsequently dissolved by the constitutional court. Pro-Thaksin parties now have very little chance of winning an outright majority in the lower house, although Pheu Thai is still expected to be by some margin the largest party.The princess and Thailand's political gamesOn the other side of the political spectrum are the main backers of the military junta: Palang Pracha Rath (PPRP) - Power of the People's State - which was formed last year. Gen Prayuth is its sole candidate for prime minister.  An ex-general, he was one of the leaders of the 2014 coup but has since retired from the military and became civilian prime minister. The oldest establishment party is called the Democrats. While clearly in the anti-Thaksin camp, they have also explicitly ruled out backing pro-military forces. A new party in the race is Future Forward which is also opposed to the military and is thought to possibly back Pheu Thai. The military's struggle to win parties to support its side means the post-election outcome remains uncertain. If pro-military forces do very poorly, Mr Prayuth may still be elected as prime minister but would have a very hard time governing and could lose credibility among voters. The two sides of Thailand's political divide have a history of taking their cause to the streets. Over the past decade, protests by the pro-Thaksin Red Shirts versus the pro-establishment Yellow Shirts have several times paralysed Bangkok, raising the spectre of a possible escalation into violence. The recent constitutional changes are clearly geared to keeping the military in power. While they are likely to do exactly that, this will also make it a lot easier for the losing side to discredit the vote. This in turn could lead to political gridlock, tensions and even fresh unrest.

377,Thailand votes in first post-coup election,"Thai voters have taken part in the country's first general election since the 2014 coup.Thailand has been buffeted by political instability for years, largely a battle between supporters of the military and ousted former PM Thaksin Shinawatra. After seizing power the army promised to restore order and democracy, but has repeatedly postponed the vote.Critics say a new constitution the army introduced will ensure it remains influential whatever the outcome. More than 50 million people are eligible to vote and the authorities said turnout could be as high as 80%. More than seven million people aged between 18-26 have the right to vote for the first time and could be key to victory, so all parties have been keen to court their vote. A guide to Thailand's post-coup electionVoting in Thailand's hybrid democracyThe princess and Thailand's political gamesOn the eve of the election, Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn issued a statement urging ""peace and order"" during the voting process. The statement, which was featured on national television on Saturday evening, urged voters to ""support the good people"". By Nick Beake, BBC News, BangkokVoters in central Bangkok faced a final obstacle as they tried to cast their ballot - determined runners steaming through the park where an open-air polling station had been set up. But after waiting five years since the military coup, Thais are determined to finally have their say on their country's future - even if the electoral system has been skewed by the ruling junta to try to keep them in power.The beaming faces of the 31 different candidates here in the Klong Toey constituency look out from a big poster which provides a last-minute visual guide for those picking up their ballot papers. Really, though, this election boils down to a simple choice - do you want the army to stay in power?  We meet Peerasin, 23, who is one of seven million first-time voters. He and his mum explain that they're hopeful for change but that dad is more conservative. Dad nods and smiles in agreement. Next, a family of eight arrive to cast their votes. Sisters Mai, a banker and May, who works in the pharmaceutical industry, say they don't talk politics at home. But that doesn't mean they don't have passionate opinions. So what's your message to whoever wins power, I ask.""The country has been suffering for a long time"", Mai explains. ""But we hope this election will end peacefully and that there will be no corruption. We are hopeful.""The election is primarily a contest between pro-military parties and allies of Mr Thaksin.He was ousted in a coup in 2006 and lives in self-imposed exile to avoid a conviction for abuse of power. But he still has a significant following, largely among rural and less affluent voters. Parties loyal to Mr Thaksin have won every election since 2001, and the BBC's South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head says crippling this movement has been a central - if unofficial - objective of the military.Pheu Thai (For Thais) is the leading Thaksin-loyal party campaigning this time.General Prayuth Chan-ocha, who led the coup which ousted Mr Thaksin's sister Yingluck Shinawatra in 2014, has been nominated as the only prime ministerial candidate of the newly formed pro-military Palang Pracha Rath Party (PPRP).Among other prominent parties are the Democrats, led by former prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, and the new Future Forward party, led by a young billionaire, Thanatorn Juangroongruangkit.At the time of the coup, the military said it wanted to restore order and stability and prevent the street protests which have broken out repeatedly over the years. But the junta has been accused of taking an authoritarian approach to power, strictly controlling the media and arbitrarily using laws like lese majeste - which prohibits any criticism of the monarchy - to silence opponents. It also introduced a constitution - approved by a referendum - which its critics say is designed to ensure it remains central in Thai politics.

But under the constitution, a 250-seat senate has been appointed by the military. The two houses will together elect a prime minister - a candidate only needs half the votes plus one to win. So the military's preferred candidate - Gen Prayuth - would in theory only need 126 lower house votes to take office. The governing party or coalition can also appoint a non-MP as prime minister. The new constitution also imposes a limit on the number of seats any one party can take, regardless of the number of votes won, and any future government is constitutionally bound to follow the military's 20-year plan for Thailand.Preliminary unofficial results will emerge within hours, but correspondents say it will take some time for the future direction of Thailand to become clear, as parties negotiate deals and coalitions."

379,Family of 'Thai bride' want ashes returned,"The family of a Thai woman who has finally been identified 15 years after being found dead in the Yorkshire Dales want to return her ashes to Thailand.Police said the woman discovered near Pen-y-ghent in 2004 was Lamduan Armitage, nee Seekanya.Because her identity was unknown, villagers named her The Lady of the Hills and she was buried at St Oswald's Church in Horton-in-Ribblesdale.The family want to bring her back so they can ""put her at peace"".In January, her parents Buasa and Joomsri Seekanya contacted North Yorkshire Police after reading a BBC story about the case. The family, from Udon Thani in north-east Thailand, said they had not heard from their daughter, who had married an English man David Armitage, since 2004.The force carried out extensive inquiries and DNA testing with family members in Thailand in order to confirm her identity.Mrs Seekanya, who broke down in tears when she was told the confirmation, said: ""I'm saddened by this news, to finally know that it's my daughter.""I had already prepared myself when I saw the story of the Lady of the Hills.""On behalf of the family, the Thai Women Network in the UK, has started a JustGiving page to raise £5,000 to return her ashes so a religious ceremony can be held. It is understood the family want her body to be exhumed and cremated and then her ashes to be returned to Thailand. Exhumation of remains require a Home Office licence issued by the Ministry of Justice.Ms Armitage's half-naked body was found face down in a stream by walkers on 20 September 2004.She was found more than a mile (2km) from the nearest road and was wearing only green jeans, socks and a gold wedding band.Despite extensive appeals, police were unable to identify her and the parish council donated a burial plot and organised her funeral.Every year a memorial service for her has been held at the church. Malcolm Pearce, one of the walkers who found her body, said: ""It's incredibly sad but at least this is some peace for her poor family who have suffered anguish for all these years.""Police are now investigating her death and want to speak to anyone who may have known her or her family.They said she moved to the UK in 1991 after marrying Mr Armitage in Thailand, and lived in Portsmouth, Rugby and Preston.The force is looking to interview members of Ms Armitage's family and carry out further inquiries in Thailand in due course."
380,Thailand election: A vote for a hybrid democracy,"When the Thai army seized power in May 2014, it described it as a coup to end all coups. The army had failed to do the job properly during the previous attempt, in 2006, one of the coup leaders told us in 2014. This time we will fix things so we never have to intervene again, he said.The official script of the coup makers was that they intervened to end the crippling political turmoil which had shaken Thailand for most of the previous decade. Less officially though, the junta had two objectives; to secure the first royal succession in 70 years, which, after the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej in 2016, it did; and to cripple the political movement loyal to ousted former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, which had won every election since 2001. This movement is viewed as an existential threat to the alliance of palace, military and big business that has dominated Thailand for most of its modern history.The election taking place this Sunday in Thailand has to be understood within the context of this last objective. Far from conceding the political playing field to civilian politicians, the military is campaigning to stay in power, and has tilted the field in its own favour. General Prayuth Chan-ocha, the man who led the coup, and has been prime minister since then, hopes to keep his job. To that end, a new political party, calling itself Palang Pracha Rath (PPRP) - Power of the People's State - was formed last year. The princess and Thailand's political gamesThailand country profile It is backed by many officials who have served in the military government, and has co-opted a number of big-name local politicians from other parties. Gen Prayuth is its sole candidate for prime minister, even though parties are allowed to designate three.The military has also drafted a much-criticised constitution, which allows a wholly appointed 250-seat senate to join the vote in parliament for the next prime minister. It has introduced a new voting system which disadvantages Thailand's biggest party, the pro-Thaksin Pheu Thai, by imposing a ceiling on the number of seats it can win.Despite these clear advantages to the military, the election is being strongly contested. Polls suggest voter turnout will be high. Loyalty to Pheu Thai remains strong in its north and north-eastern heartland, although it is barred from using the names or images of Thaksin or his sister Yingluck, both popular former prime ministers and lacks the rousing policies and personalities of its previous campaigns. The Democrats, traditionally the second-largest party after Pheu Thai and its main rival, have ruled out joining a coalition headed by Gen Prayuth - although they have kept open the option of working with his party - as has the mid-sized party Bhum Jai Thai. And an exciting new player, calling itself Future Forward and headed by a telegenic young billionaire, has joined the fray, promising sweeping reform. Future Forward is proving especially popular with younger Thais; seven million will be eligible to vote for the first time in this election.These factors have cast a shadow over the military's ambition to hold onto power. In polls large numbers of people say they have not made up their minds; given the repressive climate under the military government, many prefer not to say. Gen Prayuth remains personally popular - people like his gruff, straightforward manner, and he has a relatively uncorrupt reputation. But despite efforts to soften his image, with photographs distributed of the normally stern-looking strongman now smiling in pastel-coloured jackets and shirts, he has been reluctant to campaign, and his party has struggled to excite the voters. Its rallies have been low-octane and thinly-attended.Add to that a slow-moving economy on its watch, rising costs of living for low-income Thais, and a collapse of prices for vital rural commodities like rubber, sugar and rice, and the military government's core message is reduced largely to offering continued stability, together with a few populist promises like raising the minimum wage. This is not enough to swing the allegiance of most Thaksin loyalists. A string of corruption scandals, and plain weariness with a regime that promised an election within a year or two of seizing power, but then repeatedly delayed, are also likely to cost the pro-military party support.One sign of nerves in the military camp are the dubious criminal charges it continues to file against its opponents, especially the popular young leader of Future Forward, Thanatorn Juangroongruangkit. It did, however, score a notable tactical victory over the pro-Thaksin camp when one of its parties, Thai Raksa Chart, was dissolved by the constitutional court over the nomination of King Vajiralongkorn's older sister as its candidate for prime minister, a celebrity royal who would have given Thaksin's allies a dramatic advantage. Without Thai Raksa Chart in the race, the pro-Thaksin camp has little chance of reaching its target of a majority of the seats in parliament. So Thai voters are left with a range of choices. Pheu Thai and Future Forward are presenting themselves as the pro-democracy, anti-military camp. Each is promising to curb the pervasive influence of the armed forces in civilian affairs. Palang Pracha Rath is offering a continuation of the status quo. And the other parties are trying to woo voters with policies that appeal to their pockets, like Bhum Jai Thai's undertaking to legalise marijuana as an alternative cash crop. In many areas, voters are likely to stick to well-known local politicians, on their records of delivering benefits to their constituencies, regardless of their party affiliation - one reason the military has tried hard to win defectors from older parties.Because the military-appointed senate helps select the new prime minister, Gen Prayuth has a huge advantage. His party, plus any allies who join him, needs only 126 of the 500 seats in the lower house. In addition, all future administrations are bound by the constitution to adhere to the military's 20-year plan for Thailand, restricting their options for introducing crowd-pleasing policies.  The notoriously conservative constitutional court is empowered to take drastic action against any government which deviates from this policy straitjacket.But if the anti-military parties do well - and Pheu Thai is almost certain to be the largest party by a significant margin - they will challenge the legitimacy of any government led by Gen Prayuth. The new government will also need to bring in enough coalition allies to function in the lower house; it cannot rely on the senate alone.Everything depends on how each of the larger parties performs, and that is hard to predict. If Palang Pracha Rath does well, exceeding 80 seats, it will probably attract coalition partners quickly. But they will bargain hard for cabinet positions, and the coalition, likely comprising several parties, could be unstable. If Palang Pracha Rath performs worse than expected, its efforts to keep Gen Prayuth in power will be challenged more forcefully, and Thailand may experience more political turmoil.It will take time to confirm and assess the election results. All parliamentary horse-trading will in any case cease for the king's coronation in early May. But when it resumes, many of the ingredients of Thailand's long political conflict will still be there. Despite earlier promises of reconciliation, five years of military rule have done very little to resolve it."
381,'Thai bride' body found on Yorkshire Dales in 2004 identified,"A woman whose body was found in the Yorkshire Dales 15 years ago has been identified, police have confirmed.North Yorkshire Police said the woman who was found near Pen-y-ghent in 2004 was Lamduan Armitage, nee Seekanya.She moved to the UK in 1991 after marrying her husband David Armitage in Thailand, and lived in Portsmouth, Rugby and Preston.Officers investigating Ms Armitage's death want to speak to anyone who may have known her or her family.Mr Armitage has said he was not involved in his wife's death, according to The Sun.The force carried out extensive inquiries and DNA testing with family members in Thailand in order to confirm Ms Armitage's identity.More news and stories from across YorkshireOfficers said in a statement they were continuing to ""build a picture of Lamduan's life in Thailand and at various places she lived in the UK between 1991 and 2004"".""It is also understood that Lamduan visited Thailand at some point between 2003 and 2004, but it is not known which part of the country she went to,"" they added.The force is looking to interview members of Ms Armitage's family and carry out further inquiries in Thailand in due course.A woman's half-naked body was found face down in a stream by walkers on 20 September 2004.She was found more than a mile (2km) from the nearest road and was wearing only green jeans, socks and a gold wedding band.However, police were unable to identify her and she became known as The Lady of the Hills.A cold case review, launched in 2016, concluded she was aged between 25 and 35 and originally from south-east Asia.Investigators also found evidence she had been living in north Lancashire or south Cumbria, with detectives suggesting she could have been a ""Thai bride"".Speaking in October, Adam Harland, manager of the North Yorkshire and Cleveland Police cold case review team, said: ""[It is possible] she is a lady who has taken up a relationship with a white gentleman, and come back to the UK.""Mr Harland said it was likely she had been killed and brought to the location in Ribblesdale in a 4x4.In January, Buasa and Joomsri Seekanya came forward to say they believed the woman was their daughter Lamduan.The family, from Udon Thani in north-east Thailand, said they had not heard from her since 2004.Mrs Seekanya said at the time: ""A part of me hopes that it's not my daughter - I want her to come back alive.

382,Thai tycoon found guilty for poaching but freed ahead of appeal,"The head of one of Thailand's largest construction firms has been sentenced to 16 months in jail on three poaching charges but is free pending an appeal.Premchai Karnasuta was caught with hunting gear and animal carcasses, including a black panther, in a protected sanctuary in February 2018.Three of his employees, but not Premchai, were found guilty on Tuesday of possessing the panther carcass.The case had sparked an outcry over the impunity of the rich and powerful. Premchai is head of Italian-Thai Development, a Bangkok-based firm that helped build the capital's Suvarnabhumi airport and Skytrain rail link.The high-profile case has been closely followed in Thailand, where convictions for poaching happen often but rarely when it comes to prominent people.The 64-year-old was found guilty of possessing the carcass of a Kalij pheasant and firearms in public areas, and supporting others to hunt in a protected wildlife sanctuary.His cook and driver were given lesser sentences, while his hunting guide was the only one found guilty of hunting and was sentenced to three years and five months.Premchai was granted bail of 400,000 baht (£9,500, $12,600) as the court did not consider him a flight risk.Park rangers arrested the construction magnate after finding him and three others camped at Thungyai Naresuan national park.The men were found with three rifles, 143 bullets and other hunting tools, and a slain black panther, Kalij pheasant and barking deer - all protected species under Thai conservation law.The wildlife sanctuary in western Thailand is home to wild elephants, tigers and many endangered species, according to Thailand's Wildlife Friends Foundation.Local wildlife groups praised the authorities for detaining the four men last year. Striking images of the skinned black panther went viral and inspired protests and graffiti across Bangkok calling for an investigation.Some political parties have even used the photos in their campaigning ahead of Sunday's general election, vowing for an improved justice system.""Justice is meted out unequally,"" Steve Galster of wildlife organisation Freeland Foundation told news agency AFP. ""The main thing is this is a public shaming [for Premchai],"" he said, adding he hopes the court ""will stick with the decision"" after his appeal."
383,Thailand elections: Party that nominated Princess Ubolratana for PM dissolved,"Thailand's top court has dissolved an opposition party that nominated the king's sister as its candidate for prime minister.Thai Raksa Chart is backed by exiled ex-PM Thaksin Shinawatra, who was deposed by a military coup in 2006.Analysts say dissolving the party will make it harder for Mr Thaksin's supporters to win the national election due later this month. Thailand is run by the military, which took over in a coup five years ago.The Constitutional Court, which issued Thursday's ruling, said Princess Ubolratana's nomination threatened the neutrality of the monarchy.The party's executive board members have been banned from politics for 10 years, and it can no longer contest the election.""The monarchy is above politics, and to maintain political neutrality, the king, the queen and princesses can never exercise political rights by casting votes,"" Judge Nakharin Mektrairat said at the end of an extensive ruling.Princess power play renews old rivalries in ThailandWho is Princess Ubolratana?Thailand: Land of military coupsA royal candidate would have given forces loyal to Mr Thaksin a decisive advantage in this month's election, says the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok. Thursday's move will rob the pro-Thaksin camp of enough parliamentary seats to put its goal of winning a majority in the election almost certainly out of reach, our correspondent adds.Thai Raksa Chart was seen largely as a proxy for Pheu Thai, the main pro-Thaksin party, to get more seats, analysts say.A new 2017 constitution introduced a rule that there would be a ceiling on how many seats each party could win. The 24 March vote will be the first since the current Prime Minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, took power in a 2014 military coup - overthrowing the democratically elected government."
384,Airlines reroute to avoid Pakistan,"Airlines operating flights from East Asia to destinations in Europe are having to reroute their planes away from Pakistan and northern India.The airspace is closed because of escalating tension between the two countries, following the shooting down of two Indian military jets.Flights via Pakistan have been cancelled and other flights rerouted.Thai Airways has taken the more drastic step of suspending all its flights destined for Europe.With flight space south of Pakistan becoming crowded, the Bangkok-based airline has not been able to establish alternative routes for its flights. ""By closing the airspace, every flight from Thailand to Europe has been affected. For flights that are going to depart this evening, we will call an urgent meeting to consider the impact of such events,"" said Thai Airways president Sumeth Damrongchaitham.Singapore Airlines and British Airways are among the operators which have had to reroute flights. Singapore Airlines said longer flight routes would make refuelling necessary.Alex Seftel, who works as a journalist, was en route from Bangkok to London on Wednesday on a flight with Taiwanese operator Eva Air. The flight was turned back over Calcutta in northern India.""We were on the flight, a couple of hours in, and I noticed on the flight route map that it was going in the opposite direction,"" he said.  ""There was a lot of circling around and we had very little information until we got into the airport.""Back in Bangkok, passengers waited several hours for an explanation before being transferred to a hotel for the night, with a new flight provisionally scheduled for early Thursday.Some international flights have been rerouted through Mumbai on India's western coast. Mark Martin, founder and chief executive at Martin Consulting India, said about 800 flights a day used the India-Pakistan air corridor, making it ""very critical"".""You can't overfly China, so you have to overfly Pakistan and India and go to South East Asia and Australia. Most of the traffic destined for Bangkok and Singapore will have to fly over Iran and then possibly take a detour,"" he said.The recent flare-up between Indian and Pakistan over the disputed region of Kashmir began when a suicide car bomb killed 40 Indian paramilitary police on 14 February. India retaliated with an airstrike on what it said was a militant training base on Tuesday.Indian domestic airlines, including IndiGo, Go Air, Jet Airways and Vistara, cancelled services in northern India because of airport closures, although Indian airports later resumed operations.Have you been affected by these flight cancellations?

385,Thai cave diver John Volanthen awarded George Medal by Queen,"A cave diver who helped to rescue 12 Thai footballers and their coach has been awarded the George Medal by the Queen for showing ""great courage"". Diver John Volanthen and his colleague Richard Stanton were the first to find the stranded team, which led to their eventual rescue last year.Mr Volanthen, 47, said he was ""highly honoured"" to receive the award.He said: ""The biggest reward I could have was knowing all the children survived.""Mr Volanthen, from Long Ashton, near Bristol said: ""We knew we'd find the children, but we didn't expect to find them alive. We saw the amount of rainfall and the type of flooding and it seemed unlikely anyone would survive.""As well as being the first to make contact with the stranded footballers, Mr Volanthen also rescued three of the boys himself.He was part of a team of four divers who guided the sedated footballers through the cave system on their way out.Since the football team was rescued, work has started on a number of films portraying the rescue. ""It's been suggested Rowan Atkinson could play me, and I quite like that idea,"" he said.""There could be a comedy version somewhere along the line.""The 47-year-old diver is no stranger to rescues as part of the South and Mid Wales Cave Rescue Team. In 2010 he was part of a team which attempted to rescue a trapped diver in France, who was later found dead.For his work in that rescue, he received a Royal Humane Society medal at Buckingham Palace in 2012.Mr Volanethen grew up in Brighton, and his love of caving began as a scout. He is a cub leader for the Long Ashton branch, near his current home of Bristol.He was also recently awarded the Bronze Cross, the scouting organisation's highest honour, for his role in the Thai cave rescue.Outside of his work he runs marathons and ultramarathons, once joking that he only does it ""so he can eat more biscuits"".The George Medal was introduced by King George VI in 1940, as a way to recognise brave civilian acts that were carried out away from enemy forces, and has been awarded more than 2,000 times.It is the second highest civilian honour after the George Cross.Posthumous recipients of the medal include PC Keith Palmer, who was fatally stabbed outside the Houses of Parliament in March 2017 during the Westminster terror attack."

Her unprecedented nomination broke with the tradition of the Thai royal family publicly staying out of politics.King Vajiralongkorn had called her bid ""extremely inappropriate"". Princess power play renews old rivalries in ThailandPosting on her private Instagram account, the princess wrote: ""I am sad that the sincere intention to work for the country and us Thais has created a problem that shouldn't happen in this day and age.""The photo she posted - of a scenic garden - also included the hashtag #HowComeItsTheWayItIs.The announcement that Princess Ubolratana would stand for election sent shockwaves through Thai politics last Friday.The US-educated Thai princess relinquished her royal title when she married an American man in 1972. She returned to Thailand in 2001 after they divorced and has maintained a quasi-celebrity status since - appearing on the entertainment circuit and in music videos.Who is Princess Ubolratana?Thailand: Land of military coupsShe was nominated as a candidate for the upcoming general election by Thai Raksa Chart last week - a party allied to divisive former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The March vote will be the first since the current Prime Minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, took power in a 2014 military coup - overthrowing the democratically-elected government.The royal family and electoral officials condemned her candidacy almost immediately after it was announced.The country's election panel said it had excluded Princess Ubolratana because ""every member of the royal family comes within the application of the same rule requiring the monarch to be above politics and to be politically neutral"".The stance echoed a palace statement, which said the ""involvement of a high-ranking member of the royal family in politics... is considered extremely inappropriate"".The row over the princess has reignited old rivalries. Royalists have come out to accuse Mr Thaksin of once again trying to exploit the monarchy for his own ambitions. Frustrated supporters of the pro-Thaksin camp, who have been waiting for five years to demonstrate their voting power, fear their side will be tarnished once again as a threat to the monarchy, in order to keep a military-dominated government in power. This is now bound to be a more heated election campaign.Read more from Jonathan here.Thai Raksa Chart's leader, Preechaphol Pongpanit, has said his partydid everything ""sincerely, with good intentions"", but added: ""Above us is His Majesty and the monarchy. We are ready to be investigated.""The electoral commission confirmed on Wednesday that it was seeking to punish Thai Raksa Chart for violating electoral law. It described the party's nomination of the king's sister as ""antagonistic toward the constitutional monarchy"" and said it will ask the country's Constitutional Court to consider dissolving them.Princess Ubolratana's latest post on Instagram will appear to some as a quiet rebuke of the events of the past week. It's difficult to know just how much direct communication she has had with her brother about this since the fallout - but it's likely she will now have to retreat from political life, no matter how she feels about it. "
388,Thailand election: Princess Ubolratana and the party power play,"Until last Friday, expectations of next month's general election in Thailand had been underwhelming.The military clique which seized power nearly five years ago had spent that time crafting a constitution and electoral system specifically to ensure its influence extended over future governments regardless of the outcome of the election. It also did this to minimise the seats that could be won by parties allied to its nemesis - former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who now lives in exile. Those parties included a new one, Thai Raksa Chart, which was established in November last year with the aim of getting around the ceiling on party list seats that can be won, a ceiling that in particular affects the main pro-Thaksin party Pheu Thai.Everyone knew Thai Raksa Chart was just another vehicle for Mr Thaksin and his allies to try to break the shackles put on them by the new constitution. The real question hanging over this, the first election in eight years, was whether the pro-Thaksin parties would do well enough to form a government, and what the military could do to stop them.The stunning announcement that Princess Ubolratana, elder sister of King Maha Vajiralongkorn, was Thai Raksa Chart's sole candidate for prime minister changed everyone's calculations in an instant. The party was exploiting a clause inserted by the military into the constitution to allow for an unelected prime minister, a device to allow coup-leader Prayuth Chan-ocha to stay in office. It calculated that this could also apply to an unelected princess, who now describes herself as a commoner, having given up her titles when she married an American 46 years ago.  But in Thailand she is still treated like royalty. How would it even work, to have a royal, by custom beyond criticism, take part in competitive democratic politics? And surely, it was assumed, she must have had the king's approval for such an unprecedented move - which then suggested he was aligning himself with Mr Thaksin, often accused of being anti-monarchy, against the ultra-royalist military and their allies. Who is Princess Ubolratana?Thai princess 'sad' about election falloutSuch a scenario radically altered the power dynamics in Thailand.Within hours the king put a stop to this manoeuvre, issuing a royal decree stating that Princess Ubolratana was still treated as a high-ranking member of the royal family, and involving her in politics was ""highly inappropriate"". To be on the receiving end of such explicit royal disapproval would normally be a devastating blow in Thailand. By Saturday there were rumours the executive board of Thai Raksa Chart would be detained, though these were unfounded.By Monday her nomination had been declared invalid by the Election Commission, which is now set to ask the Constitutional Court to consider dissolving the party.If this is done before 9 May, the deadline for certifying victorious MPs, Thai Raksa Chart and its politicians will be eliminated from the election.With its demise, Mr Thaksin's hopes of his parties forming the next government would be dashed. On its own, under the new electoral system, Pheu Thai has no hope of repeating its success in the 2011 election of winning an outright majority of seats in the lower house of parliament. The 250-seat upper house, or senate, is entirely appointed, its members nearly all expected to vote for Gen Prayuth to remain in office after the election. Had Princess Ubolratana remained a candidate, some, maybe most senators might have switched their loyalty to her.Royalism has become embedded in Thai society as a quasi-state religion. Everyone is required to show fulsome loyalty to the monarchy, whatever their private beliefs, and many Thais feel an intense emotional bond to it. The perceived virtues of the late King Bhumibol - modest, capable, conscientious - were a constant popular reference during his long reign to show up the venality and incompetence of ordinary politicians. It is a mantra of the royalist creed, and a preamble of every Thai constitution, that the royal family is kept above politics, beyond criticism.So what was Mr Thaksin thinking, involving the king's elder sister in his party?People close to the former prime minister have let it be known that he had a green light from King Vajiralongkorn, and that the king was persuaded, perhaps by pressure from other family members, to change his mind. But others inside the pro-Thaksin camp believe he simply assumed Princess Ubolratana had her brother's approval, and took a reckless gamble. He has form; his decision to push for a controversial amnesty in 2013, that would have allowed him to return to Thailand, backfired and started the protest movement that led to the 2014 coup.And while some supporters of Thai Raksa Chart and Pheu Thai were excited by the prospect of having a royal celebrity on their side, others criticised it as inconsistent with their long campaign for greater democracy and equality in Thailand.The row over the princess has reignited old rivalries. Royalists have come out to accuse Mr Thaksin of once again trying to exploit the monarchy for his own ambitions. Frustrated supporters of the pro-Thaksin camp, who have been waiting for five years to demonstrate their voting power, fear their side will be tarnished once again as a threat to the monarchy, in order to keep a military-dominated government in power. The battle for Thailand's soulWho is Thaksin Shinawatra?This is now bound to be a more heated election campaign.It has also brought into sharp relief some realities of modern Thai politics. One is that more than 10 years after he fled from Thailand, Mr Thaksin is still a powerful influence on the political dynamics of this country. Two military coups, repeated court cases, the confiscation of his assets and years of demonisation have not finished him off. His parties remain the country's most effective electoral force. In the present climate it is difficult to imagine a reconciliation with his many adversaries, but without one it is hard to see how Thailand can ever move on.Another is the central role of the monarchy. Because of the strict taboos and laws against any critical comment, no journalist writing from Thailand can write freely about this, but some aspects of King Vajiralongkorn's new reign can be mentioned. He is a more hands-on manager of palace affairs than his father, and is overseeing the biggest overhaul of the monarchy in decades. He has taken direct control of the Crown Property Bureau, the wealthiest collection of assets in Thailand, and is overseeing significant changes in the command structure of the armed forces. He has demanded changes to the constitution where they affect the authority of the monarch, and got them. He is taking back control of large properties in the old royal quarter of Bangkok hitherto used by the National Museum, the parliament and the city's zoo. Profile: Thailand's new king It is not clear yet what kind of monarchy he has in mind, but in a country where no-one can be seen to question the king's wishes, he will have a decisive say in the affairs of the nation, and his rule will be very different from his father's. We may never know what transpired between the king, his sister and Mr Thaksin over this extraordinary episode. But we do know that the king's carefully-written statement on Friday night brought it to an immediate halt, and that everyone in Thailand will now be looking to the palace before considering their next steps."

He was detained in Bangkok in November on an Interpol notice requested by Bahrain. He had travelled to the Thai capital on honeymoon.He was sentenced in absentia to 10 years for vandalising a police station.Al-Araibi, 25, denies the charges. Human rights activists say he could face torture if sent back to Bahrain, where he was a vocal critic of the authorities. His case has been taken up by high-profile footballers, with stars including Didier Drogba and Jamie Vardy calling for his release. The Australian government, football's international governing body Fifa and the International Olympic Committee all lobbied Thailand.Thailand's Office of the Attorney General (OAG) asked the court to end proceedings against al-Araibi because Bahrain had said it no longer wanted him, officials told BBC Thai on Monday.""This morning the Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed us that Bahrain was no longer interested in this request,"" OAG foreign office chief Chatchom Akapin said.Al-Araibi is expected to leave Thailand on Monday evening for Australia.Bahrain's foreign ministry said that despite the end of the extradition proceedings, the footballer's conviction still stood.

That ends a bold gambit by the anti-military coalition to boost its popularity and insulate itself against charges of being anti-monarchy, by having the king's flamboyant older sister Ubolratana run for prime minister, although her nomination cannot be legally withdrawn.  Ultra-royalists are now demanding that Thai Raksa Chart be dissolved. That would leave the largest party in the coalition, which is aligned with exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, still contesting the election, but without an important partner. Coalition sources say they believed they had the king's acquiescence for his sister to run in the election. If that is the case, either there was a misunderstanding, or he changed his mind.Hours earlier, Princess Ubolratana defended her decision to run for office.In an Instagram post, she reiterated that she had relinquished all her royal titles and now lived as a commoner.She said she wanted to exercise her rights as an ordinary citizen by offering her candidacy for prime minister. She said she would work with all sincerity and determination for the prosperity of all Thais.Shortly after the king's statement she posted again without addressing the issue directly, simply thanking Thais for their support and saying that she wanted Thailand to ""move forward and become admired and accepted by the international community"".Born in 1951, Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya Sirivadhana Barnavadi is the eldest child of Thailand's late King Bhumibol Adulyadej.

Now King Vajiralongkorn has issued an unusually strong statement censuring the nomination of his sister.The decision to nominate the princess now looks like a grave miscalculation. It will weaken the pro-Shinawatra faction seeking to push the military out of politics, which until now seemed likely to win the largest share of seats in the new parliament.

The submission of King Vajiralongkorn's elder sister as a prime ministerial candidate is one of the strangest, and turns politics on its head.If she is confirmed, it is clear that the strategy of the military faction which led the 2014 coup, in the name both of defending the monarchy and keeping pro-Thaksin forces out of government, is in pieces. The constitution it drafted still gives it lasting influence over future governments. But a royal prime minister could help end the protracted political conflict which has troubled Thailand for the past thirteen years, forcing a reconciliation between the competing factions that the military government failed to bring about. But it would also bring the royal family into the heart of government, undermining the official position that the monarchy stays above politics.

398,'Thai bride' case: DNA tests prompt identity hope,"People who mourned a mystery woman who was buried more than 10 years ago hope new leads in the case will finally provide a name to carve on her grave.The body, thought by police to be that of a ""Thai bride"", was found near Pen-y-ghent in the Yorkshire Dales in 2004.She became known as The Lady of the Hills - the title inscribed on her headstone in Horton-in-Ribblesdale.After a Thai couple claimed to be her parents, locals expressed hope for ""an end to a very sad mystery"".The couple, from Udon Thani in north-east Thailand, said their daughter married a British man in 1991, moved to north-west England and they had not heard from her since 2004.Results of DNA samples taken from the Thai couple, whose daughter is Lamduan Seekanya, are due to be sent to the UK for comparison.Villagers held a funeral for the unidentified woman in 2007 and dedicated an annual ""in loving memory"" service to her each November. Her grave, in the churchyard, currently reads: ""The Lady of the Hills, found 20th Sept 2004. Name not Known, Rest in Peace.""The Reverend Stephen Dawson said: ""We do hope we can replace the plaque with a name if her parents are happy with that and would like to be involved. ""Hopefully by November when we have the next 'in loving memory' service there may be some closure on the case but obviously it's a long-shot at the moment.""Cold-case investigators have said they believe the woman found in the UK was murdered and dumped on the hillside.Sheila Millman, a former parish councillor, said a new plaque with a name ""would be an end to a very sad mystery"".

But if it's really her, I can finally sleep at night.""Cold-case investigators say they believe the woman found in the UK was murdered and dumped on the hillside.Forensic tests suggest she was aged between 25 and 35, originally from south-east Asia and may have lived in north Lancashire or south Cumbria.She was found more than a mile (2km) from the nearest road and was wearing only green jeans, socks and a gold wedding band.Speaking in October, Adam Harland, manager of the North Yorkshire and Cleveland Police cold case review team, said they believed the woman may have been a ""Thai bride"".He said: ""[It is possible] she is a lady who has taken up a relationship with a white gentleman, and come back to the UK.""On Friday, North Yorkshire Police confirmed it had received a possible name for the unknown woman and said inquiries were ongoing."
401,'Thai bride' body found in 2004 on Yorkshire Dales may be relative,"A Thai family believe a woman who is thought to have been murdered and then dumped in a mountain stream in England is their missing relative.The body was found by walkers wrapped around rocks near Pen-y-ghent in the Yorkshire Dales in 2004.Her identity has never been established by North Yorkshire Police but officers think she was a murdered ""Thai bride"".A press conference in north-east Thailand heard a family had come forward about a missing relative.  The Udon Thani Provincial Justice Office was told the woman, who the BBC is not naming for legal reasons, married a British man in 1991 and moved to the north-west of England four years later.Her mother told the Thai Women's Network (TWN), which organised Thursday's press conference, she had not heard from her daughter since 2004.Reporters were shown photographs of the missing woman alongside an artist's impression of the murder victim that was released by police in Britain.The TWN said it had passed on the details of the missing woman, including her name and that of her husband, to North Yorkshire Police, which is investigating the latest development.Cold-case investigators believe the body found in the UK was that of a woman aged between 25 and 35 who was originally from south-east Asia. Forensic tests on samples of her hair led detectives to think she had been living in a rural community in north Lancashire or south Cumbria.She was found more than a mile (2km) from the nearest road and was wearing only green jeans, socks and a gold wedding band.A North Yorkshire Police spokesman confirmed the force's Cold Case Review Unit had received a possible name for the unknown woman.Inquiries were ongoing to establish her identity, he added.As no-one came forward to identify the woman after her body was found, the parish council for Horton in Ribblesdale organised her funeral in 2007.Officials said the village felt ""responsibility"" towards her, and wanted her to have a final resting place ""should her family ever get traced"".More than 40 people attended the funeral in the village graveyard.The headstone bears the title given to the woman by local people - ""The Lady of the Hills""."

She sought help from the US embassy, fearing extradition to Russia.Mr Deripaska has denied the allegations and successfully sued her.He is one of several Russian oligarchs and politicians under American sanctions for ""malign activities"".Ms Rybka's lawyer posted a video on Instagram last week which he said showed her arrest.A woman resembling her and looking sedated struggled as four men pushed her into a wheelchair, then carried her.During her hearing on Saturday, Rybka apologised to Mr Deripaska and said she no longer wanted to ""compromise him.""

403,Mutilated Thai bodies on Mekong shore are activist's aides,"The mutilated bodies of two men found last month in north-east Thailand have been identified as aides of Surachai Sae-Dan, a prominent opponent of the Thai monarchy, police have confirmed.The pair were found by the Mekong river, their faces disfigured and their stomachs stuffed with concrete blocks. They and Mr Surachai were members of a group which fled into exile in Laos in 2014 after Thailand's military coup.All three disappeared on 12 December. Mr Surachai's fate is unknown.The campaign group Human Rights Watch says five Thai government critics who had been living in Laos have gone missing in the past two years.The bodies were found towards the end of December, one of them apparently floating in the river. Both were wrapped in sacks and fish nets tied up with rope.They were identified after DNA tests as Kraidej Luelert and Chatchan Buphawan.Unconfirmed reports say a third body was found at the same time but then lost again.The incident has raised concern among activists about kidnappings by vigilantes or officially sanctioned death squads, though Thai officials have denied any involvement in the disappearances.The country has tried unsuccessfully to extradite a number of activists who fled abroad since the coup.Surachai Sae-Dan, whose real name is Surachai Danwattananusorn, has been an outspoken critic of the Thai military and monarchy since the 1970s.In his late seventies, he has served several prison terms including under the country's strict lese majeste laws for insulting the monarchy.He was jailed most recently in 2012, but given a royal pardon the following year.

Witnesses described seeing gunmen dressed in black arrive on motorbikes before storming the Rattanaupap temple, shooting the monks at close range.No one has claimed Friday's attack, but it took place in Narathiwat province near the border with Malaysia, which for years has seen rebel violence.Muslim separatists there are fighting the Buddhist-majority Thai state.Some 7,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed since the insurgency began in 2004.The violence in the region has resulted in the deaths of at least 23 monks, according to the campaign group Human Rights Watch (HRW).

407,Rahaf Mohammed: Saudi teen says women 'treated like slaves',"A Saudi teenager given asylum in Canada after fleeing her family has said the journey was ""worth the risk"" so she could live a more independent life.Rahaf Mohammed, 18, made headlines when she flew to Thailand and barricaded herself in a hotel while appealing on Twitter for help to avoid deportation.She said she feared being killed if she was sent back to her family.""It's something that is worth the risk I took,"" she told the Toronto Star and CBC News. ""I had nothing to lose.""""We are treated as an object, like a slave,"" she said. ""I wanted to tell people my story and about what happens to Saudi women.""Under Saudi Arabia's guardianship system, women must obtain permission from a male relative to travel outside the country, study abroad on a government scholarship, get married or even leave prison.'I needed consent to leave the house'Arrested for disobeying your father#SaveRahaf: How Twitter saved a Saudi womanMs Mohammed - who has dropped her surname, al-Qunun - alleged that her family had subjected her to physical and psychological abuse.""In the beginning they locked me up for six months after I cut my hair... because it is forbidden in Islam for a woman to dress like a man,"" she told reporters at the office of an immigrant settlement agency in Toronto.""But I was mostly exposed to violence by my mother and my brother,"" she added. ""They were beating me and there was corporal violence.""While she was in Thailand, Ms Mohammed also told the BBC that she had renounced Islam - a crime that is punishable by death in Saudi Arabia.She had been on a trip to Kuwait with her family when she fled on a flight to Bangkok on 5 January, saying she intended to take a connecting flight to Australia and had an Australian visa.But she says her passport was seized by a Saudi diplomat when he met her coming off the flight, leaving her stranded.Ms Mohammed then sent a series of tweets pleading for help from her hotel room.""During this time, I was thinking about what kind of goodbye messages I would write, because I was not going to allow them to take me. I was prepared to end my life before they kidnapped me,"" she told CBC.Her case was picked up by Human Rights Watch and numerous journalists. Thailand eventually allowed her to stay and the UN assessed her claim for asylum.On Tuesday, Ms Mohammed gave a statement to media in Toronto and called herself ""one of the lucky ones"". She said that she wants ""to be independent, travel, make my own decisions on education, a career, or who, and when I should marry"". ""I had no say in all this,"" she said in Arabic. ""Today I proudly say I am capable of making all those decisions."" Last Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that his country would accept Ms Mohammed as a refugee. The following day she was met at Toronto's international airport by Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland.Ms Freeland and her ministry enraged the Saudi government in August when they called for the release of several women's rights activists campaigning for the male guardianship system to be abolished who were detained as part of an apparent crackdown on dissent.  Riyadh responded by freezing all new trade with Canada and expelling its ambassador over its ""interference"" in the kingdom's domestic affairs.The Saudi government has not commented since Ms Qanun's arrival, but the head of the state-funded National Society for Human Rights said on Monday that he had been ""surprised by some countries' incitement of some Saudi female delinquents to rebel against the values of their families"".""I feel very safe in Canada, a country that respects human rights,"" Ms Mohammed said.She added: ""I feel born again from feeling the love coming from everyone waiting for my arrival.""Ms Mohammed said that, although the Canadian weather may take some getting used to, she was excited for the new experiences ahead.""I will try things I haven't tried,"" she said. ""I will learn things I didn't learn. I will explore life.... I will have a job and live a normal life.""Like a typical 18-year-old, one of the first things Ms Mohammed did upon her arrival, after getting clothing appropriate for the Canadian winter, was purchasing a smart phone, an official at the immigrant settlement agency said. The Canadian government offers refugees financial support for up to a year, as well as help with finding housing and registering for federal and provincial programmes, and English lessons.   Mario Calla, executive director with Costi Immigrant Services, which is assisting Ms Mohammed in Canada, said they have temporarily hired a private security guard for the Saudi teen because of the threats she has received on social media. He said that because of the possible risks they are considering settling her - at least for the foreseeable future - with a family to ensure she is not living alone. Her fast-tracked refugee claim has not been received entirely without criticism and Mr Trudeau was asked this week what message it sent to the many other refugee claimants hoping for Canadian asylum. The prime minister said her asylum was granted on a ""specific and precise request"" by the UNHCR, adding ""we know that this is quite an exceptional case but Canada will always be there for people who are in difficulty"". Mr Calla said her case is not without precedent, and that his organisation alone receives about two ""urgent protection"" cases a year. "

A number of countries, including Australia, have considered her case for asylum.Analysis by Jonathan Head, BBC south east Asia correspondentAfter days of speculation that she would move to Australia, Rahaf al-Qunun found herself on a flight in the opposite direction, to Canada. She was seen briefly, being escorted to the departure gate by UN officials. As her plane took off Police General Surachate Hakparn, the immigration chief whose change of heart on Monday allowed her temporary asylum in Thailand, told journalists she had left the country cheerful and grateful to those who looked after her here. Her father and brother, he said, who had come on what turned out to be a futile visit to try to persuade her to return to Saudi Arabia with them, would be leaving Thailand shortly after her.It is only two days since the Australian government announced that it had been approached to take Ms Qunun, and that it would treat her request sympathetically. The UN usually approaches only one country at a time to seek asylum. It is not clear why the Australian option fell through, and the UN switched to Canada. It might be that Australia's tough line towards refugees, and the insistence of its Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton that she would get no special treatment, threatened to slow down the processing of her application.The UN was concerned about her safety, following online threats to her life, and Canada may have been able to process her resettlement more quickly.Renunciation of Islam is punishable by death in Saudi Arabia.Under Saudi Arabia's ""male guardianship system"", a Saudi woman is required to obtain a male relative's approval to apply for a passport, travel outside the country, study abroad on a government scholarship, get married, leave prison, or even exit a shelter for abuse victims.Ms Qunun told the BBC: ""I shared my story and my pictures on social media and my father is so angry because I did this... I can't study and work in my country, so I want to be free and study and work as I want.""She also said she was afraid her family would kill her.Separately, she told AFP she had suffered physical and psychological abuse from her family, including being locked in her room for six months for cutting her hair.A spokesperson for her family told the BBC that they did not wish to comment and all they cared about was the young woman's safety.On Friday, Ms Qunun wrote on Twitter that she had ""some good news and some bad news"", before deleting her account. Her friends said she had received death threats online.Yes. Ms Qunun's case echoes that of another Saudi woman who was in transit to Australia in April 2017.Dina Ali Lasloom, 24, was en route from Kuwait via the Philippines but was taken back to Saudi Arabia from Manila airport by her family.She used a Canadian tourist's phone to send a message, a video of which was posted to Twitter, saying her family would kill her.

410,Rahaf al-Qunun: Unpicking the tweets that may have saved her life,"On the evening of Saturday, 5 January, a desperate situation began to unravel on a newly created Twitter account. Fleeing her Saudi family in Kuwait, Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, 18, sent out a series of tweets pleading for help from an airport hotel room in Bangkok. At the time she had 24 followers. ""I'm the girl who ran away to Thailand. I'm now in real danger because the Saudi embassy is trying to force me to return,"" her first-ever tweet in Arabic read. Then she said something that would be hard to ignore: ""I'm afraid. My family will kill me.""People noticed and the first tweet with the hashtag #SaveRahaf was sent out.Within minutes of that, Egyptian-American activist Mona Eltahawy translated the Arabic tweets into English and sent it to her hundreds of thousands of followers.A few hours later that tweet caught the attention of Human Rights Watch and eventually Phil Robertson, its Bangkok-based Asia deputy director, who sent this out.‏By the early hours of Sunday he was engaged in a direct Twitter message exchange with Ms Mohammed al-Qunun, guiding the young woman in her dealings with authorities at the airport.Despite that she kept up her barrage, live tweeting every minute of her ordeal and putting out videos that showed everything that was happening to her at the airport. Over the course of Sunday, her posts became more and more fevered. The fear and desperation she conveyed through the tweets drew sympathy and support from the Twitter community. Tweets carrying the #SaveRahaf hashtag continued to gain momentum and by mid-Sunday afternoon, it was in more than half a million tweets, according to Twitter. An unknown teenager from Saudi Arabia that no-one had ever heard of had gone from 24 followers to more than 27,000 in the span of less than 24 hours. ""When I heard Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun's public statement that she renounced her religion, I knew things would go very bad for her if she was sent back to Saudi Arabia,"" Human Rights Watch's Phil Robertson told BBC News. ""At that point, there was no question in my mind - she needed our help.""Renouncing Islam, or apostasy, is a crime punishable by death in Saudi Arabia.Arrested for disobeying your fatherSaudi asylum seeker 'forcibly' returned home to familySaudi teen's Twitter campaign for asylum sparks debateThe movement to help Ms Mohammed al-Qunun's life gathered huge momentum, particularly in Australia, where her case is now being referred to for possible resettlement.""Twitter aims to provide a platform where marginalised voices can be seen and heard. This is fundamental to who we are and crucial to the effectiveness of our service,"" an official statement to the BBC read. On Monday morning, the situation took a turn for the worse, with the arrival of Thai immigration authorities at Ms Mohammed al-Qunun's hotel room to deport her to Kuwait.Following their direct message exchange on Twitter, Ms Mohammed al-Qunun heeded the advice of Human Rights Watch not to surrender her mobile phone under any circumstances. And it proved to be a crucial piece of advice. The frantic teenager barricaded herself in with Australian journalist Sophie McNeill, refusing to board the flight. Instead, she relentlessly continued documenting the ordeal on Twitter. After that her followers doubled in number to more than 66,400. The BBC's South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head, who was part of a network of foreign journalists closely charting Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun's case, said the enormous publicity driven by social media was a big factor in what happened to her.""Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun was a frightened, young woman. Interest in Rahaf's plight drove her own Twitter following up by the time Thai authorities planned to deport her on Monday morning. ""This was a very powerful human story happening in real time, whose ending was uncertain.""""In building support and response to crisis situations, Twitter was the perfect social media tool for Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun because it enabled the rapid sharing of information,"" Phil Robertson added. ""The surge of support on Twitter [not only] caught the attention of reporters and editors, it helped engage the mainstream Thai media. ""Her tweets also attracted attention from local diplomats as well as the highest levels of UNHCR and governments to the situation. ""This was all pivotal in prompting Thailand to re-think their approach once it was clear that Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun would not go quietly."" ""As of Sunday night Thai officials were adamant she would be sent back and Thai media had still not reported the story, by Monday morning that had changed,"" said the BBC's Jonathan Head.Today Ms Mohammed al-Qunun is safe, having been declared a legitimate refugee by the UN. Young and social-savvy, Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun was able to take things into her own hands by successfully mobilising a solid online campaign to protect herself. She has come out of this ordeal with 126,000 followers on Twitter in the five days her account has been active.In another case where social media was used in a similar way a Syrian man stranded at a Malaysian airport for months managed to successfully seek asylum in Canada after campaigning for his cause on Twitter and Facebook. But not everyone facing a threat to their life has been as lucky."

Every girl that is tweeting about this, it's either that she has already escaped or she's using a fake account like me. Some people tweeted me or DMed me to tell me to use my real account, for me to be brave. We do not want the guardianship any more. I want to go out of the house and drink coffee from Starbucks. I don't have to take my whole family. This is just way too harsh on us. Living this life is exhausting.Renunciation of Islam is punishable by death in Saudi Arabia.

On Tuesday morning she retweeted her original appeal for asylum, pleading for the UK, Canada, the US or Australia to take her in. Ms Mohammed al-Qunun says she was on a trip to Kuwait with her family when she fled on a flight on 4 January. She was trying to head to Australia via a connecting flight in Bangkok.Because she did not have a visa to enter Thailand, Thai police had denied her entry and were in the process of repatriating her, an official said.She began to live-tweet her ordeal, sharing her Twitter password with friends so they too could assist in spreading the message on social media. But some social media users in her own country strongly criticized her actions. A video showed how she resisted deportation efforts by hiding in an airport hotel room, putting a table against the door to stop people from entering. She told the BBC: ""I shared my story and my pictures on social media and my father is so angry because I did this... I can't study and work in my country, so I want to be free and study and work as I want.""Ms Mohammed al-Qunun has been housed in a secure location in Bangkok since Monday night, when the Thai government allowed her to leave the airport. Her father and brother have arrived in Thailand but she is refusing to see them.  Thailand's immigration chief Surachate Hakparn said the pair would remain there until it was clear where Ms Mohammed al-Qunun would receive asylum.Mr Surachate said the father had denied allegations that the family were abusing her physically and emotionally.""He wanted to make sure that his daughter was safe... he told me that he wanted to take her home,"" he said.Many asylum seekers have tried to reach Australia on boats from Indonesia, often paying large sums to people smugglers.

416,Thailand Pabuk: Thousands emerge from shelter as storm passes,"Thousands of people in southern Thailand are emerging from shelter after the region's worst storm in 30 years passed into the Andaman Sea.Storm Pabuk left Thailand at about midnight GMT on Friday after causing widespread flooding and blackouts. One fisherman died and one is missing.The main tourist islands such as Koh Samui were spared the worst.Flights and ferries are now resuming but tourists face delays due to a backlog of services.The latest information on Tropical Storm Pabuk puts its peak wind speed at about 65km/h (40mph).It passed over the coast of eastern Thailand near the island of Ko Phra Thong at 07:00 local time on Saturday (00:00 GMT), heading towards the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.It left behind a swathe of downed power cables and forced some 30,000 people into evacuation shelters.Warnings of flash floods are still in force.The fisherman died when his boat capsized early on Friday in southern Pattani province, with another crew member still missing.There are unconfirmed reports a man also died when a tree hit his home in Nakhon Si Thammarat.The main tourist islands of Koh Samui, Koh Phangan and Koh Tao were spared the full force of the winds and rain.Koh Samui district chief Kittipop Roddon said: ""There were no casualties, there is some sunshine today and I'm confident some tourists will be able to leave.""Koh Phangan district chief Krikkrai Songthanee said: ""It's all over. All 10,000 tourists are safe... I am relieved.""Thousands of tourists had left before the storm it.Airports and ferry services, closed during the storm, are reopening although some ""red flag"" bans on swimming were still in force.Koh Samui, Nakhon Si Thammarat and Surat Thani airports were resuming operations, with some extra flights allocated but travellers could still face delays.Pabuk made landfall on Friday afternoon in Nakhon Si Thammarat province, leaving about 200,000 people without electricity. Some 30,000 had not been reconnected by Saturday.One resident of Talum Puk, Boonchuay Chuaysri, told Agence France-Presse: ""The roofs on some rooms in my house are gone. The house is filled with mud.""As Pabuk headed out to sea, the Thai Meteorological Department warned ships to keep to shore.""Strong winds are forecast with waves up to 3m-5m high in both the Gulf and in the Andaman Sea,"" it said.The region's last big storm, Typhoon Gay, struck in 1989 and killed hundreds of people."

418,Thailand Pabuk: Tourist islands hit by worst storm in decades,"Tropical storm Pabuk has lashed southern Thailand with wind and rain, in what is expected to be the worst storm to hit the region in 30 years.The storm made landfall at 12:45 local time (05:45 GMT), sending trees crashing down into houses in the province of Nakhon Si Thammarat.It is moving across southern Thailand, affecting popular tourist spots.Thousands of people have left Koh Samui, Koh Tao and Koh Phangan islands but many are riding out the storm.At least two nearby airports on the mainland have been shut and ferry services have been suspended. Tourists stranded on Koh Samui have told the BBC that the island is seeing heavy rain, wind and waves and there have been short power cuts.People also say they have been advised to stay indoors after 16:00 local time until Saturday morning.""I talked to foreigners last night and they are not scared, they understand the situation,"" Krikkrai Songthanee, the district chief of neighbouring Koh Phangan, known for its raucous parties, told the AFP news agency.He said 10,000 tourists were still on the island. The eye of the tropical storm is passing over Nakhon Si Thammarat, to the south, and is expected to weaken into a tropical depression over Surat Thani province. ""But all tourist islands in the Gulf of Thailand including Koh Samui, Koh Phangan, Koh Tao will be affected because Pabuk is huge,"" meteorological department chief Phuwieng Prakhammintara said. One fisherman is reported to have died early on Friday in Pattani province, near the Malaysian border, as waves engulfed his boat.The UK Foreign Office is advising Britons to avoid all but essential travel to provinces near the Thai-Malaysia border.Daniel Moroz, from Bristol, said the situation on Koh Phangan was ""fairly calm"".""It's just persistent rain at the moment but I've been told the worst is coming later. We've been reassured our place is safe and I think by tomorrow afternoon it should have cleared,"" he said. ""What's weird is that the locals aren't too bothered at all as I think the other islands will be hit more than here.""While storms are common in the Gulf of Thailand at this time of year, Pabuk is thought to be the worst in decades to hit during the peak holiday season. In the past, tropical storms have killed hundreds of people but authorities say they are well prepared and able to cope with the expected storm surges of up to five metres.The last big storm, Typhoon Gay, struck in 1989 and killed hundreds of people.Thailand's meteorological department said the storm would affect the south of the country for the next few days and that ""widespread rainfall, and torrential downpours are possible [in] much of the area"".""People should beware of the severe conditions that cause forest runoffs and flash floods,"" the authority warned.The storm will weaken as it crosses over from the Gulf of Thailand to the Andaman Sea, but tourists there are also being warned to be prepared for heavy rain, rough seas and landslides.In Thasala district of Nakhon Si Thammarat, a thousand evacuees had to be relocated to a university gymnasium after the government shelter they were in was damaged by the storm.In the nearby district of Kanom, a businessman told BBC Thai his 1,000-room hotel had to be closed temporarily. He was optimistic that tourists would return after the storm was over."
419,Storm Pabuk: Tourists flee Thai islands after weather warnings,"Thousands of tourists and residents have reportedly fled islands off Thailand's south-east coast to escape an approaching tropical storm. Authorities have also been preparing shelters for those deciding to stay put.Thailand's Met Office says Tropical Storm Pabuk will bring strong winds and 7 metre (22 ft) waves but it is unlikely to become a typhoon.A weather warning has been issued but no evacuation order is in place.The storm is expected hit the country's southern coast from Thursday, causing heavy rainfall and possible flash flooding.Thailand's Defence Minister Prawit Wongsuwan said the military was on alert to assist people affected.Among those areas in the path of the storm is Surat Thani, home to the popular tourist islands of Koh Phangnan, Koh Samui and Koh Tao.Visitor numbers to the islands usually peak over the Christmas and New Year period.""I think the islands are almost empty,"" Krikkrai Songthanee, Koh Phangnan's district chief, told AFP.Images are circulating on social media of tourists and residents leaving various islands by boat for the Thai mainland.However, bans on boats have been enforced in several areas including Kho Phi Phi because of safety concerns. As a result, many tourists have been forced to stay put.Swimming has also been banned in Koh Samui. But videos of people still swimming in the island are circulating on social media.Bangkok Airways said it had cancelled some flights, whilst other airlines said they were monitoring the weather.Authorities on some islands have avoided enforcing bans or advising evacuations altogether.Chaiyan Thurasakul, mayor of the Koh Tao Subdistrict Municipality, told BBC Thai the island had prepared for possible floods, landslides and strong waves. ""If the storm is severe for two to three days, we may have to ask for help from the mainland for shipment of necessary items,"" said Mr Thurasakul. Pabuk - which means giant catfish in Lao - is the first storm in nearly thirty years to hit the region outside monsoon season, which ends around November.In 2011, devastating floods in Thailand killed 600 people and displaced thousands of others in more than a third of the country's provinces.Are you in an area affected by storm Pabuk?

421,New Year Honours 2019: Divers honoured for Thai cave rescue,"A team of British divers have been decorated for their role in rescuing a boys' football team from a Thai cave.Richard Stanton and John Volanthen, who were the first divers to reach the children, have been awarded the George Medal, the second highest civilian gallantry award. Three divers were made MBEs and two others receive the Queen's Gallantry Medal. The dramatic rescue operation gripped the world's attention in the summer.Divers Joshua Bratchley, Lance Corporal Connor Roe and Vernon Unsworth, were appointed MBEs for their role in the rescue, while Christopher Jewell and Jason Mallinson have been given the Queen's Gallantry Medal for exemplary acts of bravery.The Brits behind the Thai cave boys searchHow the Thai boys were rescuedThe Thai cave rescue: What happened next?Palin, Twiggy and Southgate among honoursMr Volanthen told BBC News that while his award was much appreciated, from his perspective as a parent, the most important thing was that the boys were rescued.""I don't think anyone could ask for any greater honour than being able to be a part of the team that returned the Wild Boars [football team] to their families,"" he said. Reacting to the announcement, Mr Unsworth, originally from St Albans but now living in Thailand, said the operation was ""a team effort"" and he was ""honoured to have been recognised"".""For me, after saving the boys, this is the icing on the cake,"" he said.Mr Jewell, from Cheddar, Somerset, who is a diving officer of the British Cave Rescue Council, praised the ""amazing support"" which made the rescue possible. ""Behind every one of the cave divers being honoured is a supporting cast of family, friends, rescue volunteers and employers,"" the 36-year-old said.Mr Bratchley, 27, who is a Met Office meteorologist based at RAF Valley in Anglesey, Wales, used to work for Devon Cave Rescue Organisation.He said to receive such recognition was ""incredible"".Elite divers Mr Stanton, a firefighter in his 50s from Coventry, and Mr Volanthen, an IT consultant in his 40s based in Bristol, are members of the South and Mid Wales Cave Rescue team.Both had experience of previous cave rescues, with Mr Stanton involved in the rescue of trapped British soldiers from a cave in Mexico in 2004.L/Cpl Roe, from Scotland, who is in the Royal Electrical Mechanical Engineers, attached to 21 Signal Regiment, has been caving for more than eight years and cave diving since 2012.Mr Mallinson, 50 from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, dived with Mr Jewell in 2013 to explore the Sistema Huautla in Mexico - the deepest cave in the western hemisphere. The British divers answered a call by Thai authorities to join the search for 12 boys aged 11 to 16 and their football coach, who had disappeared in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave system in Chiang Rai province on 23 June. The boys, who were members of the local Wild Boars youth football team, became trapped after heavy rains caused flooding. The first rescuers reached the group on 3 July but then faced the dangerous task of getting the whole team out safely, with the forecast of heavy rains and the risk of water levels rising. The dangers of the three-day operation were highlighted when a former Thai navy diver died from a lack of oxygen during the mission. The final members of the group emerged on 10 July, prompting celebrations across Thailand and further afield."
422,Two Korean men drown in Thailand golf buggy accident,"Thai police have recovered the bodies of two South Korean men who drowned on Christmas Day after a golf buggy accident.The men were driving in separate buggies with their wives when the vehicles collided at a pier along the Nan river.One man drowned after falling into the water with his wife - the second died after jumping in to save them.Their caddie also fell into the river but was rescued by a local fisherman.Police say the couples were staying at the Si Phirom resort in central Thailand and had attempted to return to the clubhouse after finishing a golf game across the river.The resort uses a floating platform with slings and a pulley to assist with the crossing, according to local press.""Their wives said both were able to swim but I think the cause of drowning was the strong undercurrent,"" a police spokesperson told AFP.The bodies of both men - Jaseoong Ha, 76, and Jun Yong Sung, 68 - have been recovered by police.This story was corrected on 28/12/2018to reflect that both men were driving in separate golf caddies with their wives when the incident took place."
423,Sophie Wilson: Backpacker who broke neck back in UK,"A backpacker who broke her neck diving into a swimming pool in Thailand is back in the UK, thanks to people donating more than £67,000.The money has gone towards Sophie Wilson's hospital bills and a medical flight from Thailand.Insurance company Insure and Go refused to pay out as they said she had acted in a way which put herself at risk.Medics do not know whether the 24-year-old, from Shepshed, Leicestershire, will be able to walk again.Miss Wilson landed at Heathrow on Wednesday and was then taken to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham.Her sister Georgina Wilson said: ""She's feeling so much more positive and happy about being back in the UK and there are no issues with the language barrier.""She's still making good progress every day, so she's getting more and more strength in her arms and hands but there's still no movement from the chest down at the moment.""Sophie Wilson is expected to be in Nottingham for four or five weeks before being moved to a hospital in Sheffield, where she will spend at least six months.""They've said there's a chance she may not walk,"" said her sister.""We've got to play it by ear and take every day as it comes.""The former coffee shop worker had set off on a six-month trip as part of her lifelong dream to travel the world, and had been in Thailand for only a week when she had the accident on 1 December.She thought the pool was deeper than it was and did not see a sign warning that diving was not allowed.Miss Wilson received treatment at a hospital in Chiang Mai and had about 10 hours of surgery.Before leaving Thailand she wrote on Facebook: ""I really am truly amazed by everything that everyone has done for me.""Insure and Go said in a statement: ""We do understand that people go on holiday to have fun and enjoy themselves, but we are not able to cover circumstances where the customer has acted in a way that puts themselves at risk.""This is clearly stated in the policy terms and conditions.""Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

424,The Thai cave rescue: What happened next?,"Throughout this week, we will be looking back at some of the BBC website's most-read stories of the year and asking: what happened after the news moved on?Today, the BBC's South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head returns to Mae Sai in northern Thailand, where members of the Wild Boars football team were rescued from a cave in July.For three weeks in June and July, the fate of 12 young footballers and their coach, and their sensational rescue, made Tham Luang caves the most reported place on Earth.Five months later, it is now one of the most visited spots in northern Thailand.Back in July, a massive pumping operation to lower the water levels inside the caves was sucking out millions of litres an hour, water which cascaded down the hill, flooding the surrounding fruit and vegetable fields.One of them was used by Archawin Mopoaku, an ethnic Akha, one of several hill-tribe minorities living in the area, to grow pineapples. But he did not complain. Instead, he abandoned farming for a while, and volunteered, cutting bamboo to help the army carry supplies up to the cave entrance.Today Archawin's pineapple field lies untilled. And next to it, on the unpaved road climbing up to the caves, he sells oranges from his orchard to tourists, a venture he says is making him a lot more money than his pineapples ever did.""Before the rescue it was very quiet around here"", he said. ""Only once in a while a few foreigners would come up to explore the caves. But after the rescue there are far more people coming, and hill-tribe people like me are doing well.""So are the flower sellers calling out to customers at the entrance to the road, the snack vendors grilling pork, the souvenir stalls and, in particular, the lottery ticket sellers.Exclusive look at the first film of the Thai rescueThe full story of the extraordinary cave rescueWho are the rescued boys?A park ranger sits on a plastic chair under a palm-thatch canopy, keeping a hand-written list of the visitor numbers. That used to be easy. Typically they would get 10 or 20 a day. Now it is more than 6,000.Most of them are Thais, coming from all corners of the country to see where the rescue took place.""Right now, no other tourist attraction in this region can compete with Tham Luang,"" said Damron Puttan, a magazine publisher and TV personality who was visiting. He was travelling in Europe when the story broke in June, he said, and he was struck by how much attention it was getting over there.""I never knew about these caves before the rescue"", said Vanisa Achakulvisut. ""But after all the news about the Wild Boars football team, I had to come and see it for myself.""It isn't just curiosity drawing in the crowds. The mountain range above the caves is named after Nang Non, a mythical princess who killed herself over an illicit love affair, and whose sleeping form the mountain is said to resemble. Caves are traditionally viewed as places of great mystical power in Thailand.There has long been a shrine to Nang Non, next to the cave entrance, where people could make offerings to her spirit. But the seemingly miraculous rescue has enhanced her allure as a bestower of good fortune.The man behind a miracle rescue in ParisWhy US-N Korea ties are worse offEvery visitor I saw came clutching flowers, and said a short prayer at the shrine. It is now a lucky place to buy lottery tickets, and the most popular numbers end in 13, the number of boys and their coach who were trapped in the cave. Now they have another shrine: a three-metre-high bronze statue of Saman Gunan, the Thai diver who died during the rescue.I watched them position it in front of a new, and still empty museum, built in the once mud-filled car park from where we had reported the search and rescue effort earlier this year.The doctor who decided to stay in the caveIn detail: how the boys were savedThe boys, and coach Ekkapol Chantawong, who had helped them endure their 17 days underground by teaching them to meditate, were there as well, only their second visit to the cave since they were brought out.Some of their rescuers had come too. Mikko Paasi, a Finnish diver who helped lay supplies for the final recue, American Josh Morris, who runs a climbing school in Chiang Mai and was a crucial intermediary between the foreign divers and senior Thai officials, and Vern Unsworth, the British caver who has spent years exploring Tham Luang, and one of the first on the scene after the boys went missing.It was a moving reunion; 12 boys, looking fit and cheerful, whose lives, against such tremendous odds, were saved, now hugging their saviours.The Thai government is still very protective of them. They have child welfare officers with them in all their public appearances, and anyone wishing to interview them must go through weeks of rigorous screening by two committees. Their families too have been instructed not to speak without official permission.""For me it's still quite emotional"", Vern Unsworth told me, as we looked at the new green fence now blocking visitors from entering the cave. ""Some people think that to get 13 out of 13 out was a bit of a miracle.""I think the world outside was expecting a bad result. But we never gave up. What the divers did was just an incredible feat of endurance.""No-one should blame the boys or their coach for going in, he said. They were just very unlucky. ""It could have been me."" Vern had planned to go into the caves the day after. The water inside rose very suddenly, after unusually heavy rainfall that day, trapping the boys and coach Ek, and driving them deeper into the caves.Has the experience changed their lives? ""They are an amazing group"", Vern said. ""They have stayed level-headed, they are being well looked after. I wouldn't call it a normal life - they have been on tour around the world. But they are all back at school.""Their head coach Nopparat Kanthawong said they were all training hard after school, just as they were before the rescue. They have regained the weight they lost, he said, although they are still rebuilding their muscle strength. There is plenty of interest from groups keen to help them; we watched a coaching team from Manchester City train them on their hillside football pitch.At least three projects to make feature films based on the rescue are under way. The first, named The Cave, has just finished filming. Vern and the other divers hope the cave site and the museum can be used for public education about the geology, flora and fauna in the surrounding area.For the top official in Mae Sai, district chief Somsak Kanakham, all the additional income and business opportunities from the mini tourist boom at the caves are very welcome, in a poor, largely rural part of Thailand.He does worry, though, about how to keep the momentum going. The area needs better infrastructure to cope with the tide of visitors, and the extra traffic, he said.Longer term, he hopes to get outside advice on how to develop other potential tourist attractions in this pleasant green and mountainous area. At some point all the excitement generated by this extraordinary rescue will start to fade, and with it, perhaps the visitor numbers too. "

It involved a desperate search, selfless volunteers, an audacious rescue, and 12 boys and one man determined to survive against the odds.Several films of the rescue are being planned, but the first to finish filming is The Cave by Thai-Irish director Tom Waller, which involves several of the actual rescue divers.The BBC has been given a sneak peek into the first official photos from the film set.  Waller says that he became inspired to make the film as he watched the Thai cave rescue progress on tenterhooks.""Like everyone else on the planet, I was following the news with much anticipation,"" he told the BBC. ""I realised that as a Thai filmmaker, I was in a unique position to tell this story.""The Cave focuses on the ""volunteer spirit of the rescuers, and the untold personal stories of those involved in the mission"", and is ""embedded in a Thai narrative"", he says. Waller, whose previous work includes the award-winning film The Last Executioner, says more than a dozen participants from the cave rescue agreed to take part and play themselves.""Everyone was extremely enthusiastic about the story, and there was no acting required for these real rescuers,"" he said.""It was like being back at Tham Luang all over again for most of them, reliving the events.""Rescue divers involved include Belgian Jim Warny, Canadian Erik Brown and Tan Xiaolong from China. Others were involved as consultants to help ensure the authenticity of the film, Waller says. Much of the actual cave rescue took part in extremely difficult conditions, a snaking system of water-filled caverns and crevices.This also presented some challenges for the film crew.""It was both a technical and logistical challenge to achieve the underwater scenes successfully,"" Waller says.However, it helped that some of his crew were experienced divers. ""We were able to recreate authentic conditions with the poor visibility and light coming from just from head lamps. It will feel as if you're really immersed in those tunnels with the rescuers.""Meanwhile, for some of the rescuers, being on set in front of cameras may have been the real challenge.Waller says: ""I think the rescue divers found the filming more difficult than actual cave diving!""The majority of the filming was done in locations in Thailand, including Chiang Rai province, although there were also scenes in Ireland, Wales, China, Japan and Hawaii. The crew filmed in a number of caves that they considered suitable to depict Tham Luang cave, says Waller.""We tried to involve the local community as much as possible, and many of the extras travelled long distances to be a part of the production.""His team also requested permission to feature the 12 cave boys in the film but are waiting for a decision from the Ministry of Culture, he says. The Thai government is protective of the boys, and all interviews with them need approval from a government committee.Viewers can expect cameos from some of those involved in the rescue, but there will also be faces familiar to Thai audiences.Veteran actor Nirut Sirijanya, known internationally for his role in The Hangover Part II, is part of the cast, although Waller is keeping his role a secret for now.""Everyone assumed he's playing Governor Narongsak, but he's actually not - he has a small but important role in the film.""The film is due for release on the first anniversary of the rescue in July 2019.All pictures copyright"
426,Thailand approves medicinal cannabis,"Thailand's parliament has voted to approve cannabis for medical use, with a key lawmaker calling it a ""New Year's gift"" to the Thai people. Recreational use will remain illegal.Marijuana was used in Thailand as a traditional medicine, until it was banned in the 1930s. South East Asia has some of the world's toughest penalties for drug usage or possession, and Thailand is the first in the region to allow medicinal marijuana.Why are so many countries now saying cannabis is OK?‘It’s either cannabis or die’Thailand's junta-appointed parliament voted to amend the Narcotic Act of 1979 on Tuesday.It happened after an extra parliamentary session was arranged to push bills through before the New Year's holidays, according to Reuters news agency. The amendment will become law when it is published in the government gazette, The Bangkok Post reported.""This is a New Year's gift from the National Legislative Assembly to the government and the Thai people,"" said Somchai Sawangkarn, chairman of the drafting committee, during the televised session.Consumers will be able to carry specified amounts necessary for medicinal purposes, if they have a prescription or recognised certificate, the Bangkok Post said.  Licences for production and sale of the product will be strictly controlled. The paper said the law also applies to kratom, a South East Asian plant that acts as a stimulant.Across the world, countries have been revisiting their marijuana laws.Canada and Uruguay are among those to have legalised it, including for recreational use.  However South East Asia is known for having very harsh punishments for drugs-related charges.Earlier this year, a man in Malaysia was given a death sentence for selling cannabis oil.Meanwhile, on the Indonesian island of Bali, a British man is facing up to 15 years in prison after being found with cannabis oil which he says he needed for medical reasons. The 45-year-old Pip Holmes, from Cornwall, says he asked a friend to send it to him while he was living in Bali to help his arthritis.Conclusive or substantial evidence that it helps:as treatment for chronic pain in adultsas treatment for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomitingfor improving patient-reported multiple sclerosis spasticity symptomsModerate evidence that it helps:improving sleep in individuals with specific conditions including fibromyalgia and obstructive sleep apnoea syndromeEpilepsyRecent studies have found that cannabidiol (CBD - an active ingredient in cannabis) reduced seizures in individuals with rare childhood epilepsy disorders - Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndromeSources: US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine; New England Journal of Medicine; NHS"

430,Refugee footballer Hakeem Al-Araibi fights extradition to Bahrain,"A Bahraini footballer is facing extradition from Thailand, despite international calls for his release.Hakeem Al-Araibi, 25, who holds refugee status in Australia, was detained in Bangkok last month on an Interpol warrant put out by Bahrain.He was sentenced in Bahrain for vandalism but denies the charges.Australia, football's governing body Fifa and rights groups have condemned his arrest as there are fears for his safety if he is sent back to Bahrain.Mr Al-Araibi claims he will be tortured if extradited. The footballer fled to Australia in 2014 where he was granted political asylum last year and plays for Melbourne football club Pascoe Vale.He was on a holiday in Thailand when authorities detained him at a Bangkok airport on 27 November. On Tuesday he appeared at a Bangkok court where his detention was extended for 60 days. He was denied bail.""I don't want to go back to Bahrain - I want to go back to Australia. I didn't do anything in Bahrain. I'm a refugee in Australia,"" he told reporters as he was led into court.In 2014, Hakeem Al-Araibi was sentenced in absentia in Bahrain to 10 years in prison for vandalising a police station. His home country's embassy in Thailand said on Twitter the footballer was wanted ""for security cases"".The former member of Bahrain's national soccer team denies all allegations. ""If I am deported to Bahrain, don't forget me, and if once I'm there you hear me saying things, don't believe me,"" he wrote on Facebook last week. ""I know what will happen to me and I know I will be tortured to confess things that I have never done.""From mud hut to international goalscorerNairobi to Liverpool: Finding a new life through footballMr Al-Araibi told Human Rights Watch (HRW) that if sent back to Bahrain his life would be in danger and that he had already been tortured there following Arab Spring protests in 2012. He has been a vocal critic of Bahraini authorities and HRW says he is also targeted because of his brother's political activism. Australia says it is in high level diplomatic talks with Thailand, seeking the football player's safe return. Foreign Minister Marise Payne said her country was ""concerned by the ongoing detention of Mr Hakeem Al-Araibi and calls for his immediate return to Australia"".Australia's Football Federation and international governing body Fifa have both also called for his release. Melbourne club Pascoe Vale sent an open letter to the Thai prime minister asking for their player to be protected ""as a recognised refugee in Australia"". ""He should not be forcibly returned to Bahrain, a country from which he has escaped persecution and fears return,"" the letter urges.  The club also posted a video message from the player speaking from his detention cell in Bangkok.Human Rights Watch Asia Director Brad Adams said Thailand needed to realise ""the grave dangers facing"" the football player if returned to Bahrain.Thailand does not have an extradition treaty with Bahrain which would regulate conditions of when and how an alleged criminal could be handed over. Yet even without such a treaty, countries can request a wanted citizen to be extradited. Rights groups though point out that in the current case there are international rules that should bar Bangkok from handing over a person if they might be tortured. HRW's Asia Deputy Director Phil Robertson said on Twitter that warrants like the one used in the current case, ""do NOT apply to recognized #refugees like Hakeem al-Araibi"".London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy warned that Thailand would breach international law if it was to extradite the football player.""Extraditing registered refugees and returning them to territories where they would face a real risk of persecution, torture, or other ill-treatment violates Thailand's obligations under international law, including the UN Convention Against Torture,"" the rights group said in a statement. According to Amnesty International, Thailand in 2014 extradited a 21-year old man to Bahrain in response to an Interpol warrant. Amnesty said there ""are credible reports that he was tortured when he returned to Bahrain""."
431,Thailand election date set and campaign ban lifted,"Thailand's military government has said political parties are free to start campaigning ahead of a long-awaited election scheduled for 24 February.The announcement ends a ban on political campaigning brought in when the military ousted the elected government in a coup four years ago.The military has always insisted it intends to restore democracy in Thailand.But the election date has been pushed back repeatedly. The military took power in Thailand in 2014, overthrowing the government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and the hugely popular Pheu Thai party. Military leaders said at the time they were restoring order after months of political unrest which had at times turned violent. They later drew up a new constitution and changes to the electoral system, which were approved by the public in a referendum in 2017.The constitution effectively ensures that even after the election, the military will remain an influential force in politics. It will be able to appoint the senate, which in turn will help choose the next prime minister.Dozens of people have been detained and charged since the military banned political activity and gatherings of more than five people in an attempt to prevent more of the frequent large scale protests seen over the years. Thailand: Land of military coupsWhy Thais said yes to new constitution But an announcement on Tuesday said political parties ""should be able to campaign to present their policies"" so the junta had ""decided to amend or abolish the laws"".Thailand's military has a history of intervening in politics and has seized power 12 times since the end of the absolute monarchy - and the introduction of the first constitution - in 1932.It has promised not to intervene after the next elections but has already delayed them several times. The BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok says the new electoral system has been drawn up in a way that clearly disadvantages Pheu Thai, the strongest party in the country for two decades. The party remains closely linked to its previous ousted leader, Thaksin Shinawatra, who lives in exile after being convicted of corruption.Much will depend on how well popular support for the party has held up under military rule, says our correspondent. If it does well enough in the election, it may try to form a government, despite likely resistance from the military."

433,Paris driver jailed for taxi scam against Thai tourists,"A Paris court has jailed a fake taxi driver for eight months for demanding that a Thai couple pay €247 (£219; $281) for a trip from the airport. The tourists' video of their argument with him went viral on YouTube. A ride from Roissy Charles de Gaulle airport to central Paris usually costs €45-55.The couple offered to pay him €200 provided he let them out. Identified only as Enock C, the driver was found guilty of fraud and extortion involving threats.In the video he claimed to be working for a private taxi service - known as VTC in French - called Chauffeur Privé. As he insisted on payment of €247 the Thai couple urged him to unlock the rear doors and let them out at a police station.When the Thai man, Charkrid Thanhachartyothin, asked to see his licence the driver showed them a document. But when questioned in court about the taxi fare the driver said ""I know nothing about that, I'm not a taxi.""Le Parisien news website said the VTC drivers' network confirmed that Enock C was not VTC-registered.In the YouTube video the driver got aggressive towards the Thai tourists when they offered him €180. ""You pay me 200 euros!"" he shouted, ""you pay me!""Tonnes of miniature Eiffel Towers seizedParis looks to boost tourist numbersFrance cracks down on Uber serviceIn a post on 9 November under the video Mr Charkrid wrote that ""the fraud taxi attacked on my phone which bumped into my face while I was trying to take a photo"". ""He was driving around while fast while we were calling the police. After an unsuccessful negotiation, and take a lot of time, we are tired and decided to pay him 200 euros to get out. (He locked the door) and we finally can get out.""

But there are also VTC vehicles run by private taxi firms, which have to be booked in advance. The VTC can be a minibus or limousine, and the fare is agreed upon booking. "

436,The farmer in Thailand who became friends with a buffalo,"It's not every day that you come across a man and his BFF - buffalo friend forever.Thai farmer Surat Paewkate was never expecting to form a bond with buffalo Thong Kham when he first became his caretaker.The 34-year-old was paid to take care of the buffalo - but he says it slowly developed into a friendship.""Thong Kham is so sweet and canny,"" he told BBC Thai. ""He loves to walk in my paddy field with me on his back.""So it was only natural that he started to post selfies with his beloved buffalo. His photos quickly went viral, turning him and Thong Kham into instant internet celebrities in Thailand. But the story took another turn when Mr Paewkate revealed that Thong Kham would soon be sold to another owner.It all started two months ago when Mr Paewkate, who lives in the Thai province of Chainat, took up the job of becoming Thong Kham's caretaker. He quickly struck up a friendship with the animal and last week decided to take a couple of selfies with Thong Kham.After a few shots, he noticed that Thong Kham had learned to copy his actions.""Thong Kham started to copy my posture - [he would] look straight into the phone, move closer to me [and] even [start to look like] he was smiling,"" Mr Paewkate said. The dog who gives school another layer of happinessHow animals help this boy's Tourette'sPet selfie takers sought for new studyHe uploaded the photos on Facebook for his friends' amusement, and believes that they shared the pictures on their own profiles. His post was soon shared 32,000 times and requests poured in asking for more photos. ""[People] couldn't get enough of me and Thong Kham, they asked for more pictures,"" he said. ""Some said just looking at the photos [made them] feel much better and [forget about] their hardships from their daily lives.""But this friendship was almost torn apart when Thong Kham's owner - who had been paying Mr Paewkate to take care of him - decided to sell the buffalo to someone else. ""I was quite upset [but] I did not have enough money to buy him,"" said Mr Paewkate, who explained his predicament to his newfound fans. He explained that he would need to raise 100,000 Thai Baht ($3,032, £2368) to buy Thong Kham - and people answered.""Some of them told me... they were willing to donate [money],"" he said. ""So I decided to ask for donations.""Within two days, he raised a total of THB135,969 and closed the crowd funding campaign. In a Facebook post, he asked users to ""make suggestions"" as to what he should do with the remaining funds.According to Mr Paewkate, he will officially become Thong Kham's owner in a ceremony on Thursday. He added that local government officers would be there to maintain transparency, saying he wanted to be accountable to donors. ""I have to thank everyone for this. I will keep Thong Kham happy all his life and post photos regularly. I welcome everyone who wants to visit Thong Kham,"" he said. ""I [used to] dream about having a paddy field, a house and a buffalo I can ride when I go to work in the fields. With Thong Kham, my last dream has come true.""Reporting by the BBC Thai's Busaba Sivasomboon."
437,Garima Arora: Indian chef cooks her way to a Michelin star,"Chef Garima Arora has become the first Indian woman to win a Michelin star for her restaurant Gaa in Bangkok, Thailand. The BBC's Nikita Mandhani spoke to her about the journey to get there.""It's still sinking in,"" says Ms Arora, who only began cooking at the age of 21 when she decided to move to Paris from her hometown Mumbai, to study at the world-famous Cordon Bleu culinary school.""It was nothing like I expected it to be. It was a lot of donkey-work,"" Ms Arora, now 30, says. ""But I just wanted to be there so much and I learnt to cope up and made my way through.""Even though her journey as a chef officially started when she was 21 (she was working as a journalist before that), she says her Punjabi family and their insane love for food meant it was always on the cards. Punjabi cuisine is among the most celebrated in India, and staples like butter chicken and parantha are popular in many other countries. Punjabi people themselves are known for their love of eating and their generosity with food. She says it is this sentiment that also inspires her cooking. ""It's like that feeling of eating at someone's home. We're trying to elevate that experience and make our guests happy.""Garima says her father was one of her earliest cooking influencers. She grew up watching him cook a variety of cuisines in their home, which she says played a huge role in opening up her palate.""He used to make risotto and hummus - imagine in the 90s in India when no one knew what these things were!""Before opening Gaa in April 2017, she worked with several renowned chefs including Gordon Ramsay, René Redzepi and Gaggan Anand.""I think cooking is creatively really satisfying,"" she says. ""Just that act of working with your hands is so calming.""Today, Gaa offers a multitude of dishes inspired by her ""Indian upbringing and international perspective"".What it takes to get a Michelin starShanghai restaurant closes day after getting Michelin star""I'm trying to combine the two to create something that's subtle, beautiful and almost intellectual.""Gaa offers different course meals for its guests using ingredients like unripe jackfruits, pumpkins, crayfish and guavas.Michelin stars, bestowed on restaurants to signify their excellence, are probably the best known awards in the industry.Receiving a star isn't only an accolade - it can also be a boost to the business.Ms Arora says she's proud of her team and her restaurant and wants to continue to focus on Gaa and ""keep doing what we're doing"".As a chef, all she wants her customers to walk away with every day is that ""feeling of never having eaten something like this before""."
438,Are these people really a threat to Thai national security?,"With more than half the population registered as Facebook users, Thailand has one of the highest rates of social media use in the world. The military junta that rules the country has, like other governments in the region, expressed concern about the spread of fake news online.It's adapted draconian laws against computer crimes to impose heavy penalties on those accused of uploading false or distorted information.While the country may return to democracy with an election next year, Thai government critics now risk being accused of ""fake news"" – and having these laws turned against them.Video produced by: Daniel Bull, Thanyarat Doksone, Jonathan Head, Miho TanakaThis story is part of a series by the BBC on disinformation and fake news - a global problem challenging the way we share information and perceive the world around us.

Two of them approached the wall, and one began to spray it.Furlong and Schneider were arrested shortly after at their guesthouse, and taken on a re-enactment, according to Thai police.The other two people shown in the video were not arrested.Chiang Mai is Thailand's fourth-largest city and tourists can visit the historic walled parts of the city."
440,"Thais mourn boxer Anucha Thasako, 13, killed in fight","The death of a 13-year-old boy who was knocked out in a Thai boxing match has led to renewed pressure on Thailand to ban children from boxing bouts.Anucha Thasako was pronounced dead from a brain haemorrhage two days after he fought in the charity match.He had taken part in 170 fights since the age of eight to help raise money for his family, reports say.The Thai parliament is reviewing legislation that would ban children under 12 from boxing matches.Thai boxing, or Muay Thai as it is also called, is hugely popular in the country, where thousands of young fighters and their families see it as a way of earning money.But there are few rules governing the sport and some people oppose proposed laws to protect young fighters, saying they are part of the country's boxing tradition.Many Thais have been saddened by Anucha's death and have been sharing footage of the fight in central Samut Prakan province. A number of prominent boxing stars have sent tributes.Video of the match showed the boy, known by his boxing name Phetmongkol Por Peenapat, and his opponent were not wearing any protective headgear.Anucha was repeatedly punched in the head, before falling to the mat.One newspaper, Thai Rath, quoted the boy's uncle, trainer and guardian Damrong Thasako as saying: ""I want to see a law that requires under-15 boxers to wear protective gear in the fight.""  Others on social media questioned why the referee had not stopped the bout earlier.Anucha's opponent, who is 14, has said he's very sad about what happened and he didn't mean to take another life. He plans to auction the shorts he wore for the match to raise money for Anucha's family.Thailand has more than 10,000 registered boxers under the age of 15, according to figures released last year by its national Sports Authority.A draft law before parliament would ban children under 12 from professional boxing matches, and regulate the participation of young teenagers.""Those aged 12 to 15 will need to be registered, have the permission of their parents and wear protective gear for professional fights,"" Gen Adulyadej Inthapong, vice chairman of the National Legislative Assembly's committee on sports, told Reuters.Some campaigners and medics want the minimum age to be raised to 18 and say change is being delayed because child boxing is so lucrative. The Professional Boxing Association of Thailand wants the age for participation in organised bouts set at 10. Anucha's death comes shortly after Italian boxer Christian Daghio died in a title fight in the country."
441,Norfolk angler John Wilson dies at Thailand home,"A British fisherman once voted ""the greatest angler of all time"" has died at his home in Thailand.John Wilson, 75, who lived in Norfolk, was appointed MBE for services to angling in 2009, writing about 20 books on the subject.He presented Anglia Television's Go Fishing from the 1980s to 2002 after being spotted by TV bosses in his Norfolk tackle shop.A spokesman for ITV Anglia described him as a ""legend, icon, star"".""All over-used descriptions, but John Wilson was truly all three to the world-wide angling community and thousands more who had no interest in fishing whatsoever,"" he said.Broadcaster and producer Bob Ledwidge, who worked with Wilson, said everyone who knew the broadcaster would be devastated by the news.""John was a great guy. What you saw on television - that bubbly enthusiastic personality - was just how he was in person. This is a very sad day,"" he said.Wilson, who had lived in Lenwade in Norfolk before moving to Thailand in 2013, was named the greatest angler by the Angling Times in 2004.Its editor-in-chief Steve Fitzpatrick said: ""His impact on our sport was immeasurable.""He inspired a whole generation, including myself, to pick up a fishing rod and go fishing through his TV shows, books and magazine articles.""The magazine paid tribute to him in a tweet, saying he was ""a man who gave us all incredible fishing memories with his famous Go Fishing series"" who would be ""missed by everyone in the angling world"".In 2013 he appeared on BBC Inside Out East to call for otters to be trapped and moved to other locations with better fish stocks to protect local rivers in Norfolk."
442,Nine Britons rescued from burning yacht off Thai coast,"Nine British tourists have been rescued from their burning yacht after it was struck by lightning off Thailand. They were on board the 50ft (15m) chartered boat off the coast of Phuket when they ran into a tropical storm on Saturday. The group, understood to be from Scotland, sheltered below deck but the yacht was hit by a lightning bolt.A passing fishing boat helped the stricken crew and holidaymakers, and no-one was injured. Video footage showed the Beneteau-manufactured yacht Emmjay engulfed in flames.Police received a mayday call at around 17:00 and coastguards were dispatched to the scene near the Thalang district. Marine chief Wiwat Chitchertwong said all the holidaymakers -  four married couples and another woman - were safely rescued.

This caused a fire.''People were already sheltering downstairs in the boat to shelter from the rain when the lightning struck.''Lt Col Brapan Chanprakon added: ''There were nine passengers on board and assisted by fishing ships they landed safely. There were no injuries or deaths.''The police department is investigating and speaking with witnesses and boat owner.''One couple on board were William and Lilias Tennant, from Lanark in South Lanarkshire.

444,Pride of Britain: Kayak rescuer among Welsh winners,"Four Welsh people, including a boy who rescued his father from icy waters in Anglesey, are to be honoured at the Pride of Britain awards. Joe Rowlands, 14, saved his father Paul from drowning after he passed out from hypothermia when their kayak capsized more than a mile from the coast. Emma Picton-Jones, who set up a mental health charity in Pembrokeshire, is to receive the special recognition award.Two members of the Thai cave rescue team will also receive an award. John Volathen and Rick Stanton, from the South and Mid Wales Cave Rescue Team, dived through a network of underground caves and tunnels to save 12 boys and their football coach who had been trapped in a cave in Thailand for nine days. The awards will be presented on 6 November. Joe Rowlands and his father went for a kayaking trip off the coast of Ynys Dulas, an island off the coast of Anglesey, in February. But when the kayak capsized a mile-and-a-half from shore, Joe and Paul, 51, had to swim to a cluster of rocks - but not before the firefighter passed out from hypothermia. What makes a hero?Courage in a year of terrorThe pair were stranded on the rocks for about two hours before they were rescued by the RNLI, with Paul only surviving because his son performed CPR. ""Without this resource both myself and Joe wouldn't be here today, so I can't thank them enough,"" Mr Rowlands, from Nantwich, Cheshire, said. ""Joe also saved my life that day and was extremely courageous in a life and death situation.""It was a story which captivated the world. In June, 12 boys who played for the same Thai football team and their coach entered a cave network in Chiang Rai in Thailand and became trapped after water levels rose. They were rescued after nine days by a team which included two divers from the South and Mid Wales Cave Rescue Team, based in Brecon, Rick Stanton and John Volathen, who are being honoured with the Outstanding Bravery award.The Brits behind the Thai cave boys searchWho are the Welsh cave rescue team?Finding them was described as a ""moment of euphoria"" by one of the divers, but none of the boys had ever dived before and were trapped about 1.5km below the surface in one of the deepest cave networks in the world. The team of divers carefully brought out each one of the boys to safety through 4km of tunnels as narrow as 30cm (12 in) wide and managed to reunite all of the boys and their coach with their families.In 2016, Emma Picton-Jones's husband Dan took his own life. He had been suffering from depression and anxiety for years. As farmer in rural Pembrokeshire, support services for Dan were limited - despite his job having with one of the highest suicide rates in the UK. In a note, he told his wife ""you couldn't help me but you could help someone else"". In response, Ms Picton-Jones set up the DPJ foundation, raising more than £75,000, allowing her to launch the Share the Load text and phone service in January. She will be honoured with the special recognition award for her contributions to mental health. "

Two of them approach the wall and one begins to spray it. Mr Furlong reportedly told detectives he and his group were drunk and walking back to their guesthouse when he picked up a discarded spray can and used it before his companion.After being indentified the following day, he and Ms Schneider were arrested at their guesthouse and taken on a re-enactment to the Northern gate, one of five historical gates in the city, according to Thai PBS.The other two people shown in the video were not arrested.Chiang Mai is Thailand's fourth-largest city and tourists can visit the historic walled parts of the city.Does bralet boom spell the end of high-rise boobs?Councillor 'teased' with Britney taunts'My husband's cancer lies stole my life'"
448,Thailand vegetarian festival: Swords and other objects used in face-piercing,"Thailand's annual nine-day vegetarian festival kicked off on 8 October with devotees from Loem Hu Thai Su shrine, on the island of Phuket, showing off their eye-catching, some would say alarming, piercing. Warning: Some may find the images upsettingThe religious devotees cut themselves with swords, piercing their cheeks with sharp objects and committing other painful acts to purify themselves and take on the sins of the community.The participants are known locally as ""mah song"", or  ""horses of the gods"".They wear colourful costumes during the macabre ceremony.The festival origins can be traced to a visiting troupe of Chinese performers who fell ill, and practised some of these rituals in order to recover.It is claimed the mah song feel no pain because they are possessed by the purifying spirits of the Nine Emperor Gods, who they believe will protect them from any harm or scarring. They use a variety of items to decorate their piercing including swords, daggers and fish rods.The body mutilation is not the only part of the festival. All Thais must adhere to ritual cleansing activities during this period - including abstaining from alcohol, meat and sex - to ensure good health and peace of mind. The cutting ceremonies take place at the six temples located around Phuket Town.Individuals choose their own objects, and some seem to compete to fit the heaviest, bulkiest or strangest item through their cheeks.Some participants go through less gruesome piercing.Devotees believe the more pain they feel during this event, the more success they will enjoy in the coming year.Pictures from AFP "
449,Thailand: UK millionaire and wife found murdered,"The bodies of a UK millionaire and his Thai wife have been found in northern Thailand nearly a week after what police suspect was a contract killing. The bodies of Alan Hogg, 64, and Nod Suddaen, 64, were discovered buried on their property in Phrae province.Police say Mr Hogg, who was from Edinburgh, was shot dead, while his wife was killed with a hammer.Three suspects have been held. They are alleged to have been hired to carry out the attack by Nod Suddaen's brother.He has now been arrested. ""The motive for the killings was a long-running internal family conflict, feuds and property,"" local police commander Manas Kerdsukho told the AFP news agency.The couple were reported missing last week.The three alleged killers were arrested after police tracked down a pick-up truck said to have been taken from Mr Hogg's property.They later admitted killing Mr Hogg and his wife, police say.The British embassy in Thailand has so far made no public comment on the issue.Mr Hogg moved to Thailand several years ago and had built a luxury villa in Phrae which included a swimming pool and a summer house, reports say."
450,Rescuers save sheep after weeks in hole in Brecon Beacons,"Members of a team which helped rescue 12 boys and their coach from a flooded cave in Thailand have rescued a sheep stuck 25ft underground for three weeks.The mission was launched after hikers reported hearing desperate bleating sounds coming from a hole in the Brecon Beacons on Sunday.A crew from the South and Mid Wales Cave Rescue Team was scrambled, but the weather was too poor.The crew returned on Tuesday and hauled the stricken ram from the hole."
451,Thai cave diver John Volanthen awarded highest Scout honour,"A British diver who was one of the first to reach 12 boys trapped in a Thai cave has been honoured by the Scout Association.John Volanthen, a cub leader from Bristol, was awarded the Bronze Cross for his role in the rescue.The medal is the Scouts' highest honour and is given for ""heroism or action in the face of extraordinary risk"".Mr Volanthen played down his heroics after the rescue in June and claimed he and his colleagues ""are not heroes"".""What we do is very calculating, very calm. It's quite the opposite,"" he added, following the rescue of the boys.But, despite this, he was given the honour at his local Long Ashton club, which included a framed letter from Chief Scout Bear Grylls.Mr Volanthen said he was ""very, very humbled"" because he ""started caving in the scouts, so it's kind of a full circle really"".He added: ""I still take scouts caving, so it's an honour to be given this kind of medal.""The 12 footballers and their coach had wandered into the Tham Luang caves in the Chiang Rai region of Thailand while exploring.Mr Volanthen was the first voice the boys heard after nine days trapped in the underground network.Their rescue was particularly hazardous because the boys, aged 11 to 16, had to swim through tight spaces despite having no previous diving experience."
452,Facebook animal trade exposed in Thailand,"More than 1,500 listings of live animals for sale have been found on Facebook in Thailand by a wildlife trafficking watchdog.Traffic, which monitors such activity, said many of the species, despite having international protection, were not native to the country, and so trading them was unregulated.The listings were found on 12 Facebook groups during one month in 2016. Facebook said it did not allow the trade of endangered species.Among the 200 different species listed for sale were two non-native species banned from international commercial trade - the Eurasian otter and the black spotted turtle.Some of the animals for sale which are banned from international commercial trade are native to Thailand, such as the helmeted hornbill and Siamese crocodile - which are both critically endangered - and the Asiatic black bear. Although only one helmeted hornbill was discovered for sale, Traffic said the critical status of the species meant that any number taken out of wild populations would have ""serious implications"" for its survival.Traffic's findings are to be published this week in a report on the use of Facebook for animal trading in Thailand.The anti-trafficking body analysed membership of the Facebook groups in 2016 and then again two years later. It found that, while two groups had ceased to exist, total membership had almost doubled - up from 106,111 in 2016 to 203,445 in 2018.The adverts included live and dead animals, as well as animal parts in some cases.Thailand's wildlife protection laws did not prohibit the sale of 47% of the advertised species - this was sometimes the case with non-native species.There were 105 species for sale despite protections under Thai law.""Growing online wildlife trade will only pile further pressure on threatened non-native species that currently have no legal protection or regulation,"" said Kanitha Krishnasamy, Traffic's acting regional director in south-east Asia.A spokeswoman for Facebook said: ""Facebook does not allow the sale or trade of endangered species or their parts, and we remove this material as soon as we are aware of it. ""We are committed to working with Traffic and law enforcement authorities to help tackle the illegal online trade of wildlife in Thailand."" Cath Lawson, acting chief adviser for wildlife at conservation charity WWF, said the illegal trade of animals via websites was a growing concern.""The illegal wildlife trade is a serious international crime problem,"" she said.""It takes place in the real world, but also increasingly in digital spaces. ""This is a global problem and needs global solutions, which include increasing law enforcement, raising awareness and reducing demand for wildlife products. "
453,Thai cave rescue: Coach and boys given citizenship,"Thailand has granted citizenship to the coach and three members of a football team dramatically rescued from a flooded cave last month. During their ordeal, it emerged that the boys and their coach were among around 480,000 stateless people living in the south-east Asian country.It prompted calls to fast-track their citizenship applications.The four were part of a 13-strong team, known as the Wild Boars, who became trapped deep in a cave on 23 June.How the Thai boys were rescuedThe full story of Thailand’s extraordinary cave rescueThai boys relive 'moment of miracle' They were found by two British divers nine days later, but it took another six days to rescue the first team members.Coach Ekapol Chantawong, who was widely praised for keeping the boys safe after rain flooded the cave system, was rescued on the 18th day, along with the final three boys.Mr Chantawong and three of the youngsters - who were all reportedly born in Thailand - were handed their citizenship cards in a ceremony on Wednesday.Somsak Kanakam, chief officer of Mae Sai district in Chiang Rai, said they had ""all the qualifications"". However, he told news agency AFP it had nothing to do with the cave incident.Many of Thailand's stateless people are from nomadic hill tribes and other ethnic groups who have lived around the borders of Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and China for centuries.The UN refugee agency believes the group number about 480,000."
454,Thai cave boys leave monastery after novice monkhood,"Most of the Thai boys rescued from a flooded cave have returned home after spending time in a Buddhist monastery as novice monks.Eleven of the Wild Boars youth football team were ordained novices in memory of a diver who died during their rescue.Their 25-year-old coach, who has received monk's orders, will stay on for three months. One of the boys did not participate as he is a Christian.The group were trapped for more than two weeks before a dramatic rescue. The novice monks - aged between 11 and 17 - left a temple in northern Thailand's Mae Sai district after spending nine days living in a monastery, a tradition for males in Thailand who experience adversity.The experience was seen as a ""spiritual cleansing"" for the group, and to fulfil a promise by the families to remember ex-Navy Seal diver, Saman Gunan, who died during the rescue operation.The length of time spent meditating, praying and cleaning their temple - nine days - is a nod to a Thai lucky number.Before meeting their families and friends, the boys received a Buddhist blessing from monks as they asked in unison to leave the temple, each saying: ""I am now a layman.""How the Thai boys were rescuedThe full story of Thailand’s extraordinary cave rescueThai boys relive 'moment of miracle' The extraordinary story of the group's escape from the snaking caverns of the Tham Luang caves of northern Thailand was not just followed in Buddhist-majority Thailand but by millions around the world.The 12 boys and their coach had walked into the caves to explore following a football practice on 23 June - only to be trapped by sudden monsoon floods.They were discovered nine days later by two British divers, having survived on rain water dripping down the cave rocks and meditation led by their coach - already a novice monk - in an attempt to remain calm and use less oxygen.With more rain expected, a risky rescue was attempted. Over three days, expert divers carried the sedated boys and their coach through darkness and submerged passageways towards the exit.They were all released from hospital a week before being ordained, and were said to be in good health.Officials have told media to give time and privacy to the Wild Boars as they adjust back to their normal lives."

456,Moped and quad bike warning for UK tourists,"British tourists are being warned against using mopeds or quad bikes abroad - after a series of accidents and deaths.The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) said holidaymakers should only use quad bikes, which are popular in places such as Cape Verde, Greece and Turkey, as part of organised tours.The group also encouraged tourists to hire cars rather than mopeds.Those who ignored the advice risked ""serious injury"", Abta said.In December 2017, a 23-year-old Northern Irish man had his leg amputated after a moped crash in Thailand.Last month, a 19-year-old from Swindon was killed riding a quad bike in Greece. And in October last year, a 25-year-old woman nearly died in a moped crash in Vietnam.Injured teen stranded in Greece after quad bike crashGeorge Clooney injured in Italian moped crashMan charged over death of his girlfriend in Thai moped accidentUK travel companies reported 36 quad bike accidents and seven moped accidents in 2017 - but Abta said the actual number of incidents was likely to be much higher.In May of last year, a pregnant British woman was killed while riding a scooter with her partner in Thailand.In 2015, an England team badminton player was killed - also in Thailand - when her friend drove their moped into the path of a truck.Abta's Nikki White said many holidaymakers who suffer accidents have ""little experience"" of using the vehicles and are ""unfamiliar with the local roads and driving standards"".As well as risking their physical wellbeing, tourists face being hit with huge financial costs if they have accidents abroad.Ms White said that ""many travel insurance policies"" do not cover activities like quad biking. Lewis Evans, from Thornbury near Bristol, suffered ""devastating injuries"" when he came off a quad bike on the Greek island of Zante in 2016.His family then had to raise £30,000 to bring him home via air ambulance after they discovered his holiday insurance did not cover quad biking.Ms White added: ""We're advising holidaymakers who have little experience on mopeds to think twice before hiring these vehicles, and only ride quad bikes if they are part of a properly supervised off-road excursion."""
457,British backpacker Calvin Hill back home in Ammanford,"A British backpacker who contracted sepsis when he was bitten by a mosquito two months ago has returned home to his family.Calvin Hill, 27, was found by roommates in a hostel, unconscious and ""not breathing properly"", three days before he was due home back in May. He spent 12 weeks in Cambodia and Thailand when travel insurer FlexiCover refused to fly him home.Mr Hill was admitted to the Prince Phillip Hospital in Llanelli this week. His mother Tracey says he is feeling ""a lot better"" now he is home in Ammanford. Mr Hill spent two weeks in a coma, with doctors telling his family to expect the worst.But he came out of the coma at the hospital in Cambodia and regained the ability to move his limbs and talk. Earlier this month, he was transported to Thailand by a medic plane for further treatment. FlexiCover took the decision to fly him to Thailand to avoid putting him at ""unnecessary risk"", because he was unable to make the long flight home at the time. During his time abroad, Mr Hill's family spent more than £8,000 on flights, hotel stays and extending his visa after it ran out.He flew in to Heathrow this week and arrived at the hospital in Llanelli via ambulance in the early hours of Thursday morning.""We are so happy,"" Mrs Hill said. ""After not seeing him for a while, I was thrilled to see how much progress he has made through all his hard work to pull through this terrible ordeal. ""He is doing really well - a lot better."" "

He ended up shooting one of them after a brief confrontation.He told police he had suffered a string of durian robberies in recent days.The farmer has since been charged with murder. Police are now identifying the victim, said local media.The incident took place sometime between late Wednesday night and early Thursday morning in the southern Surat Thani province.The stinky and prickly durian, known as the ""king of fruits"" in several parts of Asia, is highly prized in Thailand."
459,Actor Joe Cole: 'Violent and aggressive? That's not me!',"Joe Cole is someone you probably recognise from Peaky Blinders, after playing a gangster with a flat cap and a Brummie accent for five years.But he didn't want to be known just for playing John Shelby - and so asked to be written out.""The thing about this industry, particularly in the UK I find, is that if you do something well then everyone wants you to do that role,"" he tells the BBC.""People will go, 'He's violent, he's aggressive and that's what he's good at.' And it's like, 'Hang on a minute, that's not me!'""His latest film A Prayer Before Dawn has its share of violence and aggression, but it also sees the 29-year-old trying to show a new side.Based on real life, it follows the story of Billy Moore, a low-level criminal and drug addict from Liverpool who has been in and out of prison and moves to Thailand to start a new life - but ends up back in jail.Prisoners are given a second chance through Muay Thai boxing tournaments and Cole's character has to fight for his freedom.  It's a brutal watch, as the boxer spends most of the film bloody and beaten, but the chance of redemption and a fresh start keeps the viewer hooked.""It's an emotional story and ultimately about a real-life person who was an addict following a journey, and that's what keep you interested,"" Cole says.The actor spent a lot of time with the real Billy Moore, who published his memoir A Prayer Before Dawn: A Nightmare in Thailand in 2014.""I became good friends with Billy, he was a fantastic resource - very open and honest with me, which meant I could fully embody that mentality in the film.""I was shooting Peaky Blinders at the time in Liverpool when I got the role, so we would go for dinner.""I learned a lot about who he is as a man, about his upbringing and how he would react to specific situations, what made him happy and it was fascinating.""Cole describes Moore, who is now back in prison in Liverpool, as a ""complicated dude"".""He had a difficult life and is an addict who struggles with confidence and things like that, but essentially he's a sweet, loving and caring guy who put himself in difficult situations.""Set in a real Thai prison, with a cast of real boxers and ex-prisoners, communication between characters in the film was mostly non-verbal and there was a conscious effort to keep the setting as authentic as possible. Cole says he ""went with an open mind"".He says: ""I was excited and knew all the guys would be largely extras and non-professional actors, prisoner boxers and champion boxers.""There was a transgender character in there too, who wasn't an actress and it was very exciting for me as it was so different to anything I'd done before.""The film was shot much like a documentary, with real sparring and long takes, which was a challenge for Cole as there were no cuts in the edit.He took quite a beating in the film, as you can see from the collection of cuts and bruises that appear on his body.""Everything had to connect, it was almost like a dance with myself and the fighter, so you had to have a certain amount of fighting ability,"" he says.One of the first major roles of Cole's career was as bad boy Luke in series six of Skins, and after John Shelby, Cole says he was worried about being typecast.""Doing something well isn't always more of a blessing than a curse,"" he says.""I know I have range - it's just getting casting directors and producers to give you the opportunities.""  The actor says he relished the chance to play Billy Moore and star in Black Mirror (in the dating episode Hang the DJ), because it would allow him to take on more ""diverse roles"".""As an actor I'm interested in tackling a range of things,"" he says.""It's why I did Black Mirror and then A Prayer Before Dawn. ""Black Mirror came at a really good time and it was a fantastic experience to work with [writer] Charlie Brooker and [actress] Georgina Campbell.""It was really special and a lot of fun. Whereas A Prayer Before Dawn was physically and emotionally demanding, it was good to do Black Mirror afterwards as it was more fun, sweet and playful.""I don't want to just do fighting films or rom-coms, though - I want to do a variety of different things.""A Prayer Before Dawn is in cinemas now and on digital from 30 July.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

461,Thai cave boys ordained in Buddhist ceremony,"Most members of the Thai youth football team rescued from a flooded cave have had their heads shaved as part of a Buddhist ceremony to ordain them as novices.Their coach is also receiving monk's orders. One of the boys is not joining the ceremony as he is a Christian. The group will spend nine days living in a monastery, a tradition for males in Thailand who experience adversity.They were trapped for more than two weeks before a dramatic rescue. The boys were all released from hospital last week and are said to be in good health after their ordeal in the snaking caverns of the Tham Luang caves of northern Thailand. This step is intended to be a ""spiritual cleansing"" for the group, and to fulfil a promise by the families to remember one of the divers who died in the rescue operation. ""They should spend time in a monastery. It's for their protection,"" Seewad Sompiangjai, grandfather of Night, one of the rescued boys told the BBC earlier. ""It's like they died but now have been reborn."" They will stay in different monasteries until 4 August meditating, praying and cleaning their temple. The length of time they will spend doing this - nine days - is a nod to a Thai lucky number.Correspondents say it's seen as normal by Thais for boys and men to spend time as monks as a rite of passage. Who are the boys?The full story of the cave rescueIn pictures: How the rescue unfoldedOne of the boys, Adul Sam-on, will not be joining the rest of the ""Wild Boars"" football team as he is a Christian. Their coach Ekkapol ""Ake"" Chantawong, 25, will join them for the same period of time but as a fully fledged monk rather than a novice. The coach had spent time in a monastery as a novice before this. Although he has attracted some criticism for taking the boys into the cave, he is also credited with helping them through the ordeal by reportedly teaching them meditation techniques to help them stay calm and use as little air as possible.The extraordinary story of the group's rescue has been followed by millions worldwide since 23 June, when they walked into the Tham Luang cave after football practice - only to be trapped by sudden monsoon floods.The 12 boys and their football coach had spent nine days in the cave with little food or light when British divers helping search for them first reached them on 2 July.But with more rain expected, a risky rescue was attempted.  Expert divers guided the boys and their coach through darkness and submerged passageways towards the exit.Each boy was accompanied by a diver who also carried his air supply. The boys were heavily sedated ahead of the rescue to prevent them panicking.The boys and their coach were rescued in three stages over three days.All 13 were transferred to a hospital in Chiang Rai where they received medical and psychological assistance.Hundreds of volunteers, rescue divers and military personnel were involved in the rescue effort. One ex-Thai navy seal diver, Saman Gunan, died during the operation while installing oxygen tanks in the cave.The cave system has now been closed off, but officials have said it could be reopened in future as a tourist attraction."

463,Thai cave: Artists' huge mural honours rescue heroes,"A giant mural entitled The Heroes has been created in Chiang Rai, Thailand, to honour the rescue operation that saved 12 young footballers and their coach, who were trapped in a cave for over a fortnight.The artwork was created by a team of local artists, and prominently features Saman Gunan (seen below), the former Thai Navy SEAL diver who died helping the rescue operation to save the Wild Boars soccer team.The mural is being displayed at Art Bridge, a private gallery in northern Thailand, as part of an exhibition dedicated to the successful rescue operation.Also featured is a statue of Saman Gunan, with the 12 boys and their football coach represented by a wild boar and piglets at his feet.The boys and their football coach became trapped in the Tham Luang cave on 23 June, and were discovered by rescue divers 4km (2.5 miles) from the cave mouth on 2 July. The last of them were finally rescued on 10 July.The mural features some of the rescuers who played major roles in getting the trapped team out alive, including British diver Rick Stanton, seen below.Stanton and fellow British diver John Volanthen (below), were first to reach the boys and their coach after they had been trapped for nine days.Thai cave rescue: Rick Stanton says he is 'not a hero'Mr Stanton told reporters: ""This was completely uncharted, unprecedented territory and nothing like this has been done. So, of course there were doubts.""On his return to the UK, Mr Volanthen told reporters: ""We were very relieved that they were all alive but I think at that point we realised the enormity of the situation and that's perhaps why it took a while to get them all out.""The Brits who helped find the boysBritish diver Vern Unsworth, below, also features on the mural.Fortunately for the rescue effort, Mr Unsworth had explored the Tham Luang cave complex extensively, and lives nearby.In pictures: Thai artists' huge mural of cave rescue heroesAnother British diver on the mural (below) is Robert Charles Harper, who has been caving since 1968.Chiang Rai Governor Narongsak Osotthanakorn, the head of the rescue mission, is also featured - complete with a distinctive cap.Addressing the future of the cave complex, Mr Narongsak said: ""The area will become a living museum, to show how the operation unfolded.""An interactive database will be set up.

465,Thai cave boys: 'This experience makes me stronger',"The 12 boys and their football coach have held a news conference to describe their time trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand.Many offered apologies to their parents, and gave an insight into how the experience had affected them."
466,Thai cave rescue: How the boys were saved,"The Thai cave complex where 12 boys and their football coach became trapped is a snaking system of caverns and crevices which posed a range of problems for rescuers.Some stretches of the Tham Luang cave are more than 10m (33ft) high, while others are a tight squeeze through water-filled passages.The death of an experienced former Thai navy diver, who was part of a team trying to supply the boys' cave with oxygen tanks, emphasised the dangers of the mission.The group of boys and their coach were exploring the caves when a sudden storm caused the passageways to flood, trapping them inside. They had spent nine days in the cave with little food or light when they were discovered on Monday 2 July.Rescuers initially wanted to keep the group supplied underground until the end of the rainy season - which would have taken months.But with the forecast of heavy rains, and the risk of water levels rising, an operation was launched on Sunday, 8 July, to bring them out. Rescue divers with specialist breathing equipment reached the group through a series of water-filled passages. The boys had to be brought out the same way.Sources in the rescue operation, including divers who took part, told the BBC that the boys were heavily sedated ahead of the rescue to prevent them panicking in the dark, tight, underwater passageways.The boys were fitted with full-face breathing masks. For the underwater sections, they were strapped to a rescue diver. The divers were guided through the dark by dive lines. British rescuer John Volanthen, one of those who first discovered the boys, said divers were able to practice rescue techniques with Thai boys from a local swimming club in a pool.""We strapped a cylinder to the front of the child and they had a full-face mask… and essentially we had a handle on the back of the child,"" he saidThe divers were then able to manoeuvre the boys face down along the passageways.""If you want a picture, it was probably more like a shopping bag that sometimes you would hold close to your chest if the passage was narrow and deep. If the passage was low and wide you would hold them out to the side and essentially manoeuvre them around any obstacles that were in the way,"" he said.The boys were clipped to the divers for safety in case they lost sight of them in the murky water.Initial reports suggested each boy was to have two rescue divers - one holding them and one swimming behind - but rescuer Rick Stanton said in the end it was one on one.""We didn't have the personnel to do two on one,"" he told ITV This Morning.The diving option was considered extremely dangerous by some, but dive experts said the priority was to get the boys out before the rains brought more flooding and debris into the cave system.About 40% of the boys' journey through the water involved diving and in other parts the water was up to the rescuers' chests, Thai Navy SEAL commander Rear Admiral Apakorn Yuukongkaew told reporters.After the flooded section, when they reached the divers' operating base the cave, the boys were bundled into stretchers and carried or winched along ropes, according to footage released by the Thai Navy Seals.Each journey back to the entrance took several hours. The rescue mission started on 8 July, with divers entering the cave at 10:00 local time (03:00 GMT). The first boy emerged at 17:40 and by 19:47, three more had followed. The mission was paused overnight for air tanks to be replaced along the route but resumed again on Monday and Tuesday until the remaining boys and their coach were brought out and transferred to hospital.There was a round-the-clock pumping operation to try to clear the caves.But as fast as the water was being pumped out, more was flowing in, fed by sinkholes and streams in the hills above, and the risks from the imminent monsoon rains was high.Mr Narongsak said the mission had been ""a race against the water"".The authorities did try to drill holes in the cave walls to help drain some of the flood water - although the thick rock hampered efforts.There were also suggestions that drilling could be another way to get to the boys and lift them out.But to even begin the process, new roads would have been needed to be built up above the caves to accommodate the heavy drilling equipment needed to break through the rock.A detailed survey of the area would also have had to be done - otherwise there would be little chance of digging a hole in the right place to reach the boys and their coach. Drilling could also destabilise rocks above the children or block passages and increase flooding.The boys, aged between 11 and 17, and their 25-year-old coach had been huddled on a small rock ledge. The environment was wet, so they had to keep warm and dry or risk hypothermia. There were concerns about the level of oxygen in the air in the space where the boys were trapped. Officials said at one point that the level of oxygen in the air had fallen to 15%. The usual level is 21%.Rescuers transferred about 100 oxygen tanks to the cave to help improve the air supply.Thai diver PO Saman had been helping transfer the tanks when he got into difficulties on the way back and did not have enough air himself. He died after losing consciousness in one of the passageways and his colleagues could not revive him.Read more: What to do to survive undergroundHow life in darkness affects humans How will the Thai cave boys cope underground?Much-needed food and medical supplies, including fresh water and paracetamol, reached the boys and their coach on Tuesday. Rescuers transferred supplies to the boys to build up their energy and nutrient levels.Rear Admiral Arpakorn Yuukongkaew, head of the Thai navy's special forces, told reporters they were given ""easy-to-digest, high-energy food with vitamins and minerals, under the supervision of a doctor"".Officials said most of the group were unhurt, although some were weak or had minor injuries. Nine days of hope - images from the searchThailand rejoices as boys foundThe Brits who found the group aliveThe boys had to restrict the use of torches they had with them. Rescue teams took lighting into the chamber and kept the group company as they waited for the rescue operation to begin.Divers also brought letters from the boy's parents to help them handle the strain, and one of the Navy Seals played chess with them to pass the time.""Luckily the coach had the sanity of mind to keep them all together, huddled together to conserve their energy, that basically saved them,"" Ben Reymenants, a Belgian diver who helped with the rescue operation, told AFP news agency.In a press conference after the boys were released from hospital, the boys thanked their rescuers. They paid tribute to the diver who died and said they would say sorry to their parents for going to the cave after telling them they were going to football practice. "
467,Thai cave rescue: What we learned as boys tell of ordeal,"The remarkable rescue of 12 boys and their football coach who were trapped in a flooded cave network in Thailand's Chiang Rai province gripped the world. Speaking in public for the first time since their ordeal, the Thai youngsters looked happy and relaxed as they sat alongside Thai Navy Seals and prepared to share details of how they spent two weeks in darkness underground.The boys appeared in matching football shirts emblazoned with images of wild boars - the name of their team - presented to them by Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn, and answered a set of questions specially selected to avoid causing them distress.Full story: Thailand's extraordinary cave rescueThe doctor who chose to stay in the caveThe team's miraculous story has been widely reported - but it still remained for them to fill in the details. Here's what we learned from Wednesday's press conference.On 23 June, following a football training session, the team's coach Ekkapol ""Ake"" Chantawong said the group had agreed to go ""sightseeing"" and visit the Tham Luang caves for the first time.""We planned to go for an hour,"" he said.Ake said it was not, as earlier reported, to celebrate a birthday - although one of the boys, Peerapat Sompiangjai, known as Night, said he was keen to be home before 17:00 because his parents had prepared a party for his 17th.""We walked normally... [but] after we went into the cave, we knew we were stuck on the way back out,"" Ake said. The group had started to notice pools of water as they made their back way through the tunnels. ""Some asked if we were lost. I said we weren't going in the wrong direction.""Ake said that after realising they were indeed lost, the group walked until they found a dry, sandy spot. ""We stayed near a water source. We slept at this sand spot. Before we slept, we prayed to Buddha. We thought in the morning, water would come down and officials would look for us. We weren't scared at that time.""Between pauses, the group walked around the complex in an attempt to find an exit, while using the flashlight ""sparingly"", Ake said.But as time went on, the boys started to lose their strength.One of the boys described how they drank water as it trickled down the rocks, but said that there was no food to eat.""I fainted. I had no energy and was very hungry. I tried not to think about food because it would make me hungry,"" said Chanin Vibulrungruang. Who are the Thai boys who were trapped in a cave?What to do to survive undergroundAke said they reached a point where they wanted to do more than just wait to be found.""We tried to dig [ourselves] out. We took turns digging at the cave walls. We didn't want to wait around until the authorities found us."" One of the boys said they used stones to dig at the walls. Ake added that contrary to some reports, all of the boys can swim, although some ""aren't strong swimmers"". To help pass the time, the group said they played checkers together. ""It happened in the evening,"" said Adul Sam-on, 14, who described the moment that two British divers discovered them squatting in the flooded chamber as a ""miracle"".""We were sitting on a stone. We heard some people talking. Coach told us to be quiet and listen,"" he said. Adul, the only member of the group who speaks English, said he took the flashlight and rushed down towards the divers, then when they surfaced to talk, ""I said hi"". ""I was stunned because they were English, so I said 'hello'. They asked how are you? So I said I am okay. I asked if they wanted any help. And they said no and told me to go back up. Then he said, how many of you?""Adul said that having already spent nine days in the cave, ""maths and language didn't work in my brain any more"".When asked about the volunteer and former Navy Seal diver, Saman Gunan, who lost his life on 6 July while installing oxygen tanks in the flooded cave complex, Ake said that the whole group was shocked and saddened by the news. ""They felt like they were the reason he had to die and his family had to suffer,"" he said, adding that ""Saman sacrificed his life to save us, so that we could go and live our lives."" Ake said the boys would spend time as novice Buddhist monks to honour the diver's memory. Ex-navy diver dies on oxygen supply missionThe heroes who saved the Wild BoarsThe boys were only told of Saman Gunan's sacrifice on Saturday, when it was determined that they were strong enough to take the news. ""All cried and expressed their condolences by writing messages on a drawing of Lieutenant Commander Saman and observed one minute of silence for him,"" said Jedsada Chokdamrongsuk, permanent secretary at the health ministry.Coach Ake said the plan was discussed in detail with the rescuers and Thai Navy Seals. The group ultimately decided on a risky operation that involved diving through waterlogged passages while the boys were sedated to keep them calm, and then carried out on ""military-grade stretchers"".When asked if the plan had involved bringing the boys out in a certain order, Ake said it hadn't.""They chose to go out voluntary. No weaker or stronger first.""Dr Pak Loharnshoon, a doctor with the Thai Navy who remained with boys in the cave and was also at Wednesday's press conference, said that as all of the boys were healthy enough to be moved, ""any of them could go out first"".Ake said it came down to ""whoever raised their hands first would go out first... some of them didn't want to go because they wanted to stay with the Seals"".Dr Pak said that when the boys were first delivered food in the cave, they found it so delicious that some of them ""snuck food out in wetsuits"".With their press duties now concluded, the boys and their young coach will finally return to their homes on Wednesday night. Psychiatrists have advised their families that the youngsters should not have contact with the media for at least a month."
468,Thai cave rescue boys relive 'moment of miracle',"The 12 boys rescued from a flooded cave in northern Thailand last week have spoken publicly of their ordeal for the first time, describing the ""moment of miracle"" when divers found them.Adul Sam-on, 14, the only member of the group who speaks English, told reporters he could only say ""hello"" when the British divers surfaced.The boys were trapped in the Tham Luang caves for more than two weeks.They left hospital earlier on Wednesday and are on their way home.Five things we learned from news conferenceMusk apology to diver for Twitter attackThe full story of the cave rescueThe 12, who are members of a junior football team, the Wild Boars, appeared in their club's kit at a news conference in Chiang Rai.They were greeted by a banner that read ""Bringing the Wild Boars Home"" on a stage designed to look like a football pitch. The boys sat alongside members of the Thai Navy Seals who helped rescue them.One boy described how they had lived on water from the stones of the cave. ""Water is clean,"" he said. ""Only water, no food.""Chanin ""Titan"" Wibrunrungrueang, 11, said: ""I tried not to think about food because it would make me hungry.""By Howard Johnson, BBC News, Chiang Rai This was a joyous news conference. The first joke was cracked by a Thai Navy Seal diver as he introduced himself: ""My name is Baitoey and I'm the most beautiful in the cave.""The room erupted with laughter. First to speak was Adul, the boy who communicated with the British divers. He said the coach asked him to translate. His reply: ""Chill, I can't understand that quickly!"" Cue more fits of giggles. The boys' friends, family and nurses from Chiang Rai Hospital were smiling and willing them on from the sidelines. A compere kept up a lively patter, making sure no-one was left out. As attention turned to how they became trapped, the mood in the room became more sober. The boys listened attentively as their coach described finding the shelf that kept them safe. When Titan, the youngest of the 12, said he tried not to think of food because it only made him hungry, the others laughed out loud - proof again that even in the worst conditions, these boys have an unbeatable team spirit.The boys went missing on 23 June and were found by divers on 2 July. Navy Seals then brought them food and other supplies.The group described how they bonded with their rescuers over more than a week, until their final rescue. ""We played draughts (checkers),"" Titan said. ""(Navy Seal) Baitoey always won and he was the king of cave.""The team's coach, Ekapol Chantawong, who was rescued with them, paid tribute to Saman Kunan, a former Navy Seal who died during the operation.""We are impressed that Saman sacrificed his life to save us so that we could go and live our lives. Once we heard the news, we were shocked,"" he said. ""We were very sad. We felt like... we caused sadness to his family.""Some boys said they would learn from their ordeal. One promised to be ""more careful and live my life the fullest"". Another said: ""This experience taught me to be more patient and strong.""The boys are due to be ordained as Buddhist monks for a short period of time, a tradition for males in Thailand who have experienced a misfortune.The boys and the coach got trapped when sudden rain blocked their exit from Tham Luang cave, where they had planned to spend only an hour.The heroes who saved the Wild BoarsIn pictures: How the rescue unfoldedNine days passed before the boys were found by two British rescue divers. It was unclear at first how they would be brought out of the flooded cave.But with more rain expected, a risky rescue was attempted. Expert divers guided the boys and their coach through darkness and submerged passageways towards the exit.Each boy was accompanied by a diver who also carried his air supply. The boys were heavily sedated ahead of the rescue to prevent them panicking.The boys and their coach were rescued in three stages over three days.All 13 were transferred to the hospital in Chiang Rai where they received medical and psychological assistance.Who are the boys and their coach?

472,British caver 'could sue' Elon Musk over Twitter attack,"A British cave diver who helped rescue 12 Thai boys from deep within a cave has said he is considering suing tech entrepreneur Elon Musk.In now-deleted tweets, Mr Musk had called Vern Unsworth a ""pedo guy"" after the cave expert ridiculed a mini-submarine built by Mr Musk for the rescue effort as a ""PR stunt"".Mr Unsworth told reporters on Monday that he was considering legal action. ""It's not finished,"" he told Australian network Channel 7.Thailand-based Mr Unsworth's knowledge of the cave complex is said to have played a key role in the rescue effort. He travelled into the caves in the first days after the boys went missing and helped bring in top international cave rescue experts for the mission.Mr Unsworth had earlier said the mini-sub built by Mr Musk's team, and flown to Thailand before being rejected as inappropriate for the rescue mission by Thai officials, would have had ""absolutely no chance of working"".Elon Musk, who regularly takes on journalists and other critics on Twitter, on Sunday tweeted a response to Mr Unsworth, without using his name but calling him a ""British expat guy who lives in Thailand"".Long read: The full story of the extraordinary cave rescueWhy was Elon Musk at the Thai cave rescue?Thai boys' tears for lost rescue diverHe said he would make a video showing the mini-sub making it deep inside the cave ""no problemo"", adding: ""Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it"".Mr Musk did not back down when challenged.He later deleted the tweets - which were sent to his more than 22 million followers - and is yet to publicly respond to the outcry.""Yes,"" Mr Unsworth said when asked if he would consider legal action. The BBC has contacted Mr Musk, via his company Tesla, for comment.All 12 boys and their young coach were rescued last week from the Tham Luang cave system after a complex and treacherous rescue operation involving hundreds of volunteers. They had become trapped in the cave by rising floodwaters on 23 June and were first found by rescuers on 2 July.The 13 rescued remain in hospital in the city of Chiang Rai but are expected to be discharged on Thursday.Last week, as the rescue effort was under way, Mr Musk hit out at the Thai official in charge of the mission's command centre, Narongsak Osotthanakorn, after he said the mini-sub was ""not practical with our mission"", though it was ""technologically sophisticated"".Mr Musk responded by saying Mr Osotthanakorn had been ""described inaccurately as 'rescue chief'"" and was ""not the subject matter expert"".Who are the Thai boys who were trapped in a cave?How the Thai boys were rescuedIn pictures: How dramatic rescue unfolded He also tweeted an earlier email from Richard Stanton - one of two British caving experts called in to front the rescue - who had urged the business leader to build the capsule as quickly as possible.Mr Unsworth told the AFP news agency that he would make a decision on whether he takes legal action against Mr Musk after flying back to the UK this week.""He's just a PR stunt merchant - that's all he is,"" he said."
473,Thai cave rescue: Thai boys' tears for lost rescue diver Saman,"The 12 young footballers who were saved from a Thai cave after an international rescue effort are mourning a former Navy Seal who died in the operation. Volunteer diver Saman Gunan lost his life on 6 July while installing oxygen tanks in the flooded cave complex.He has since been hailed as a hero around the world.The boys and their 25-year-old coach were told of his sacrifice only on Saturday, when doctors decided they were strong enough to process the news.The full story of Thailand’s extraordinary cave rescueThe heroes who saved the Wild BoarsThe doctor who chose to stay in the cave""All cried and expressed their condolences by writing messages on a drawing of Lieutenant Commander Saman and observed one minute of silence for him,"" said Jedsada Chokdamrongsuk, permanent secretary at the health ministry. Photos showed the ""Wild Boars"" football team, who are being monitored in hospital, gathered solemnly around a picture of the diver.""They also thanked him and promised to be good boys,"" the health ministry said.The boys, aged 11-16, were pulled from the cavern by Thai Navy Seals and foreign cave diving experts, in a three-day rescue push that ended on 10 July. They are expected to leave Chiang Rai Prachanukroh Hospital on Thursday, though many are still on antibiotics. They will be watched for signs of psychological distress, which may only become evident in the months to come. The boys have been advised against giving media interviews, which experts say could trigger a post-traumatic reaction.The youngsters and their coach had been invited to the final of the 2018 World Cup by its organiser, Fifa, but had to decline on medical grounds. As the live game will be broadcast quite late on Sunday 15 July (at 22:00 Thai time), doctors said they will enjoy a recording later. The boys' nail-biting tragedy-turned-survival-story has been followed by millions worldwide since 23 June, when they walked into the Tham Luang cave after football practice - only to be trapped by monsoon floods. They had spent nine days in the cave with little food or light when British divers first reached them on Monday 2 July.Scores of volunteers and almost 100 divers joined the effort to free them, which saw the boys sedated and carried out on military stretchers.Some of the specialists have expressed shock that Saman, 38, was the only person killed in the perilous venture.His widow told the BBC: ""He's been praised as a hero because of who he was. He loved helping others, doing charity work and getting things done.""How the Thai boys were savedIn pictures: How the rescue unfoldedAround 4,000 volunteers are working to clean up the area around the now-infamous cave, which was battered by relays of rescuers, volunteers and news crews.While the cave system has been closed, officials have said it could be reopened as a tourist attraction - with strict safeguards to prevent future disasters."
474,The full story of Thailand’s extraordinary cave rescue,"On 23 June, 12 boys went exploring in Thailand's Chiang Rai province with their football coach - and ended up trapped deep inside a cave underneath a mountain.  The BBC's Helier Cheung and Tessa Wong were at the scene as a dramatic rescue bid gripped the world.What happened over those two weeks is a remarkable story of friendship, human endurance - and the lengths some people will go to save someone else's child.Here our reporters tell the full story of the Wild Boars.It all began with a birthday.On Saturday 23 June, Peerapat ""Night"" Sompiangjai turned 17 - a milestone most young people around the world would want to celebrate in style. His family had prepared a bright yellow SpongeBob SquarePants birthday cake and several colourfully wrapped presents at their home in a rural village in Mae Sai district.But Night wasn't rushing home that day. He was out with his friends, the other members of local youth football team the Wild Boars, and their assistant coach, Ekkapol ""Ake"" Chantawong.When their football practice ended, they raced through the rice paddies on their bicycles and up into the forested hills that lately had been blanketed in rain.Their destination: the Tham Luang cave, a favourite haunt for the boys, who loved exploring the nooks and crannies of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai. Once at the mouth of Tham Luang, they stashed their bikes and bags by the cave entrance. The team and their young coach had often ventured deep into Tham Luang, sometimes as far as 8km, for initiation rites where they would write the names of new team members on a cave wall.In high spirits, they clambered into the cave with just their torches. They didn't need much else -  after all, they were only planning to be there for an hour.They would not emerge until two weeks later.Back at Night's home, his family began to worry. His birthday cake sat untouched.Where were the Wild Boars?Snaking for 10km beneath the cloud-swathed mountain range that separates Thailand and Myanmar is Tham Luang, the fourth biggest Thai cave system.Named after a mountain shaped like a reclining woman, its full name is Tham Luang Khun Nam Nang Non - ""the great cave and water source of the sleeping lady mountain"". Rich in folklore, it is a popular destination for day-trippers - and adventurous children.It has its dangers - people have gone missing in Tham Luang before. And once monsoon season starts in July, the cave goes from innocuous to extremely dangerous.The cave can flood up to 5m (16ft) during the rainy season, and should only be entered between November and April.""The water is moving, it's muddy and there is almost no visibility,"" local guide Joshua Morris told the BBC. And once the cave floods - it's risky even for experienced divers.Almost everyone in Mae Sai knows this. So when the parents of the Wild Boars began to worry about their missing boys, they headed straight to the cave. The boys' plans to visit Tham Luang had been discussed in a group chat on a messaging app with other friends.They found the bikes, the bags, and some football shoes outside. They raised the alarm.Deep in the cave, the Wild Boars found themselves in trouble. It had been raining for the last few days, and all that water falling on the mountain had to go somewhere. That somewhere was the Tham Luang cave system, which was fast filling up.One initial account from the boys suggests they were caught off-guard by a flash flood. They needed to get out, but instead had no choice but to scramble even deeper into the cave.The Wild Boars eventually found themselves marooned on a small rocky shelf about 4km from the cave entrance, past a normally dry point known as Pattaya Beach which by now was flooded.Who are the Thai boys who were trapped in a cave?Swallowed up by an unforgiving mountain and surrounded by darkness, the boys and the coach lost all sense of time. Fear, perhaps even terror, would no doubt have crept in.But they were nothing but determined to survive. The group used rocks to dig 5m deeper into the shelf, to create a cavern where they could huddle together and keep warm.Coach Ake, a former monk, taught the boys meditation techniques - to help them stay calm and use as little air as possible - and told them to lie still to conserve their strength.But an extraordinary set of circumstances also worked in their favour.They apparently had no food - but they did have a supply of drinkable water in the form of moisture dripping from the cave walls.It was dark, but they had their torches. There was also enough air for a while - because the porous limestone and cracks in the rocks meant air could come through.They had the right conditions to survive - at least for a little while. And most importantly, the Wild Boars had one another.Now came the hardest bit - hoping for rescue.What to do to survive undergroundOutside the cave, a full-blown rescue operation was quickly unfolding.Authorities called in the elite Thai Navy Seals, the national police, and other rescue teams. Local volunteers also pitched in.Initial investigations found footprints at one of the chambers in the cave - but no other sign the boys were still alive.The Wild Boars were somewhere in the twisted depths of Tham Luang - but where exactly? And more importantly - how could rescuers get to them? Exploring the cave was a challenge - most of the Navy divers had little cave diving experience. And the weather was merciless - heavy rainfall meant the water level was still rising, flooding chambers and cutting off rescuers from parts of the cave.Engineers desperately tried to pump water out of the cave - but struggled, at least at first.At the start, ""no one really had any idea what to do"", one volunteer said. Officials brought whatever equipment they could think of - small water pumps, long pipes, knives and shovels - but much of it was apparently unsuitable.They even tried drilling into the mountainside, desperate to find cracks into the cave system which they could squeeze into, and used drones with thermal sensors to try to locate the boys.Rescuers also turned to the villagers for local knowledge. The Thai Navy Seals found a boy, a Wild Boar member who happened to have skipped the cave expedition. He recalled a place in the complex they'd visited before - called Pattaya Beach. Could the missing 13 be there?Drones, dogs, drilling and desperationAmid the flurry of rescue operations, a small group kept vigil at the mouth of the cave.These were the boys' families, worriedly offering prayers for their lives. Among them was Tum Kantawong, the godmother of Coach Ake.Every day she went up the mountain, carrying fruits, incense and candles. ""It was to show respect to the spirit that protects the cave. I asked her to protect the 13 kids,"" she said.The group gradually expanded to include concerned teachers from the schools the Wild Boars attended. ""We wanted to be the first to welcome the boys when they came out,"" said school administrator Ampin Saenta, who is so close to one boy, Adul, that she calls herself his ""mama-teacher"".Classmates of the Wild Boars held group prayers, sang songs of encouragement into the cave, folded paper cranes, and posted messages of hope on school noticeboards.Villagers rallied together, donating money and hundreds of packages of food to the relatives of the boys and their coach.  'You never imagine someone you know could get trapped'That sense of community soon began to spread, as the story gained the nation's attention. Volunteers from other parts of Thailand flew in, while Thai social media lit up with expressions of love and support.But it was about to get even bigger. The first international rescuers arrived on Thursday 28 June. These were US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries. Some had volunteered, and some were called in by Thai authorities. Others were roped in when it became clear just how monumental the search effort would be.Over the next few days, they and the Thai divers would fight a constant battle with the elements. They had to swim against a strong current, and were often forced back by rising floodwaters.On Sunday 1 July - just over a week after the boys went missing - the rescuers made some progress. They reached a large cavern that would be later dubbed ""chamber three"" and serve as a key base for the divers.It also happened to be the birthday of Note - one of the ""Thai cave boys"", as they were now dubbed by the media. All, however, were still lost to the world.But not for long. The very next day, two British divers made an incredible discovery.John Volanthen and Rick Stanton had been braving Tham Luang's narrow, murky passageways for several days, laying out guide ropes and searching for signs of life.On Monday, the two men finally reached Pattaya Beach. But there was nothing. They continued onwards into the darkness. Then, a few hundred metres further, they found an air pocket.""Wherever there is air space we surface, we shout, we smell,"" John told the BBC. It's a standard procedure for such rescue operations.""We smelt the children before we saw or heard them.""Soon, the light from John's torch illuminated an electrifying sight - the boys emerged from the darkness, coming down the ledge towards him.Rick started counting the boys, while John asked: ""How many of you?""""Thirteen!"" came the reply in English.""Thirteen? Brilliant!""Next to John, Rick couldn't quite believe what he was seeing. ""They're all alive!""The lost Wild Boars had been found.The two divers spent some time with the boys - trying to boost their morale. Then, they left lights with the boys, and promised to return later with food.The extraordinary encounter was recorded on the divers' cameras - and swiftly posted online. The jubilation was instant, and worldwide. Wracked with worry for much of the past week, the Wild Boars' parents were ecstatic to see their children had miraculously survived. They looked thin, but were otherwise in relatively good shape.The boys and their coach were quickly joined by a military medic and Navy SEAL divers who would stay with them for the rest of the ordeal.After nine days in the darkness, the Wild Boars once again saw light. They longed for proper food, and begged for pad krapao, a rice dish with meat stir fried with basil.But doctor's orders were that they be put on a special diet of medicated liquid food, and mineral water with added vitamins.A third boy, Dom, spent his birthday in the cave.Rescuers set to work in figuring out how to extract 13 people -  some of whom couldn't swim - from a winding, flooded 4km-long stretch of caves that even experienced divers would struggle with.""Time is not on our side because they're expecting heavy rains within three days,"" diver Ben Reymenants told the BBC at the time.""Now the real hard work comes.""The astonishing discovery of the children deep in a mountain cave catapulted tiny Mae Sai into the international spotlight.Overnight, journalists from all around the world descended on the district, as even more rescue volunteers from around the world poured in.A small makeshift town mushroomed at the rural country park by the cave entrance. Food stalls were set up - some staffed by members of the Thai royal kitchen - serving free drinks, hot noodles, chicken rice, and even ice lollies.Hope grows at the mouth of a Thai caveNo job was too small to do. The country park toilets were dirty and stretched beyond capacity - so people began cleaning them. Workers needed to get up and down the mountain - so drivers offered free lifts. Rescuers were covered in mud - so a local laundromat cleaned their clothes every night.Spirits were high, but then a fatal accident devastated the community.Former Navy Seal diver Saman Gunan was one of many volunteers who had rushed to help in the rescue.On 6 July, while on a routine run to deliver air tanks to the boys, he lost consciousness after running out of air for himself. His dive buddy pulled him out and tried to revive him.But Saman could not be saved. He was only 38 years old.His funeral took place later that day. Buddhist monks murmured prayers for Saman as incense burned.His wife, Waleeporn Gunan, said: ""Saman once said we never know when we're going to die… so we need to cherish every day."" The death hit home the danger of the rescue mission, and the risks facing the boys. Saman was a fit and healthy diver who had also represented Thailand in triathlons.Ratdao Chantapoon, the mother of cave boy Note, was said to have told a friend: ""The Navy Seal had practised for so long, and was so strong, but also died. How about a boy who has never dived before?""There was another thing to worry about too - despite efforts to replenish the air, oxygen levels in the chamber had fallen to 15%, lower than the usual 21%. Time was running out.Rescuers had identified three possible options:Training the boys to dive through flooded areas of the cave - a process so ripe with potential for disaster it was widely considered a last resortPumping water from the cave and waiting for water levels to recede naturally - but this could take up to four monthsFinding or drilling alternative passages into the caveThe divers started practising with some local boys at a swimming pool - figuring out how to transport a child safely underwater.Other solutions, such as an offer of a kid-sized submarine designed by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk's engineers, would be rejected as unsuitable.The rescue team faced conditions so difficult that even simple tasks - setting up air and phone lines in the cave - seemed impossible at first because of the labyrinthine layout of the cave.Finally, late on 6 July, rescuers set up an oxygen supply. And in the end the boys communicated with their parents the old-fashioned way - by writing letters.The letters, made public by the Thai Navy Seals, were deeply moving.Scrawling hearts and smiley faces on note paper, the boys told their parents again and again that they loved them and not to worry.Letters of love from trapped Thai boysThey listed the food they wanted to eat - fried chicken and pork crackling. One even cracked a joke: ""Teacher, please don't give us too much homework!""""I'm really sorry to the parents,"" said Coach Ake in his letter. But instead of a tongue-lashing, he received only love. ""Coach Ake, I really thank you for taking care of all the kids, and keeping them safe,"" one boy's relative wrote.Sunday 7 July. Two weeks had passed since the boys went missing.Out of the blue, the Thai authorities announced they were pulling out the boys - now.""There is no other day that we are more ready than today,"" Narongsak Osotthanakorn, the head of the rescue operations, said.Journalists and volunteers were asked to leave the cave rescue site - and a brisk, steely mood overtook the camp.Why the snap decision? The rain that had pelted Mae Sai incessantly had petered out in recent days, giving rescuers a rare break.Locals had also told the Thai Navy Seals that by around 10 July every year, the Tham Luang cave system would be completely flooded.It was time to launch what would later be described as a ""superhuman"" rescue effort, one that involved nearly 100 Thai and foreign divers.The journey was split into two sections. The first - from the boys' rocky ledge to chamber three - was more difficult. Rescuers made their way for hours through pitch dark waters that were bone-chilling cold, feeling their way with guide ropes. At times they had to navigate sections so ridiculously narrow that they could only just about fit a body through.Each boy was given a full-face air mask to ensure they could breathe, and clipped to a diver. Another diver accompanied them.A cylinder was strapped to the front of each child, while a handle was attached to their backs - and they were held face down to ensure water would run away from their faces.John, the British rescue diver, likened the equipment to ""a shopping bag"" that allowed them to manoeuvre the boys around obstacles.At the narrow sections, rescuers had to unstrap their air tanks in order to squeeze through, while also pulling along their precious cargo.It would have been terrifying for experienced divers, let alone for children who were not strong swimmers. The Thai government says the boys and the coach were given anti-anxiety medication to relax - but several sources have told the BBC that they were in fact heavily sedated, and only semi-conscious during the journey - to ensure they would not panic.Once they reached chamber three, it was time for the second phase. This took another few hours.Each boy was secured in a stretcher, and carried by a team of at least five men. At one point they had to place the stretcher on a raft and pull it across a chin-high pool of water.Rescuers had to winch the boys up a steep slope using a pulley system. In some rocky areas they formed a human chain, passing the boys hand to hand, while at others they slid them on top of pipes pumping out water.For diver Ivan Karadzic, the experience was extremely stressful. Stationed at a halfway point in the cave, he was responsible for replacing air tanks and guiding rescue divers through.He clearly remembers the nerves he felt when the first boy emerged from the darkness and was brought towards him. ""I didn't know if it was a casualty or a kid,"" he told the BBC. ""But when I saw that he was alive and breathing - it felt very good.""One by one, the Wild Boars were brought out of the darkness of Tham Luang. They were given oxygen before they were swiftly spirited away in ambulances to a hospital in Chiang Rai city.Rescuers took them out in three batches over as many days, as they needed time in between to replenish air tanks.But they were cutting it close. By the time the last batch of boys and the coach were out, water levels were starting to rise again, as rapidly as 30cm in one hour, according to senior Navy SEAL Supachai Tanasansakorn.It was Tuesday 10 July -  the day that locals said the cave would become completely flooded.But while the boys were out, there were still people left on the rocky ledge deep inside Tham Luang - the Navy SEAL divers and medic who had looked after the Wild Boars, as well as Richard Harris, a famed Australian cave diving expert and doctor.They emerged shortly after the last boy was taken out. It was not a moment too soon, as a pump suddenly stopped working - some said it failed while others said it was switched off.Floodwaters rushed in, sending workers clearing up the site fleeing.It was an astonishing feat - after two agonising weeks the Thai cave boys and their coach were finally out at last, safe and sound. On Facebook, the Thai Navy Seals posted: ""We are not sure if this is a miracle, science, or what.""In Chiang Rai, jubilant crowds lined the streets leading to the hospital, cheering on the ambulances. Car horns blared incessantly in celebration.Thai social media was inundated with posts hashtagged #ThankYou, #Heroes and #Hooyah, the signature Thai Navy Seal chant. All around the world, millions of people who had anxiously followed the story celebrated the return of the Wild Boars.But it was a bittersweet night for one person - Richard Harris. The selfless doctor who cut short his holiday in Thailand to save the boys' lives received the terrible news that his father had just died.The doctor who chose to stay in the caveDressed in gowns and wearing face masks, the Thai cave boys sat up in their hospital beds and waved to the world.On Wednesday 11 July, the media got its first post-rescue glimpse of the Wild Boars in a Thai Navy Seals video. Some made victory signs at the camera.Their parents, who had waited so very long to hold their sons again, were not by their side. They were behind a viewing window, some sobbing with joy at the sight of their boys.The government said it was necessary to quarantine the boys to protect them and others from infection - though this did not stop Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha from visiting in person. The parents did not publicly object to the strict rules.At the hospital, the boys and coach were put through a series of health checks. Eye shades were a must at first - their eyes, accustomed to two weeks of darkness, could not bear the light.Hospital authorities said that some had minor lung and eye infections and needed antibiotics. Apart from that, they appeared to be on the mend. Eventually, parents were finally allowed to briefly see the boys, although they had to maintain a 2m distance, and don hospital gowns and masks.Some of the boys have even been able to start eating normal food again, after days of craving chocolate and their favourite snacks.As for the rescuers, they are still digesting the unprecedented feat they pulled off.""We didn't think the mission would be this successful,"" said Thai Navy Seals leader Rear Adm Arpakorn Yuukongkaew.When rescue operations began, his team only had ""a little bit of hope that they might still be alive"".""In the end that tiny bit of hope became reality.""Many had expected the story of the lost Wild Boars to end in tragedy. Instead, it became a story of hope and survival, and of parents and sons reunited. It's a story of ordinary people from all over the world coming together in a remote town in northern Thailand with one mission: to save 12 young boys and their coach.""If you could do the same for someone else's child, you would,"" John told reporters upon his return to the UK.What's next for Mae Sai? The district, and Tham Luang cave, have been put on the global map, probably permanently.Already, local officials are planning to convert the cave complex into a museum and tourist attraction - and, inevitably, at least two production companies are eyeing the Hollywood potential of the story and angling to turn the rescue mission into a film.As for the Wild Boars and Coach Ake, plans are afoot for them to shave their heads and spend a few days in a monastery. Their families believe this Thai Buddhist tradition will bless their lives, and cleanse them of an unfortunate experience.""It's for their protection,"" said Night's grandfather, Seewad Sompiangjai. ""It's like they have died [after going into the cave] - and now have been reborn.""For the boys, and Coach Ake - their first priority once they leave hospital must surely be to spend time with their families again.After all, Night still has to celebrate that 17th birthday - and his parents have promised him a party.Additional reporting by BBC News and BBC Thai staff in Chiang Rai, and BBC Bristol.

475,Thai cave rescue: Rick Stanton says he is 'not a hero',"A British diver who helped to save 12 boys and their football coach from a flooded cave in Thailand has insisted he was not a hero.Rick Stanton, from Coventry, said he was using a ""very unique skill set"" to ""give something back to the community"".He and other divers who aided in the rescue returned to Heathrow on Friday morning.Mr Stanton and John Volanthen were the first to reach the group, which had been trapped for nine days.How the boys were savedThe heroes of the Thai cave rescueKey questions of cave rescueHow would you survive in a cave?The pair are both members of the South and Mid Wales Cave Rescue Team.Mr Stanton told reporters: ""This was completely uncharted, unprecedented territory and nothing like this has been done. So, of course there were doubts.""I knew that we had a good team, with good support from the Thai authorities, the caving community and rescue organisations, so we had the best we could do to make a plan work.""Mr Stanton was asked how he felt when he first saw the boys alive in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave.He said: ""Initially of course excitement, relief that they were still alive. ""As they were coming down the slope we were counting them until we got to 13, unbelievable.""We gave them a little bit of extra light, they still had light, they looked in good health. Then of course when we departed, all we could think about was how we were going to get them out. ""So, there was relief, tempered with uncertainty.""Returning with Mr Stanton were fellow divers Chris Jewell and Connor Roe, both from Somerset, Josh Bratchley from Devon, Jim Warny from Co Clare, Mike Clayton from Shropshire and Gary Mitchell from Machynlleth in Powys.Mr Jewell said: ""The diving conditions were extremely challenging, there was poor visibility and responsibility for another human being's life.""It was a successful outcome and we played a part in an international effort.""Mr Jewell said it was very hard to judge how close it came to being a very different outcome.""The Thai authorities took a lot of steps to divert rivers on the mountain top which we believe bought us a lot of time to get this outcome,"" he said.Mr Stanton would not describe how his team rescued the children, describing it as ""too detailed for this point in time"".But he said: ""The most important thing to have was a full face mask which had been applied inside with positive pressure to enable them to breathe and to be relaxed enough so not to feel any anxiety during the process.""There was a lot of chaos but we were so task-orientated, focused and we blanked that out and carried on with the job in hand, step by step, until we achieved success.""Mr Stanton declined to answer any medical questions but said: ""They were carefully handled.""There is a lot of responsibility, that is all I am prepared to say... there is a lot of responsibility that an experienced diver could handle."""
476,Cave rescue: Key questions answered,"After 17 days underground, all the Thai boys and their football coach have safely escaped from the Tham Luang cave complex.A team of Thai and international divers mounted a dangerous and complicated rescue to bring the boys out, and details of the bid are still emerging now.BBC correspondent Jonathan Head has answered some of the core questions about the boys, the rescue attempt, and what happens next.We will not know that until we hear from them and their assistant coach, Ekkapol ""Ake"" Chantawong. On that Saturday they were scheduled to play a match, which was cancelled, according to head coach Nopparat Kanthawong. He scheduled a training session instead. The boys were keen cyclists so on the Facebook chat group through which they communicated with the parents, coach Ake suggested they cycle to the football field. There was no suggestion there that they would go on to the caves. Saturday was the 16th birthday of Pheeraphat 'Night' Sompiengjai, and a local shop said the boys spent more than 700 baht (US$22) on food to celebrate, a large sum in this area. Coach Nop describes Ake as being very kind-hearted and devoted to the boys. He thinks the boys persuaded him to go with them into the caves. The caves are well-known in the area and had been explored by the boys before. The best guess is they went quite deep, which is easy when they are dry, got caught by rising flood water, and were forced to go even deeper.The official explanation is they are weak from their ordeal and potentially vulnerable to infection. These are now very precious lives in Thailand. A massive effort has been made to get them out alive. The Thai authorities are taking no chances. Perhaps they also wanted to avoid the excitement of seeing their parents again. Thais are generally less physical than westerners. Hugging is unusual. And the parents are from poor, marginal communities, used to being told what to do by officials, and probably grateful for the lengths the government went to in rescuing them. They would not protest. They were allowed to see them through windows, and are gradually being allowed in, wearing gloves and facemasks, to stand in the same room.At this stage that seems unlikely. The parents say they have forgiven him, and they are grateful for the efforts he is reported to have made to keep their spirits up in the caves, in particular through meditation, which he learned during 12 years as a monk. Meet the Thai boys who were trapped in a caveHow did the boys survive underground?Coach Nop said Ake may be asked to go back to being a monk for a while, something Thais typically do as a kind of penance, or to replenish or cleanse themselves spiritually. Such a move would make a lot of sense to Thais, and he would likely be allowed to resume life as normal after that. Also Thailand typically does not have a 'blame culture', where a culprit must be found for any misadventure. There is a more fatalistic acceptance of things going wrong, less public clamour for accountability.The boys were in the caves nine days before they were found. They may have had a little food from what they bought to celebrate Night's birthday. They are passionate football players, very fit, and with the training they have had a tight-knit team. This would have helped them ration their food carefully and support each other, perhaps with songs. Coach Ake taught them to meditate, say Thai navy divers, and gave them more food than he ate. He also told them to drink water dripping from the rocks, rather than polluted ground water. During their last six to eight days they were being fed, initially high-protein gels, but later more normal food, which might have allowed them to start putting on a little weight before coming out.Most of the time. They went in with cheap torches, which would not have lasted long. It is likely they were in the dark for most of the first nine days of their ordeal. Once they were found a Thai army doctor and at least three divers stayed with them, equipped with good torches. Even so they were mostly in the dark, and had to wear sunglasses when they were first brought out.The Thai authorities are being very coy about this. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said they had been lightly sedated. But the BBC has spoken to a number of people involved in the operation who say the boys were heavily sedated, and only semi-conscious. The logic for this would be the fear their rescuers had that they would panic when wearing diving equipment for the first time in darkness and swirling cave water, endangering the lives of all of them.The two British cave divers who led the rescue effort, John Volanthen and Richard Stanton, are believed to have asked for Australian Richard Harris, a cave diver and anaesthetician, to assist in preparing the boys. How the Thai boys were rescuedThe heroes who saved the Wild BoarsHow they carried semi-conscious or very drowsy boys through the technically challenging early stages of the journey out, with a lot of diving in narrow passages, we do not know. At times they may have been strapped to a diver's body. Later they were strapped on to a stretcher and suspended from a rope pulley system attached to the cave roof. The entire operation was complex, innovative and very bold. Nothing like it has been attempted before. Some of those involved described the tasks undertaken by the core divers, who carried the boys out, as superhuman. The Thai government, for most of it. It is likely that the contribution by other countries, like the 30 US air force personnel who went to help, would have been funded by their own governments as a gesture of good will. Many Thai businesses supported with transport and food. Thai Airways and Bangkok Airways offered free flights to some of the foreign divers coming in.No, and few countries could. Cave diving is a very specialised skill, and expert cave rescuers are even rarer. Thailand was fortunate that an experienced caver Vern Unsworth has explored the Tham Luang cave complex extensively, and lives nearby. He was on the scene the day after the boys disappeared, and suggested that the Thai government needed to invite expert divers from other countries to help. The Brits behind the Thai cave boys searchAs it happened - Thai cave rescueThe Thai navy divers who went down initially struggled, because both their experience and equipment were for sea diving, which is very different. They were driven out of the caves by rapidly rising flood water, and finding the boys seemed a hopeless cause. Once foreign divers arrived, from many different countries, the Thai authorities allowed them to devise first the search, and then the enormously complex rescue. It was a huge logistical operation involving hundreds of people, building guide rope and pulley systems, putting in power and communication cables. It is to Thailand's credit that it was organised so well, and there was no attempt to diminish the foreign contribution. Since we published this Q&A, we have received many more questions from readers about the rescue. The BBC's Jason Boswell and Howard Johnson have answered some of them.On the evening the boys went missing, Nopparat Khanthavong, another coach of the Wild Boars team, began receiving phone calls from worried parents. He called the missing coach, Ekapol Chanthawong, and some of the boys, but there was no answer. Eventually he got hold of Songpol Kanthawong, a 13-year-old member of the team whose mother picked him up after training.The boy told him that his teammates had gone to explore the Tham Luang caves. Coach Khanthavong then raised the alarm. Cave divers will always put in a reference, or guide, line when they first swim into a cave. The line is unspooled from a reel as they extend further into the cave and will be tied off on rocks at regular intervals. The divers can then follow this line in and out of the cave or use it to install additional stronger lines or ropes so they can hold on and navigate despite terrible visibility. Even if they lost their masks they can navigate by touch and feel along the rope.What the head of the Thai rescue operation actually said was that the mini-submarine provided by Elon Musk was not ""practical"" with the mission. The exact reason why wasn't given.Several expert cave divers told the BBC that one of the potential problems with the design put forward by Mr Musk's team might have been that the ""submarine"" is a rigid inflexible tube.Cave passages are often not straight and smooth, so if there was a bend it may have been difficult for divers to try navigate the tube.Imagine trying to manoeuvre a long couch into a small room through an even smaller door, but in the dark and with a limited air supply. Why was Elon Musk at the Thai cave rescue?The divers would have wanted every piece of equipment as streamlined and as flexible as possible to navigate the uneven walls and bends of cave passages.However the mini-sub may be of future use in places that are not as restricted - for example in sunken or capsized ships. Experts say the design should continue to be worked on as the mini-sub may be valuable under a different set of circumstances.Mr Musk responded to the Thai authorities by tweeting an email from one of the British caving experts who played a key role in the rescue urging the inventor to build the capsule as quickly as possible.Mr Musk also said that ""SpaceX engineering is absolutely certain that mini-sub can do entire journey & demonstrate at any time""."

478,Thailand cave rescue Brit diver says: 'We are not heroes',"A British diver who helped save 12 schoolboys and their football coach from a flooded cave in Thailand says he and other rescuers ""are not heroes"".John Volanthen was the first voice the boys heard after nine days trapped in the underground network in Chiang Rai province.This week, after an 18-day ordeal, they were all rescued from the cave complex.Arriving at Heathrow Airport on Thursday, Mr Volanthen said it was a ""relief"" but played down his heroics.Mr Volanthen, an IT consultant based in Bristol but who grew up in Brighton, was one of the first rescuers to discover the group huddled in the darkness of the Luang Nang Non Cave.The heroes who saved the Wild BoarsCave rescue: The operation in pictures Arriving back in the UK, he said everybody had ""pulled together"" and was ""very, very pleased it worked out quite so well"".""We're just very happy that the boys are out and safe,"" he said.""We were very relieved that they were all alive but I think at that point we realised the enormity of the situation and that's perhaps why it took a while to get them all out.""On social media, Mr Volanthen has been described as a ""real hero"" with many calling for him and fellow Briton Rick Stanton to be honoured.But Mr Volanthen dismissed the idea, adding: ""We are not heroes. What we do is very calculating, very calm. It's quite the opposite.""""We take it one step at a time and hopefully, as we've managed to in this case, we come up with the results.""Mr Volanthen also paid tribute to Thai navy diver Saman Kunan, who died while replenishing oxygen canisters, saying his death was an ""absolute tragedy"" and brought a ""bittersweet"" taste to an otherwise ""excellent"" operation.The diver, who is in his 40s, and Mr Stanton, a fireman from Coventry who is in his 50s, reached the group nine days after they went missing deep within the labyrinth.How the Thai boys were rescuedKey questions on Thai cave rescueThe final four boys and their 25-year-old coach were brought to safety on Tuesday, having entered the network for exploration on June 23 before it became flooded by monsoon rains.Their rescue was particularly treacherous because the boys, aged 11 to 16, had to swim through tight spaces despite having no previous diving experience."
479,Thailand cave: Museum and film in the works for Tham Luang,"The cave complex in northern Thailand where 12 boys and their football coach were trapped for more than two weeks is set to be turned into a museum.Rescue officials said the museum would showcase how the operation unfolded, predicting it would be a ""major attraction"" for Thailand.At least two companies are also looking to make a film telling the story of the rescue.The rescued group are all now recovering in hospital.How the Thai boys were rescuedWho are the Wild Boars?Video has been released showing them in good health and in good spirits, though they will stay in quarantine for a week. The Thai Navy Seals have also published dramatic footage of the operation itself, showing how expert divers navigated the Wild Boar football team through the perilous journey to the surface.On Thursday, the Navy Seals were given flower garlands and an enthusiastic welcome as they arrived at a military airport south of the capital, Bangkok. The Tham Luang cave is one of the largest cave systems in Thailand. It lies under the mountains around the small town of Mae Sai, in northern Chiang Rai province on the border with Myanmar. The area is largely undeveloped with only limited tourism facilities. ""The area will become a living museum, to show how the operation unfolded,"" Narongsak Osottanakorn, the former governor and head of the rescue mission, told a news conference. ""An interactive data base will be set up. It will become another major attraction for Thailand.""However, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has said precautions will have to be implemented both inside and outside the cave to safeguard tourists.It is not clear if the museum will be operational all year round, as Thailand is prone to heavy floods during the monsoon season, which lasts from June until October. It was the sudden onset of that rainy season that trapped the boys deep underground while they were exploring. Two production companies are racing to turn the extraordinary story into a film.Even before all 13 people had been brought out, US studio Pure Flix - which makes inspirational Christian films - had announced its producers were on the ground interviewing rescue workers,Key questions on Thai cave rescueThe heroes who saved the Wild BoarsStudio co-founder Michael Scott, who lives in Thailand, said his wife had grown up with Saman Gunan, the former Thai Navy Seal member who lost his life during the mission. ""To see all that heroic bravery in the cave, and to get all the divers out, it's just such a touching event and so personal to me,"" he said in a video on Twitter, filmed at the rescue site. But according to Los Angeles-based Ivanhoe Pictures, they have been officially picked by the Thai government and navy to develop the film.The doctor who chose to stay in the caveUS media quoted the company as saying the film would be directed by Jon M Chu. He last partnered with Ivanhoe in directing the forthcoming romantic comedy Crazy Rich Asians.Concerns are already being raised on social media that any film would focus more on the international characters while downplaying the role of Thais. Chu insisted on Twitter that his film would be fair.The 12 boys and their coach first made their way into the cave on 23 June but found themselves trapped after heavy rains caused it to flood.They were found by British divers after nine days and eventually rescued in an operation that involved dozens of divers and hundreds of other rescue workers.

480,Thailand cave rescue: First footage emerges of boys in hospital,"The first footage has emerged from the hospital where 12 Thai boys and their coach are being treated after their dramatic rescue from a flooded cave.Several boys can be seen in facemasks and hospital gowns, at least one giving a peace sign for the camera.Meanwhile, reports say the boys and the coach were sedated to stop them panicking during the dangerous rescue.The Thai Navy Seals also released new video showing the three-day rescue operation that captivated the world.Divers who took part in the operation said the boys were heavily sedated to avoid anxiety as they went through the dark, narrow, underwater passageways.Former Navy seal Chaiyananta Peeranarong told AFP news agency: ""Some of them were asleep, and some of them were wiggling their fingers, kind of groggy - but they were breathing. My job was to transfer them along.""Each boy was strapped to one of two rescue divers tasked with shepherding him, and bundled onto stretchers to be carried through the dry parts.Earlier on Wednesday, the head of the Thai Navy Seals told the BBC that ""hope became reality"" with the rescue of the boys and their coach from the Tham Luang cave.""We had a little bit of hope that they might still be alive but we had to do it, we just had to move forward,"" Rear Adm Arpakorn Yuukongkaew said. ""There was only a tiny bit of hope, but that's all we had to work with.""The group was trapped in the cave by rising water and rescued in a dramatic operation that captivated the world. The complex, three-day rescue saw four boys emerge on Sunday, four on Monday, and the final four boys plus their coach on Tuesday. They survived the nine days before they were found by drinking water dripping from the cave walls, officials said.The doctor who stayed with the boysHeroes who saved the Wild BoarsFootball teams offer support to rescued boysThe boys lost on average 2kg (4.4lb) during their ordeal but are said to be in good physical condition. They will remain in hospital in the nearby city of Chiang Rai for a week, followed by a week's recuperation at home.The first four boys have already been visited by their families, officials said, and the others will be allowed to receive visitors soon.Joy and relief as Thai cave boys rescuedHow the Thai boys were rescuedHeroic diver gave his life to the rescueThere were cheers around the cave as the dozens of divers and hundreds of other rescue workers involved in the operation left the site.In Chiang Rai, the news was greeted by the honking of car horns while people gathered outside the hospital broke into applause.On social media, Thais showed their feelings about the rescuers by using hashtags including #Heroes and #Thankyou. Offers of hospitality for the boys, the coach and their rescuers have come in from international football clubs including Manchester United and Benfica.Aged between about 11 and 17, the members of the Wild Boars football team entered the cave system in dry weather, during an excursion with their coach. The group was cut off on 23 June after heavy rains flooded the cave complex.The story of the rescue - told for childrenThey were huddled in darkness on a ledge when they were found by British divers.Elation at the discovery of the group quickly turned to concern as it became clear how difficult it would be to rescue boys who could not swim and had been weakened by their time underground.Getting to and from the chamber where the group were trapped was an exhausting round trip even for experienced divers. The process involved a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes.The boys and their coach were trapped underground for a total of 17 days. They reportedly entered the cave to celebrate one of the team's birthday, and the snacks they brought with them are thought to have helped sustain them.Once found, they were given ""easy-to-digest, high-energy food with vitamins and minerals, under the supervision of a doctor"", said Rear Adm Arpakorn Yuukongkaew.Authorities said they seemed to cope well with the mental strain of their time underground. Rescue teams brought them lights and letters from their parents to help them cope.Their coach, Ekapol Chantawong, reportedly taught the team how to meditate to cope with the stress.

There were conflicting reports following the rescue about the extent to which the boys had been medicated before they were brought out. The Thai prime minister on Tuesday denied reports that they had been sedated, saying the boys were given only light anti-anxiety medication commonly provided to soldiers.But sources in the rescue operation told the BBC that the boys were heavily sedated and only partially conscious, and had to be carried throughout the journey out of the cave.All of the boys lost weight during their ordeal and will remain in hospital for a week, followed by a week's recuperation for another week at home. Public health ministry officials said the first group were all eating normal food and the second group would be put on normal food as of Wednesday.

""All the 13 Wild Boars are now out of the cave.""There were cheers around the Tham Luang cave system as the dozens of divers and hundreds of other rescue workers involved in the operation left the site. In the nearby city of Chiang Rai, the news was greeted by the honking of car horns while people gathered outside the hospital broke into applause.On social media, Thais showed their feelings about the rescuers by using hashtags including #Heroes and #Thankyou. Offers of hospitality for the boys, the coach and their rescuers have come in from international football clubs including Manchester United and Benfica.Aged between about 11 and 17, the members of the Wild Boars football team entered the cave system in dry weather, during an excursion with their coach. The group was cut off on 23 June after heavy rains flooded way the cave complex, blocking their way back out.The story of the rescue - told for childrenThey were found nine days later when two expert British divers entered the cave. The boys were huddled in darkness on a ledge.Elation at the discovery of the group quickly turned to concern as it became clear just how difficult it would be to rescue boys who could not swim and had been weakened by their time underground.A team of expert divers guided the boys and their coach through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the cave system. Getting to and from the trapped group was an exhausting round trip, even for experienced divers. The process involved a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes.Wearing full-face masks, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy was accompanied by two divers, who also carried his air supply. The boys and their coach were trapped underground for a total of 17 days. Officials said the group survived the first nine days of their ordeal by drinking water dripping from the cave walls.They reportedly entered the cave to celebrate one of the team's birthday, and the snacks they brought with them are thought to have helped sustain them. Once found, they were given ""easy-to-digest, high-energy food with vitamins and minerals, under the supervision of a doctor"", said Rear Admiral Arpakorn Yuukongkaew.According to Thongchai Lertwilairattanapong, an inspector for Thailand's health department, all the children lost on average 2kg during their time underground, but are in good physical condition.Authorities also said they seemed to cope well with the mental strain of their time underground. Rescue teams brought them lights and letters from their parents to help them cope. And their coach, Ekapol Chantawong, reportedly taught the team how to meditate to cope with the stress.

484,Cave rescue: How did the Thai boys survive underground?,"The 12 Thai boys and their football coach have finally been rescued after 17 days underground. Their ordeal captured the world's attention, as divers successfully brought them out of the flooded Tham Luang cave complex.But before they were found, the group had to survive for nine days in the darkness unaware of the desperate search efforts.Dripping water, birthday snacks and meditation all helped keep the team alive until divers eventually reached them.Joy and relief as Thai cave boys rescuedHow the boys were savedWho are the Thai boys who were trapped in a cave?The team originally entered the cave complex when celebrating one of the boy's birthdays. Peerapat Sompiangjai, nicknamed Night, turned 17 on 23 June, the day the team went missing.The other boys reportedly banded together to buy snacks for his birthday, and it is thought these snacks helped sustain them after getting trapped in the caves. Their coach, Ekapol Chantawong, reportedly refused to eat any of this food so the boys would have more for themselves, leaving him the weakest when divers eventually found the team on 2 July.What to do to survive undergroundOnce found, they were given ""easy-to-digest, high-energy food with vitamins and minerals, under the supervision of a doctor,"" according to Rear Admiral Arpakorn Yuukongkaew, head of the Thai Navy Seals.But until then, the birthday snacks were all the boys had for food.Authorities also said the group had relied on water dripping from the cave walls for survival.Remarkably, doctors who have treated the rescued boys say they are in good health after their ordeal.""They are in good condition and not stressed,"" said Thongchai Lertwilairattanapong, an inspector for Thailand's health department. ""Most of the boys lost an average of 2 kg.""Hypothermia can often be a risk underground, especially in caves which have flooded.Speaking to the BBC, the retired head of the British Caving Association Andy Eavis said ""the ambient temperatures will be fairly high"" in cave complexes in that part of the world.Nevertheless, the team took precautions. Rear Adm. Arpakorn Yuukongkaew told the BBC that as he understood, the team had used rocks to dig five metres deeper into the cave ""to create a tunnel so that they could keep warm"".While the boys were trapped deep underground, air was not initially a concern.""Most caves naturally breathe,"" says Anmar Mirza, national co-ordinator of the US National Cave Rescue Commission. ""Air can get in and out where people can't.""However, as the days went on, oxygen levels dipped to about 15% where the team were huddled. The usual level is 21%.Former Thai navy diver Saman Gunan died while helping to bring through more air tanks for the boys. The heroes who saved the Wild BoarsThe doctor who chose to stay in the caveOf far greater concern was the group's mental health.The team had to handle the total darkness of the cave, without any awareness of time or of the massive search efforts to find them.The efforts of their coach, nicknamed Ake, may have been instrumental in keeping them calm.Formerly a Buddhist monk before turning to football, Ake taught the boys meditation to help them handle the stress.Rear Adm. Arpakorn Yuukongkaew said Ake had used these meditation techniques to calm the boys, but also to make sure they used ""as little air as possible"" in the cave.When the rescuers managed to get through to the team, they delivered letters from their families and took notes back to allow them communication with the outside world.In his letter, Ake apologised to the parents for taking the boys into the cave network, but several replied to say they did not blame him.""I promise I will take care of the kids as best as I can,"" he wrote."
485,Cave rescue: Who are the 12 boys and their coach who were trapped in Thailand?,"On 23 June, 12 boys and their football coach walked into a cave after football practice in northern Thailand. The boys, who are part of the Moo Pa - or Wild Boars - football team, became trapped when heavy rains flooded the Tham Luang cave and cut off their escape route. All 12 boys and their coach have been freed from the cave. Few details about the group have been released. Here is what we know about the boys and their coach: Chanin Vibulrungruang (Nickname: Titan), 11The youngest in the team, who played as a forward. Titan started playing football at age seven before joining his school's sports club. He was later invited to join the Wild Boars football club.Panumas Sangdee (Nickname: Mig), 13  According to Nopparat Kantawong, the head coach of the football team, Mig is bigger than other kids his age, but he is agile. He is a defender for the Wild Boars.Duganpet Promtep (Nickname: Dom), 13 Striker, and captain of the Wild Boars, Dom has reportedly been scouted by several professional clubs in Thailand.He is said to be a motivator and respected by his team for his football skills. ""Players on the field need a captain like this because sometimes the coach can't get in to solve their problems,"" Nopparat told the BBC. How risky is the Thai boys rescue?The cave rescue as it happenedThe Brits who helped find the boysAdul Sam-on, 14 Adul was born in Myanmar's self-governing Wa State and left his family behind to get a better education in Thailand, according to reports.The left defender speaks Thai, Burmese, Chinese and English, and was the only one able to communicate with the British divers when the group was first discovered.Boys and parents send letters of loveWhile trapped in the cave, the boys and their relatives exchanged letters, carried by the rescue divers. Adul told his parents he missed them and not to worry. ""Mum and Dad want to see your face,"" his parents wrote. ""Mum and Dad pray for you and your friends, so we can see each other soon.""Adul is also a talented volleyball player - and part of a local team that came second in all of northern Thailand two years in a row, local teacher Bunjob Chai-arm told the BBC.Somepong Jaiwong (Nickname: Pong), 13 ""Pong is a cheerful boy, he likes football, and every sport. He dreams of becoming a footballer for the Thai national team,"" his teacher Manutsanun Kuntun told AFP.The left winger wrote to his parents from inside the cave, saying: ""I love Dad and Mum. Don't worry about me, I'm safe."" His parents replied: ""Take good care of yourself and be strong - Dad, Mum and everyone are waiting for you.""Mongkol Booneiam (Nickname: Mark), 12 or 13 Mark has been described by his teacher as a ""very respectful"" boy.""He's cheerful, energetic, very friendly, and likes football and volleyball,"" Bunjob Chai-arm told the BBC.Mark and his mother had moved to Thailand from Myanmar, he added. He plays in the same volleyball team as Adul. His father Thinnakorn Boonpiem told AFP that his son is a ""good boy"" who loves to study - almost as much as football.Nattawut Takamrong (Nickname: Tern), 14In a letter to his parents, Tern told them not to worry about him. The defender wrote that he missed his parents and grandparents, but ""Tern can take care of myself"".""Dad and mum are not angry at you and do not blame you,"" his parents replied, adding that they were waiting for him ""in front of the cave.""Peerapat Sompiangjai (Nickname: Night), 17Night plays as right winger on the team.He went missing on his birthday and his parents say they are still waiting to hold his party.According to reports, the boys went into the cave to celebrate Night's birthday. They were said to have brought treats and snacks along with them.These supplies probably helped sustain the group in the many days spent trapped inside the cave. Sittthisak Sawanrak, who goes to the same cycling club as Night, describes him as ""a great lad who just loves to cycle and play football"".""He's a quiet boy - doesn't talk much, but a very good, polite boy,"" he told the BBC.In a letter to his parents from the cave, Night wrote: ""Night loves everyone"" and drew several hearts. Ekarat Wongsukchan (Nickname: Bew), 14 Bew is the goalkeeper of the team. In a letter to his mother, Bew promised to help her sell things at her shop once he was rescued.Prajak Sutham (Nickname: Note), 15Note has been described by family friends as a ""smart, quiet guy who loves sport and supports Chiang Rai United"". Family friend Ponrawee Tachavandee told the BBC he was ""shocked"" when he learned Note was trapped. ""I didn't expect he would go inside the cave.""Rinlinee Sombat, who works in the same garage as Note's father, describes him as  a kind boy who takes care of his two-year-old sister, and enjoys playing with her young son.""He's a smart kid - when you teach him how to fix something in the garage, he'll learn how to do it after just one go,"" she told the BBC.Pipat Pho (Nickname: Nick), 15 In his letter, Nick told his parents he wants to go for Mookatha, or Thai barbeque, when he comes out of the cave. ""Nick loves Mum, Dad and siblings,"" he wrote, alongside a drawing of a heart.Pornchai Kamluang (Nickname: Tee), 16Tee is a defender for the Wild Boars. ""Don't worry, I'm very happy"", said Tee in a letter to his parents. Assistant coach Ekapol Chantawong (Nickname: Ake), 25Ake was reportedly born in Myanmar and lost his parents at a young age. Before becoming a football coach, he spent several years as a Buddhist monk, and learnt how to conserve energy by restricting movements and meditating. According to local news reports, he taught these techniques to the boys in the cave.In his letter, Ake apologised to the parents for taking the boys into the cave network, but several replied to say they did not blame him. ""I promise I will take care of the kids as best as I can,"" Ake wrote.Some media reports suggest that when the group was found Ake was the weakest, having refused to eat any of the food they had brought with them, giving it instead to the boys.His note also included a message to both his aunt and grandmother, informing them that he was ""fine"". ""Do not worry too much about me. Take good care of your health,"" he wrote, adding: ""Please prepare vegetable juice and pork rind for me. I'll have them when I can get out. Thanks."""
486,Thailand cave rescue: Diver from UK says outcome is 'wonderful',"A diver from Essex who helped alongside the successful cave rescue in Thailand has welcomed the ""wonderful"" news.Tim Ashton was called to assist the British diving team in a three-day mission to save 12 boys and their coach from the Tham Luang cave."
487,Cave rescue: The divers who got the Thai boys out,"The rescuers who worked to save the group trapped in a Thai cave were a mix of international divers collaborating with Thai navy Seals. The 12 boys and their football coach were first found by British divers but the effort to get them out was a truly global operation. Several Thai navy divers took part in the rescue. One ex-navy diver, Saman Gunan, died in the cave last Friday.Little information has been released about exactly who was involved and how, largely because most participants have been reluctant to talk.It is thought that dozens of divers - Thai and foreign - were part of the efforts. Here are just some of them:Numerous Thai special forces were part of the rescue efforts. Most notable are a doctor - widely identified as Pak Loharnshoon - and three yet-to-be-named divers who volunteered to stay by the boys' side after they were found underground a week ago.Dr Pak is seen applying medicine to a boy's minor wounds in a video shared by the Thai navy Seals Facebook page last week.Four Thai Navy Seals personnel were the last to leave the cave on Tuesday evening.The Navy Seals unit was led by Rear Admiral Arpakorn Yuukongkaew.When divers were still trying to find the boys, he was the one updating reporters on the slow progress being made. Briton John Volanthen's voice was the first the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground. He and fellow British diver Mr Stanton were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.The trio arrived in Thailand three days after the football team went missing.Mr Volanthen, an IT consultant, and Mr Stanton, a former firefighter, are part of the South and Mid Wales Cave Rescue Team.They have participated in a number of cave diving rescue operations, including in Norway, France and Mexico.The cave divers who went back for their friendsDr Harris, from Adelaide in Australia, has decades of diving experience. He was the one who examined the boys in the cave and gave the green light so the rescue operation could go ahead. Had the boys been too weak, a rescue attempt by diving out would have been too dangerous. According to media reports, Dr Harris has taken part in cave diving explorations in Australia, China, Christmas Island and New Zealand. A anaesthetist by training, he has also been specialising in expedition medicine and retrieval operations.In 2011, he recovered the body of his friend, experienced cave diver Agnes Milowka, who ran out of air during an extremely difficult expedition in South Australia.It is thought that his assistance in the Thai rescue was specifically requested by the British divers.The doctor who stayed with the boysPetty Officer Saman Gunan, 38, was a retired Thai navy diver who volunteered in the rescue efforts. He lost consciousness on his way out of the Tham Luang cave complex, where he had been delivering air tanks on 6 July.His dive partner tried to revive him but could not, and his body was brought out of the cave.His widow told the BBC: ""He's been praised as a hero because of who he was. He loved helping others, doing charity work and getting things done.""Rear Adm Arphakorn said he would not let PO Gunan's ""life be in vain."" ""We will not let the sacrifice of our friend go to waste."" Belgian Ben Reymenants runs a dive shop in Phuket. He is thought to be part of the group that first found the boys on the Monday. Claus Rasmussen is a Danish national who has been living for years in Thailand, working for several different dive schools. He is currently an instructor working with Ben Reymenants' company, Blue Label Diving. He has been diving across Asia and also worked in several other countries in South East Asia.Finnish national Mikko Paasi is the founder of a diving centre on the small Thai island of Koh Tao, where he specialises in technical diving. That means he focuses on wreck and cave diving.On 2 July, the day the boys and their coach were found, Mikko's wife said on Facebook she bought her husband's flight to Chiang Rai to join the rescue efforts on what was their eighth wedding anniversary.  Ivan Karadzic, a Dane, moved to Koh Tao a few years after Mr Paasi, and they now run the diving centre together.He told the BBC about his fear on seeing the first boy and a diver approach him from a distance - not knowing if it was a ""casualty or kid"" - and then his relief on realising the boy was safe.On Mr Gunan's death in the run up to the final rescue efforts, Mr Karadzic wrote on his Facebook wall: ""Rest in peace. You are a hero and we will never forget your sacrifice.""Canadian national Erik Brown is a technical diving instructor from Vancouver. He began diving over a decade ago and co-founded Team Blue Immersion, a technical diving school in Egypt.On Tuesday night, he wrote on Facebook that he had done seven diving missions in nine days, which accumulated to 63 hours inside the Tham Luang caves."

489,Cave rescue: The Australian diving doctor who stayed with the boys,"It was his rare combination of talents that led Australian doctor Richard Harris deep into the Tham Luang cave in Thailand.When the Wild Boars football team was located deep inside the cave, after being missing for a week, the Adelaide anaesthetist abandoned his holiday in Thailand and volunteered to help.He went in to assess the boys' health and stayed with them for three days. It was under his direction that the weakest boys were first led out with the others successfully following in the complex operation. Dr Harris, known as Harry, is believed to have been one of the last rescuers out of the cave.The heroes who saved the Wild Boars'How the operation unfoldedThe rescue in picturesSeventeen days in darknessBut relief and celebration were suddenly cut short by personal tragedy - on Wednesday it emerged that Dr Harris's father had died shortly after the rescue's finish.His employer, South Australia's ambulance service, said his family's grief had been ""magnified"" by the physical and emotional demands of the rescue operation.""It has been a tumultuous week with highs and lows,"" Dr Andrew Pearce from MedSTAR said, asking for privacy.""Harry is a quiet and kind man who did not think twice about offering his support on this mission.""Dr Harris was specifically identified by British divers and requested by the ""highest levels"" of the Thai government to join the rescue, according to the Australian government.""He was an integral part of the rescue attempt,"" said Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop who added that the doctor was internationally renowned for his cave rescue expertise.""[The Australians] have been a big help, especially the doctor,"" the leader of the rescue mission, acting Chiang Rai governor Narongsak Osotanakorn told an Australian Nine News reporter on Wednesday.""Very good. The very best,"" he said in reference to Dr Harris.His friend Sue Crowe told the BBC the doctor was an unassuming and selfless family man, whose calm presence would have comforted the boys in the cave.""He is brilliant with children, and he would have made sure that they were prepared in the best possible way from a cave-diving perspective,"" she said.""He would have been the perfect person to support them.""Joy and relief as Thai cave boys rescuedThe heroes who saved the Wild Boars'On social media, there has been an outpouring of gratitude directed towards him. Many have called for him to be made Australian of the Year - the nation's highest civic honour - while the government has indicated there will be some formal recognition.The experienced diver, also an underwater photographer, has completed several cave-diving expeditions in Australia, New Zealand, Christmas Island and China.One tragic expedition in 2011, involved the retrieval of the body of his friend, Agnes Milowka, who ran out of air during a cave dive in South Australia.Ms Bishop said the doctor is also known to authorities for his work on medical assistance teams in natural disasters in the Pacific region, and has taken part in Australian aid missions in Vanuatu.""[He] is an extraordinary Australian and he has certainly made a big difference to the rescue effort here in Thailand,"" she said.She also praised his diving partner, Craig Challen, a vet from Perth who accompanied Dr Harris into the caves. The pair were part of a team of 20 Australians, including police and navy divers, who assisted in the operation."
490,Cave rescue: Boys and football coach free from Tham Luang,"Divers in northern Thailand have rescued all 12 boys and their football coach from flooded caves, 17 days after they got trapped underground.Their plight and the massive, dangerous three-day-long operation to free them gripped the world's attention.The group was cut off on 23 June after heavy rains flooded their way back out.They were found by British divers last week, huddled in darkness on a ledge amid fears they could be forced to stay there for months until water receded.There were cheers as a daring rescue operation involving dozens of divers and hundreds of other rescue workers came to an end on Tuesday evening. Cave rescue as it happenedRescue story in picturesWho are the Thai boys?Who are the Thailand cave rescue divers?In an indication of how dangerous the journey out was, a former Thai navy diver died in the caves on Friday. Saman Gunan was returning from a mission to provide the group with air tanks when he ran out of oxygen.Aged between about 11 and 17, the members of the Wild Boars football team had entered the Tham Luang cave system in the province of Chiang Rai during an excursion with their coach.Confirming the completion of the rescue operation, the Thai Navy Seals Facebook page announced: ""All 12 Wild Boars and coach have been extracted from the cave. All are safe.""And at the house just below the mountains where the men who run the Wild Boars meet, there was laughter, shouts and cheers - and people shook hands in a very un-Thai way, says the BBC Jonathan Head.By Nick Beake, at Chiang Rai hospitalThis is the moment Mission Impossible became Mission Accomplished. Families in Chiang Rai gathered at the hospital to watch the final ambulances bring in their precious cargo. Some said they couldn't believe it, others said they had never lost hope. All wore the brightest of smiles. Up on the eighth floor, doctors - who declared this morning that the first eight boys to be rescued are doing well - will now be examining their remaining team mates and their coach. Psychologists will be assessing the impact a fortnight trapped underground has had. The Wild Boars footballers went into the Tham Luang cave as a team. They survived as a team. And tonight, at the end of a remarkable 72-hour rescue, they are together as a team once again.    The first eight boys to be rescued - on Sunday and Monday - are still in hospital but said to be in good mental and physical health.They have undergone X-rays and blood tests, and will remain under observation in hospital for at least seven days.Their parents have been allowed to see them through a glass window at the hospital, but they are being quarantined.Drinking contaminated water in the cave or being exposed to bird or bat droppings in the cave could lead to dangerous infections, experts say.Football offers support to boysThe boys lost weight during their time in the caves and are keen to eat. They are said to have requested a favourite pork dish, bread and chocolate, but solid food will have to be reintroduced slowly to prevent digestive upset. They will also need to wear sunglasses for a few days until their eyes readjust to the brighter light.Offers of hospitality for the football team have come in from around the world:Global football body Fifa offered the 12 young footballers tickets for Sunday's World Cup final in Moscow, but they are too weak to travel.Portuguese club Benfica has invited the boys and their coach an all-expenses-paid week at its training academy.Manchester United - the English club several of the boys support - has offered them the chance to attend a game.England players including Manchester City defender Kyle Walker are sending football kit to the boys after one of them was pictured wearing an England shirt inside the caves.A team of 90 expert divers - 40 from Thailand and 50 from overseas - worked in the Tham Luang caves.They guided the boys and their coach through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the cave system.Getting to and from the trapped group was an exhausting round trip, even for experienced divers. The process included a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes.How risky was the rescue?Wearing full-face masks, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy was accompanied by two divers, who also carried his air supply. The toughest part was about halfway out at a section named ""T-Junction"", which was so tight that the divers had to take off their air tanks to get through.Beyond that a cavern - called Chamber 3 - was turned into a forward base for the divers.There the boys could rest before making the last, easier walk out to the entrance. They were then taken to hospital in Chiang Rai.The last of the rescue team - three Thai Navy Seals and a doctor - emerged from the cave complex some hours after the last member of the trapped group was released.Captain Duganpet Promtep, 13, is described as a motivator and highly respected by his teammates. He had apparently been scouted by several Thai professional clubs.Myanmar-born Adul Sam-on, 14, speaks several languages, and was the only team member to be able to communicate with British divers when they were first discovered.It was 17-year-old Peerapat Sompiangjai's birthday when the group became trapped in the cave.  The snacks the boys brought with them to celebrate are likely to have helped them survive their ordeal.Assistant coach Ekapol Chantawong, 25, was said to be the weakest of the group when they were found, as he had reportedly refused to eat any of the food and gave it instead to the boys.Read more about the boys"
491,Why was Elon Musk at the Thai cave rescue?,"Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk's attempt to help the Thai cave rescue mission has attracted both praise and criticism.The SpaceX and Tesla chief posted on social media that he had visited the operation's command centre, where he said he had left a mini-submarine that had been designed to carry a trapped football team to safety.The head of the rescue mission thanked Mr Musk for his offer.But he said the sub could not be used.""The equipment they brought to help us is not practical with our mission,"" Narongsak Osotthanakorn explained.""Even though their equipment is technologically sophisticated, it doesn't fit with our mission to go in the cave.""Thai Navy Seals subsequently announced that all 12 boys and their coach had been brought out safely.Mr Musk has since tweeted an email from Richard Stanton - one of two British caving experts called in to front the rescue - which had urged the business leader to build the capsule as quickly as possible.All 13 out after 17-day ordealHow risky was the rescue?Live: All boys and coach rescuedMr Musk first suggested he could help save the trapped children and their football coach on 4 July, in response to a Twitter user's suggestion that he might be able to assist the effort at the Tham Luang caves in Chiang Rai.Two days later Mr Musk confirmed he was sending engineers from SpaceX and his Boring Company - which specialises in drilling - to Thailand. He followed with several posts speculating about possible technical solutions to the problem. These included a proposal for an air tube that could be inflated ""with air like a bouncy castle"", which he suggested could let the cut-off party walk to freedom.Mr Musk ultimately settled on turning part of one of SpaceX's Falcon rockets into a ""kid-size submarine"", and he posted videos of its tests online.When questioned whether the craft risked blocking a tight section of the tunnel system, he replied that his engineers had built an inflatable replica of the craft, which could be used to check that this would not happen. He added that a smaller version was also being built.""Based on extensive cave video review and discussion with several divers who know [the] journey, SpaceX engineering is absolutely certain that mini-sub can do entire journey and demonstrate at any time,"" he posted.Although the craft was not needed, Mr Musk has said that he has left the mini-sub with the Thai authorities ""in case it may be useful in the future"".The billionaire has form with making eye-catching humanitarian acts.Last year, he was thanked by Puerto Rico's governor for setting up a solar panel and battery system to provide power to a children's hospital in San Juan after it was hit by a hurricane.But while his most recent intervention has won him praise from some, others have questioned his motivations and suggested he might even have been a distraction.""Elon Musk is well known to have an eye for the headlines, but to be fair he only became involved after a message from one of his army of fans on Twitter,"" commented the BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones.""The fact that his company's space technology and its much vaunted tunnelling skills proved irrelevant to the operation is a reminder that sometimes this tech superhero doesn't quite match up to the Iron Man of his fans' dreams."""
492,In pictures: How the Thailand cave rescue unfolded,"The desperate effort to find and rescue a team of young footballers in Thailand from a flooded cave has gripped the world. After the last boys and their coach were rescued on Tuesday, we look back at how the story unfolded. On Saturday 23 June, 12 members of the Wild Boar soccer team, aged 11-16, entered the Tham Luang cave system in Thailand's Chiang Rai Province along with their 25-year-old football coach after a team practice. The cave system, which is 10km (6 miles) deep, is known locally for its deep recesses and narrow passages. The team has reportedly visited the cave before - but this time heavy rains cause flooding, impeding their exit. After the children fail to return home, they are reported missing and search efforts begin. Initial rescuers at the site reportedly find the team's bicycles, football boots and other belongings close to the cave's entrance. Media and volunteers start to gather at the site as heavy rain continues to complicate the search and rescue process. Who are the boys trapped in the cave?How the boys were savedThe brits who helped find the boys By Sunday family members reach the cave, praying and holding vigils for the missing children. Three days in, divers from the Royal Thai Navy arrive to assist in local search efforts.Fresh hand and footprints are spotted inside the vast cave complex, raising hopes for the group's safety.Government officials visit the site, and Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwon says the government is still optimistic the team can be found alive. Rescuers consider other routes in - teams of soldiers search for alternative entrance points and the authorities consider drilling into the mountain to get access.By Wednesday 27 June, diving and survival specialists from all around the world arrive in the country to help with search efforts.Relatives continue to hold vigils and pray at the site, as concern about the under-16 team's fate grows. Family members and officers are pictured fainting, and desperation deepens as weather conditions deteriorate.Thailand is now captivated by the desperate search, clinging to hope they can survive. Social media users share fan art in tribute to the missing 13, referring to them as ""the strangers we want to meet the most"".Pumps are brought in to try to help reduce the water levels in the cave, but continuing rain intermittently suspends efforts. Rescuers now believe and hope the team sought safety on a rock mound inside a cave chamber known as ""Patayya beach"". Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha visits relatives at the site and tries to offer comfort, telling them: ""They're athletes. They're strong."" The world's media has by now gathered at the site, with journalists staking out in the muddy conditions to hear the latest news.Over the weekend of 30 June, a break in rainy conditions allows divers to get further inside the cave than before. Supplies and air tanks are brought into the cave as the rescue teams advance. On Monday 2 July there is dramatic news - divers have found all of the boys and their coach safe nine days after they went missing. The team are found on a rock shelf about 4km (2.5 miles) from the cave mouth.A video showing the boys in apparent good health is released by the Thai Navy seals, but officials stress that the rescue effort remains complex.Medical aid and food is brought in to the team, as rescuers consider the best way to get them out to safety.Millions of litres of water are being pumped out of the cave system, but with the rainy season in full flow, officials warn the boys may have to learn to dive to get free - or wait months until conditions approve. The buoyant mood at the site then sours dramatically at the end of the week after a diver working on the rescue dies.It emerges that Saman Gunan, 38, a former Thai navy diver volunteering in the cave, lost consciousness while delivering oxygen air tanks.Tributes pour in for the lost diver, as concern is raised about the difficult task ahead.The commander of Thailand's Navy Seals warns that oxygen levels are dropping, as notes written by the team and coach emerge and are released.In a race against the rain, officials designate a ""limited"" window during which they believe the team can be successfully evacuated out.With conditions optimum on Sunday 8 July, ""D-Day"" comes and intensive rescue operations begin. Ambulances are pictured leaving the site, as speculation grows about how the rescue went. It is eventually confirmed that four of the boys have been safely brought out. Officials say the operation is running ""smoothly"", but efforts pause overnight to replace air tanks and let divers rest.The operation is very complex, and involves a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes already in place.At the end of Monday, it emerges that four more of the boys have been successfully freed. The story of Thailand's cave rescueThe government strictly guards information about the rescue, including the names of those who have been saved.The boys are held in hospital for supervision. Access for visiting parents is said to be limited because of potential health risks.On Tuesday there are high hopes for a successful rescue of everyone, as a final push starts to free those still inside.Efforts continue throughout Tuesday, until it is finally confirmed by officials that all 13 have been rescued safely.Locals and rescuers at the site celebrate, as the last boys and their coach are transferred to hospital, 17 days after getting trapped underground.

493,Cave rescue: Final push under way in Thailand,"Nineteen divers have entered the Tham Luang cave in northern Thailand on a gruelling, hazardous mission to rescue those people still trapped inside.They extracted a ninth boy on Tuesday, the Thai Navy said, with reports suggesting two more.If confirmed, one child and an adult remain to be rescued, bringing to a close an epic operation marred by one diver's death.  Eight boys rescued earlier are said to be in good mental and physical health.The group, a football team, had got stuck deep inside on 23 June after heavy rains caused flooding.After they were found by divers last week, huddled in darkness on a ledge and cut off from the outside world for nine days, the race began to get them out before the weather deteriorated even further.The boys evacuated so far have undergone X-rays and blood tests. They will remain under observation in hospital for at least seven days.Latest on the cave rescueWho are the Thai boys trapped in a cave?How risky is the Thai boys rescue?A doctor and Thai Navy Seal divers have been looking after those still on the ledge, about 4km (2.5 miles) from the cave's mouth.It kicked off just after 10:00 local time (03:00 GMT) when the 19 divers made their way into the cave. Rain was falling but rescuers say the water level inside the cave is similar to that on Sunday, the first day of the operation, an official said.Thai Navy SEALs confirmed a ninth child had been brought out at 16:06.Helicopter and ambulance activity in the cave area, from which the media have been barred, suggests that at least two more members of the Wild Boars football team were rescued and were being ferried to hospital.     By Michelle Roberts, BBC News  After the boys had spent so long in the cold and dark with poor ventilation and relatively little to eat and drink, there were concerns that they would be in a far worse state. Now that they are dry, warm and in safe care, full medical assessments can be done.None of the first eight has a fever - a sign of a possible infection - although two have needed antibiotic treatment for suspected lung infections. Doctors will be checking for any infections, such as ""caver's disease"", a lung disease caused by a fungus that grows in bat droppings. They will also make sure any cuts and scrapes that the boys have on their skin are clean and healing nicely.The boys remain in quarantine, meaning their parents will not be allowed any physical contact. This is partly to protect the boys from unnecessary infections until they regain their strength, as well as to prevent them passing on anything they might have picked up in the wet cave.They will need to build up their muscles and their immunity, as well as get used to living in the outside world again. For now, they wear shades to protect their eyes from the bright light.The first group of four boys was rescued on Sunday, followed by four more on Monday.Some of the boys had low temperatures, with one showing a low heart rate when they were first taken to hospital, but they have now recovered.""All eight are in good health, no fever... everyone is in a good mental state,"" Jesada Chokedamrongsuk, permanent secretary of the public health ministry, said at a news conference. Health officials say they were at first given instant food and energy gels but are now eating easy-to-digest food. They also say some of the boys have now seen their parents - but only through glass. Further test results are expected in a few days and if all signs of infection have cleared, families will be allowed to visit. However, they must don protective clothing and cannot go closer than 2m (6ft). However, Thailand's Prime Minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, has been allowed to visit the boys.A team of 90 expert divers - 40 from Thailand and 50 from overseas - have been working in the caves.They have been guiding the boys through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the Tham Luang cave system. Getting to and from where the boys are has been an exhausting round trip, even for the experienced divers. The process includes a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes already in place.Wearing a full-face mask, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy is being accompanied by two divers, who also carry his air supply. The operation in pictures 'I am dying to see him. I miss my son'Letters of love from trapped Thai boysThe toughest part is about halfway out at a section named ""T-Junction"", which is so tight the divers have to take off their air tanks to get through.Beyond that a cavern - called Chamber 3 - has been turned into a forward base for the divers.There the boys can rest before making the last, easier walk out to the entrance. They are then taken to hospital in Chiang Rai.In an indication of how dangerous the journey can be, a former Thai navy diver died in the caves on Friday. Saman Gunan was returning from a mission to provide the group with air tanks when he ran out of oxygen.The rescue mission chief said the second day of the operation had gone more smoothly than the first, taking two hours less as the procedure became more refined.A massive pumping operation is said to have helped lower the water level inside the cave system, making the journey in and out easier than it was.Aged between about 11 and 17 became trapped during an excursion with their coach.Some details have emerged of members of the team and their coach.Captain Duganpet Promtep, 13, is described as a motivator and highly respected by his teammates. He had apparently been scouted by several Thai professional clubs.Myanmar-born Adul Sam-on, 14, speaks several languages, and was the only team member to be able to communicate with British divers when they were first discovered.It was 17-year-old Peerapat Sompiangjai's birthday when the group became trapped in the cave.  The snacks the boys brought with them to celebrate are likely to have helped them survive their ordeal.Assistant coach Ekapol Chantawong, 25, was said to be the weakest of the group when they were found, as he had reportedly refused to eat any of the food and gave it instead to the boys."
494,Cave rescue: Four more boys rescued by Thai Navy divers,"Divers have rescued four more boys from a vast cave system in northern Thailand on the second day of a complex operation.The Thai Navy Seals leading the rescue operation have confirmed that eight boys in total have been extracted.Four boys and their football coach remain inside the caves. Rescuers will try to free them on Tuesday.The group became trapped on 23 June after heavy rains caused flooding, and was found last week by divers.Four boys were brought out safely on Sunday, but the mission was paused overnight for air tanks to be replaced.On Monday, air ambulances were seen departing from the area around the cave system and ambulances were seen arriving at the hospital in the nearby town of Chiang Rai. The boys have not been seen in public, but have been pronounced to be in reasonable health.Who are the Thai boys trapped in a cave?How risky is the Thai boys rescue?The rescue operation is complicated by sections in the cave involving diving - sometimes in very confined spaces - and climbing.The BBC's Dan Johnson, at the scene, says it is a careful, delicate operation fraught with risk. But he adds that this daring, dangerous and complicated exercise is delivering success against difficult odds, and relief is starting to break the tension of the situation.After Monday's operation had wound down for the day, rescue mission chief Narongsak Osottanakorn told reporters: ""All four boys have arrived at hospital, all are safe.""He said the second day of the operation had gone more smoothly than the first, taking two hours less as the procedure became more refined.Tuesday morning will see the start of attempts to rescue the remaining four boys and the football coach. A massive pumping operation is said to have helped lower the water level inside the cave system, making the journey in and out easier than it was.The Thai authorities say the rescued boys are able to eat rice porridge, although their request for a favourite pork dish has been turned down until their digestive systems recover from 10 days without food. The government is strictly controlling information about the rescue. The names of the boys who got out have not been released, and even their parents have not been allowed to see them - for health reasons, say Thai officials.By Martin Patience, Chiang RaiOutside the hospital where the boys were being received, there was a heavy police and media presence.Early in the afternoon, the sound of a helicopter thudded overhead. It was a sign that the rescue operation was going to plan.A few minutes later, a convoy with an ambulance swept through the streets and swung into the hospital entrance. It was carrying the first boy rescued on Monday.Then as dusk was falling, a small crowd of locals gathered outside the hospital. Word was filtering out that more boys had been rescued. People were straining to catch a glimpse of the unfolding drama.It came in the form of the flashing lights of three more ambulances - signifying the rescue of three more boys.The rescue operation will resume on Tuesday. It is not yet over and is still fraught with danger. But people here are daring to believe what seemed impossible a little over a week ago - that all the boys and their coach will come out of the cave alive.A team of 90 expert divers - 40 from Thailand and 50 from overseas - has been working in the cave system. They have been guiding the boys through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the Tham Luang cave system.

495,British backpacker Calvin Hill moved to Thailand hospital,"A British backpacker who contracted sepsis after being bitten by a mosquito has been moved to a Thai hospital after being ""stuck"" overseas for two months. Calvin Hill, 27, from Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, was flown to Thailand on Sunday after being in the Cambodian hospital for nine weeks. His relatives said doctors estimate he will be there for about another month. The family have spent £8,000 travelling back and forth to be with Mr Hill since May. Mr Hill was transported to Thailand by medic plane, more than two months after developing sepsis from the mosquito bite. He was found by roommates in a hostel, unconscious and ""not breathing properly"", three days before he was due home. He spent two weeks in a coma, with doctors telling his family to expect the worst.Despite doctors' predictions he has since come out of the coma and is now able to talk and move his limbs, but is half of his original weight and has a hole in his foot.Daughter's death from sepsis 'will stay with me forever'Derek Brockway on dad's sepsis deathSepsis: Why can it be so hard to spot?""They are saying he's too unwell to bring home, but he's never going to get better until he comes home,"" his mother Tracey said.She felt that the hospital in Thailand was ""much better"". ""Thailand has better resources and the nurses are really looking after him."" ""They are running tests at the moment which will show us where we are.""Mr Hill is unable to fly home at the moment because he needs to lie down during the flight, and would not be able to sit up for landing and take off.

It has embarked on a dangerous option but believes it's the best for bringing the group out alive.It has assembled a team of internationally renowned divers and so far their expertise has brought four boys - thought to be the weakest - back to their families.But the relief of those mums and dads will be tempered by the knowledge that nine other families face an anxious wait for the turn of their loved ones to be shepherded through the narrow and murky corridors of the Tham Luang cave complex.As one diving expert put it to me, when underwater cave rescues go wrong they go wrong in a big way. So despite this promising start, there is a sense of unease here in Chiang Mai. But the overriding impression from the rescuers is a clear focus and unshakable resolve to finish the job.

Bore holes have also been drilled into the rock to try to drain water out and give the boys more time.It has previously been said that they could be underground for months, either learning to dive or waiting for the water to recede or be pumped out.Earlier on Saturday, Mr Narongsak said the boys had not yet learned the diving skills to allow for their safe passage.Separately, billionaire technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, who has offered his assistance to the rescue operations, said he had received ""more great feedback"" from cave experts in Thailand on two possible rescue options his team have been working on. Musk said on Twitter than one potential solution involved an ""kid-sized submarine"", while another was an ""inflatable tube with airlocks"". It is not clear if either will be used in the rescue operations.The ideal scenario is for enough water to have been pumped out to allow the group to climb out.Mr Narongsak has not specified the course of action for these next few crucial days.

""Teacher, don't give us lots of homework!"" he joked.The football coach who took the boys into the cave apologised to parents, but they wrote he was not to blame.Officials say that they have a window of up to four days before rains will make the rescue more difficult.The boys were exploring the cave when they became trapped by floodwaters on 23 June.The handwritten letters from the group were handed to British divers on Friday and released on the Thai Navy Seal Facebook page on Saturday.""Don't worry about me, I'm safe."" a boy nicknamed Pong said. Another wrote: ""Nick loves Mum and Dad and siblings. If I can get out, Mum and Dad please bring me mookatha (Thai barbecue) to eat.""In full: Thai boys' letters of love and reassuranceIn his letter, the 25-year-old coach Ekkapol Chantawong, also known as Ake, said: ""Dear all kids' parents, now all of them are fine, the rescue team is treating us well.""And I promise I will take care of the kids as best as I can... I also sincerely apologise to the kids' parents.""In their letters, posted on the local government's Facebook page, several parents make clear that they do not blame the coach.""Mums and dads are not angry at you. Thank you for helping take care of the kids,"" one said.Another reads: ""Tell Coach Ake: Don't think too much. We are not angry at him.""It was the first communication since attempts to establish a phone line inside the cave failed earlier this week.Helier Cheung, BBC News, Maesai districtThe letters make for remarkable reading. Words of love, reassurance and encouragement are interspersed with talk of food the boys are craving - and birthday parties.At least two of the boys have had their birthdays while stuck inside the cave.One of them, Note, has just turned 15.At the MyWay garage, where Note's father works, some of the workers have known Note since he was born - and describe him as a smart kid who loves sport and helps his father with mechanical work over the holidays.They were touched by his letter - but still full of concern for the boys.One of them, Rinlinee Sombat, told the BBC: ""He writes just like his Mum. But I want to see him even more than I want to see his handwriting.""Meanwhile, Ponrawee Tachavandee said he had spoken to Note's mother on Friday night - and she had been distraught since learning about the death of a Thai navy diver that day.He said she had told him that the ""navy Seal had practised for so long, and was so strong, but also died. How about a boy who has never dived before?"" The boys were found inside the cave by British rescue divers on Monday, 10 days after they went missing. They were perched on a rock shelf in a small chamber about 4km (2.5 miles) from the cave mouth.How risky is the Thai boys rescue?'I am dying to see him. I miss my son''You never imagine someone you know could get trapped'Teams of Thai and international divers have since supplied them with food, oxygen and medical attention.There are concerns about the falling oxygen level in the chamber, but officials say an air line into the cave has now been installed.The danger of their situation became clear when a former Thai navy diver died after delivering air tanks to the group on Friday.Above ground, a huge military and civilian operation is racing against the clock to bring the boys out. Monsoon rains are threatening further flooding in the coming weeks and month.The Brits behind the Thai cave boys searchElon Musk offers to help Thai cave rescueOn Saturday, the governor of the Chiang Rai region, where the cave is located, said the next three to four days were ""the most favourable time for the operation in terms of the water, the weather and the boys' health"".Narongsak Osottanakorn said that after that, further rains could imperil the group.""The water level may rise to the area where the children are sitting and make the area less than 10 sq m [100 sq ft],"" he said.Another concern, he added, was the growing concentration of carbon dioxide exhaled by the boys and rescue workers.He gave no details about how the rescue might be carried out.Meanwhile, rescuers outside have dug more than 100 holes in an attempt to reach the cave by a direct route."
506,Cave rescue: Thai boys and parents send letters of love and reassurance,"An exchange of letters between relatives and the 12 Thai boys and their coach who are trapped in a flooded cave has been released.Below is a selection of some of the messages: the letters from inside the cave are on the light coloured paper, while the responses are on the darker paper (some of the exchanges have been annotated).Letters from boys:Mig: Don't worry about me, I miss everyone...

507,Thailand cave rescue: Boys 'can walk but can't dive yet',"Twelve boys and their football coach trapped in waterlogged caves in Thailand will not be rescued overnight as they cannot dive, an official says.An air line has been installed to the cave where the group has been trapped for nearly two weeks in a chamber in the Tham Luang cave complex.The group had ventured in while the cave was dry but rain then flooded it.Earlier, a former Thai navy diver died on his way out of the caves after delivering air tanks to those trapped.Speaking to reporters on Friday, the governor of the Chiang Rai region, where the cave is situated, said the boys had enough strength to walk but could not swim to safety.Narongsak Osotthanakorn said the health of most of the boys had ""improved to normal"", and that divers were continuing to teach diving and breathing techniques.When asked if a rescue attempt would be made overnight if it started to rain, he said: ""No, the boys can't dive at this time.""Locals long to see missing Thai cave boysWhat are the rescue options?Mr Narongsak said the boys were ""OK"" and the air they were breathing was good. On Thursday their parents sent letters in for the boys to read - but the governor said he was not sure if these had reached them yet. Rescuers have dug more than 100 holes, hoping to reach the cave by a direct route. There were 18 promising ones, the deepest at 400m, but Mr Narongsak said he was not sure if it would reach the boys, who are believed to be about 600m below the surface.The group was found in the cave by British rescue divers 10 days after they went missing. They were perched on a rock shelf in a small chamber about 4km (2.5 miles) from the cave mouth.Teams of Thai and international divers have since supplied them with food, oxygen and medical attention, but there are mounting concerns about the oxygen level in the chamber, which officials said had fallen to 15%. The usual level is 21%.The Brits behind the Thai cave boys searchElon Musk offers to helpMr Narongsak said discussions regarding the lowest risk rescue attempts were ongoing, but acknowledged that time was against them. ""We will try to set the best plan, when the risk is minimal, we will try to bring them out,"" he said. He added that the rains had stopped in the past few days, giving the rescue operation some space to make several areas in the cave dry enough for rescue workers to access.He also said that when teams had stopped pumping water for 12 minutes during the day on Friday, the water level in the cave rose by 10cm (4in).On the surface, a huge military and civilian rescue operation is racing against the clock to bring the boys to safety. Heavy monsoon rains are expected on Sunday, threatening further flooding.Officials had initially considered leaving the boys in the chamber to wait out the rainy season - which could have seen them trapped there for up to four months.Saman Gunan - a highly trained diver - lost consciousness on his way out of the cave complex on Thursday. His death underscored the danger of moving from the chamber to mouth of the cave, and raised serious doubts about the safety of bringing the boys out through the cramped, flooded passageways.The diver died in one of the passageways, said Passakorn Boonyaluck, deputy governor of the Chiang Rai region.""His job was to deliver oxygen. He did not have enough on his way back,"" Mr Passakorn said.He said that Saman's dive partner had tried to revive him but was unable to.Saman, who was reportedly 38, had left the navy but returned to aid in the rescue operation. Said to be an avid runner and cyclist, he was part of the massive rescue operation launched after the group became stranded in the Tham Luang cave.Officials said his funeral would be sponsored by the Thai king.

509,Thailand tourist boat sinking: At least 33 confirmed dead off Phuket,"At least 33 people are known to have died after a tourist boat carrying mostly Chinese passengers capsized off the Thai holiday island of Phuket.The news came as Thai authorities suspended their search for missing passengers for a second night.The Phoenix - which had 105 people on board - went down in bad weather on Thursday evening.Phuket provincial governor Noraphat Plodthong said 23 people were still unaccounted for, with 49 rescued.On Friday, Mr Noraphat told reporters the rescue operation had to be paused until Saturday morning because of strong winds and rough seas, which were making it too dangerous for divers to continue their work.What can we expect from this year's monsoon season?The Phoenix was reportedly carrying 93 passengers, 11 crew members and an individual tour guide when it got caught in bad weather off the coast of Phuket on Thursday. Conditions were said to have created waves up to 5m (16ft) high, causing the Phoenix to overturn and sink.A total of 48 passengers were rescued by a fishing trawler on Thursday, while another female survivor was pulled from the water several miles from the boat, along with several bodies, according to AFP news agency.The woman was rushed to hospital, but her condition is unknown. A total of 37 people have received treatment in hospital.Divers discovered several bodies while searching inside the hull of the submerged vessel on Friday, according to the Thai Navy. Helicopters also joined the search for survivors. The Phoenix overturned in the Andaman Sea off the coast of Koh He, which is an islet known for its coral formations and has become popular among tourists visiting Phuket.Wu Jun, 28, told AFP that he was celebrating his honeymoon with his wife Long Haining on the Phoenix when the boat started to tilt in the water. ""The skies were clear when we went out, we had no idea the weather could change so fast,"" he said, from the hospital where his wife is being treated.China's foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang, said on Friday that his country was sending a ""taskforce"" to Thailand to help the authorities deal with the incident. ""We hope that the Thai side can continue their best efforts and... do their best to treat the injured, comfort relatives and deal with other follow-up measures,"" he said.The Phoenix was among several boats that appeared to have ignored a warning in place since Wednesday not to take tourists on daytrips to the islands off Phuket because of ""strong winds and storms"", officials said.An investigation has been ordered into why a number of boats went out despite the severe weather warnings.In a separate incident, 39 people were saved when another vessel, carrying mostly European passengers, overturned at about the same time.Mr Noraphat said that a further 10 smaller boats were also left stranded at sea on Thursday. Thailand is bracing for the arrival of its monsoon season."
510,Thailand cave rescue: England player's message for trapped boys,England player John Stones says he hopes the boys and their football coach trapped in a Thai cave emerge 'safe and sound'.
511,Thailand cave rescue: A community united in hope,"On Friday morning, the army of volunteers at the mouth of the Tham Luang cave in Thailand had the worst news so far - a former Thai navy diver, Saman Gunan, had died.He had been delivering air tanks to the 12 young boys and their football coach trapped underground. The joy and elation that came after the group were found alive earlier this week has faded away. Now the mood at the rescue site is sombre, with diving volunteers saying they are saddened by Gunan's death. For the local community, and those who watched the boys grow up, the plight of the group has been deeply upsetting. ""You never imagine someone you know could get trapped in a cave,"" says shopkeeper Patcharee Khumngen. One of the boys, known as most Thai children are by a nickname - his was Note - rode a bike to her shop to buy snacks when he was eight years old.""He's a good boy, very friendly, and always liked to joke around,"" she told the BBC.Hope grows for daring rescueWhat are the rescue options?How will the boys cope underground?""Now that he's in his teens he looks quite handsome,"" she added, with the fondness of an auntie. ""I've known his parents since he was a little boy."" The story has hit the community particularly hard because the cave is just 4km (2.5 miles) away from the local neighbourhood, Maesai, where some of the boys went to school. It's a spot popular with day trips and visited by local children. When the news first emerged two weeks ago that the local boys - all members of the same football team, the Wild Boars - and their coach were lost in the vast cave, the village rallied together, donating food and money.Patcharee prepared sticky rice and deep fried pork - two popular local dishes. In Thai culture, this is a common way of showing care for someone. Nearby, at Ban Pa Muat School, teacher Bunjob Chai-arm was also worried.He taught one of the boys, nicknamed Mark, back when he was in primary school.He was a ""cheerful, energetic and friendly"" student, and they had stayed in touch as he began secondary school, he told the BBC.Mark loves playing volleyball and, along with another one of the boys, is a member of a local team that came second in a tournament featuring teams from across northern Thailand. Bunjob said he was particularly worried about Mark, ""one of the youngest in the cave"". At school, once they learned that their classmate was missing, students asked Bunjob to turn on the TV so they could follow the news - as they are not allowed to use phones in class.""For a whole week, some students were in class while others were following the news on TV,"" he says. Meanwhile, the school came together, donating money to help the parents of the missing boys with rent and living expenses, as many had stopped work to wait at the cave and follow news of their sons. The plight of the boys appears to have united the community.""Every house here has been talking about the news of the boys,"" says Koywilai Promwijit, who works in a local salon. ""The village has donated hundreds of packages of food.""She and her sister helped prepare fried pork, chicken, sticky rice and chilli paste, eating less during some of their own meals so they could help.Koywilai's face lights up when she recalls the moment she learned the boys were still alive late last Sunday.  ""I was about to go to bed when I heard the news - and then I couldn't sleep.""Video shows Thai cave boys in good healthThe Brits behind the Thai cave boys searchThe site of the rescue operations in Tham Luang Forest Park, near the entrance of the cave, is buzzing with activity. The first thing you see as you get near is a steady stream of water. The efforts to save the boys have been described as a ""race against the water"" - and engineers have been working around the clock, pumping out millions of gallons of water from the cave. Hundreds of volunteers and journalists have been drawn to the small rural district in Chiang Rai province.Given the huge numbers of people crowded into a small country park area, it is surprising how well organised and orderly the public areas are.The site is divided into several zones - restricted areas are where the Thai Navy Seals, other military personnel and civilian rescuers are based.The public areas include first-aid tents with medics and mental health first aiders, registration points for volunteers, a media zone, and several food stalls where workers from the Thai royal kitchen have been preparing food for volunteers.The relatives of the boys are also in the public areas - but their tents are guarded to ensure their privacy. There is a friendly mood among the volunteers - and a keen sense from everyone that they would like to help however they can. At one point, some volunteers offered massages to those at the site. Others distributed bottles of water and ice lollies to journalists.There is even a system to keep the toilets clean. Everyone is required to step into a basin of water, to wash the mud off their boots, before entering.Varee Srichai, a farmer in Chiang Mai, was one of the volunteers washing down the area.She takes pride in her role in the rescue operations, and told me: ""I plan to stay here until the boys are rescued."" There are countless stories like hers. Sam Chareanphol, a village police assistant from Maesai district, headed to the cave on the second day after the boys went missing, and has been shuttling volunteers, journalists and rescuers up and down the hill on his motorcycle.Saran Churat, a local public servant, said he decided to volunteer because ""I consider the boys in the caves as my brothers"".He added: ""As you can see, everyone is ready to gather here and give a hand.""Rafael Aloush and his son Shlomi travelled up from Udon Thani province.Rafael, who is Israeli, has been cave diving before and went into Tham Luang cave 25 years ago, although he did not travel as deep as the boys.""I've seen the mothers of the kids on TV and it just breaks my heart. I have to do something about it,"" he said.He is volunteering as a diver and translator, while Shlomi, who is studying business management in Bangkok, also hopes to help with translating.The early days of the rescue operations were particularly chaotic, as teams struggled to find the right equipment and divers with cave-diving experience.Local Max Yuttapong Kumsamut drove to the site overnight when he saw the difficulties rescuers were facing.He'd seen photos of the operation, and could tell that the water pump was too small for the rescue operations.""I have experience in mining and underground water... so I wanted to help however I could,"" he told the BBC.""At the time when the incident happened, no-one really had any idea what to do.""Everything had happened so quickly [and] this had never happened in Thailand before. Officials did whatever they could, they brought together equipment, even though it's not the right equipment - small water pumps, long pipes, short pipes, agricultural piping, knives, shovels - with limited time and planning.""Because of his experience in installing pumps, Max helped examine the set-up inside the cave, radioing a team outside with what parts and fittings needed to be ordered.He has stayed on at the site to help with translation work and transporting goods.Further up the hill leading to the cave, there are Navy Seals and other rescue divers - and a regular stream of soldiers carrying supplies to and from the cave. A rescue base has been set up far inside.The boys are safe for now, perched on a tall ledge in the cave, surrounded by water.Video footage from earlier this week shows the boys looking thin and tired, but in good spirits. Many of them were wearing football shirts. But rescuers still need to find a way to bring them out. The route is a long and windy path with narrow openings that is fully submerged in water in places. It's an extremely difficult operation. The cave is dark, and the boys are several kilometres deep inside. They don't know how to swim - and some parts of the cave are too narrow to wear scuba tanks. It's a perilous journey, as diver Gunan's death illustrates only too well. He fell unconscious as he was making the difficult five-hour journey back after taking air tanks into the cave. He was reportedly 38, and fit and well. He was an avid runner and cyclist - and was once a member of Thailand's national triathlon team. He was popular within the trail-running community in Thailand. Thai Seal commander Rear Adm Arpakorn Yookongkaew has vowed that ""we will not let the sacrifice of our friend go to waste"".Officials say their priority is now to get a pipe carrying oxygen into the boys' cave, as the air quality is deteriorating. Rescuers have also been trying to set up cables leading to the cave - including a communications line so they can speak to their parents, and a line providing more air.But the cave is long, with too many twists and turns - and they have been unable to connect the cables to them so far. While rescue efforts have been helped by mostly dry weather for the past few days, water levels could rise again once the monsoon rains start. Unless the water levels drop, or the boys learn to dive - a difficult task even for adults in these circumstances - they could be there for months. If and when the boys and their coach are safely rescued, they'll face an immense amount of media attention.The local area has also become famous - and Thai tourism officials have said they plan to promote the cave as a tourist attraction.For locals, the incident is primarily an important reminder about safety.After this, ""everyone will know you are not supposed to go in the cave during the rainy season"", says Koywilai. Meanwhile, Bunjob hopes that Mark will soon be able to share his experiences with the classmates waiting desperately for news.""I wish they could come out soon,"" he says. "
512,Thailand cave rescue: Ex-navy diver dies on oxygen supply mission,"A former Thai navy diver has died while taking part in efforts to rescue 12 boys and their football coach trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand.Petty Officer Saman Gunan lost consciousness on his way out of the Tham Luang cave complex, where he had been delivering air tanks.The boys have been trapped for nearly two weeks in a chamber in the cave.They ventured in while the cave was dry but were caught out by a sudden deluge of rain, which flooded the system.The group was found by British rescue divers after 10 days in the cave, perched on a rock shelf in a small chamber about 4km (2.5 miles) from the cave mouth.Teams of Thai and international divers have since supplied them with food, oxygen and medical attention, but there are mounting concerns about the oxygen level in the chamber, which officials said had fallen to 15%. The usual level is 21%.Locals long to see missing Thai cave boysWhat are the rescue options?On the surface, a huge military and civilian rescue operation is racing against the clock to bring the boys to safety. Heavy monsoon rains are expected on Sunday, threatening further flooding.Officials had initially considered leaving the boys in the chamber to wait out the rainy season - which could have seen them trapped there for up to four months.But Thailand's Navy Seal commander suggested on Thursday that the divers may now have little choice but to attempt a daring emergency rescue - fraught with danger for the boys, who are aged 11 to 16 and some of whom cannot swim.""At first, we thought the children could stay for a long time... but now things have changed, we have a limited time,""  Rear Admiral Apakorn Yookongkaew said.The death of Saman - a highly trained diver - on Thursday underscored the danger of moving from the chamber to mouth of the cave, and raised serious doubts about the safety of bringing the boys out through the cramped, flooded passageways.The diver died after losing consciousness in one of the passageways, said Passakorn Boonyaluck, deputy governor of the Chiang Rai region, where the cave is situated.""His job was to deliver oxygen. He did not have enough on his way back,"" Mr Passakorn said.He said that Saman's dive partner tried to revive him but could not, and his body was brought out of the cave.The Brits behind the Thai cave boys searchElon Musk offers to helpSaman, who was reportedly 38, had left the navy but returned to aid in the rescue operation. Said to be an avid runner and cyclist, he was part of the massive rescue operation launched after the group became stranded in the Tham Luang cave.Officials said his funeral would be sponsored by the Thai king. The search operation would go on, said Rear Adm Arpakorn. ""I can guarantee that we will not panic, we will not stop our mission, we will not let the sacrifice of our friend go to waste,"" he said.About 1,000 people are involved in the rescue operation, including navy divers, military personnel and civilian volunteers. Authorities say there are concerns about falling oxygen levels in the chamber where the boys and their coach are trapped.Oxygen was being depleted by the large number of people working inside the cave network, said the Chiang Rai Governor, Narongsak Osotthanakorn.Authorities are now working to get a 5km (3 mile) cable into the cave to supply the group with air. They are also trying to feed a fibre optic cable through to the group, to connect them to their families for the first time in nearly two weeks.The boys are being regularly supplied with food and medical care, but there are grave concerns over heavy rainfall forecast for Sunday.Authorities are trying to work out how best to bring the group to safety, with officials stressing they do not intend to take any risks with the boys' safety.The military has been pumping water out of the cave but if it cannot hold the water level down, it will be left a stark reality: teaching the boys to use diving equipment and bringing them via a route which has already cost one trained diver his life.Some local groups are searching in the hills for unknown entrances to the cave system, but none has yet been found.If a rescue attempt fails, leaving the boys to wait out the rain brings with it another danger: that the sinkholes and streams in the hills above could flood the chamber completely.Sophie Long in Chiang RaiRescue operation leaders here say most of those involved have been trained to work in high risk environments, and to deal with eventualities like this. They say the death of Saman won't impact on their mission. But there is a different atmosphere today in the makeshift village that's evolved at the cave's entrance, and the death of a former navy Seal highlights just how dangerous the route out of the cave remains. It is unlikely the boys will be told about the death. One of the prime concerns here is to keep them not just physically but mentally strong. Today, the priority is to connect the fibre optic cable that will allow the boys to speak to their families. It is hoped it will be a vital boost for the young boys, after two long weeks underground."
513,Thailand cave: Rescuers in race against weather as rains close in,"Rescuers are racing against the rains to free 12 boys and their football coach, who are trapped in a flooded cave in northern Thailand.A deluge is expected to hit in a matter of days that could force the water level up, threatening to flood the pocket where the group took refuge.The teenage boys and their 25-year-old coach have been trapped for 12 days.They were found on Monday night by rescue divers, on a rock shelf about 4km (2.5 miles) from the cave mouth.The boys have now received food, foil blankets, and medical attention, and rescuers are trying to run cables through the cave tunnel so they can speak to their families.The region of Chiang Rai where the boys are trapped has for the past few days experienced a dry spell, and rescuers have taken advantage of this to pump water out of the cave complex.What are the rescue options?Hope grows for daring rescueAbout 128 million litres of water had been pumped out by Thursday, with the water levels coming down at an average rate of 1.5cm per hour. Rescue workers are now able to walk through a 1.5km (0.9 mile) stretch from the entrance to what's being called the third chamber. But heavy monsoon rains are forecast for Sunday. Chiang Rai Governor Narongsak Osotthanakorn said they were ""racing against water"".""We are calculating how much time we have it if rains, how many hours and days,"" he said.The Tham Luang cave complex is regularly flooded during the rainy season until September or October, raising fears that a delay could leave the boys trapped in the cave for months.There is hope that enough water can be pumped out of the cave tunnels for the boys to be able to wade - or be floated - out.But rescuers are also planning for other eventualities.A team are exploring the forested mountain land above the cave complex to see if they can find a chimney down to the cavern sheltering the boys. They have enlisted the help of bird-watchers, who are specialists in finding hidden holes, the AFP news agency reports.Thai Navy Seal divers are also teaching the boys the basics of diving, with a view to guiding them out through flooded waters if necessary.But such a rescue would be fraught with risk, say experts. Many of the boys cannot swim or dive, and there is a high risk they might panic in the dark, murky, narrow waterways. Video shows Thai cave boys in good healthThe Brits behind the Thai cave boys searchHow will the boys cope underground?The journey for the group to travel up to the cave entrance would take around five hours, rescue divers say.The Thai military has previously said that if the boys can't dive out, the group may have to wait for up to four months for flooding to recede before they can leave. Food and other supplies are being put in place for that eventuality. Helier Cheung, BBC News, Tham Luang caveRescue teams are working in extremely difficult conditions. The heat has been sweltering and unrelenting, at over 30C, while much of the site is submerged in squelchy mud that is several inches thick in places and extremely slippery. But the work has continued at an unrelenting pace. Everyone is aware that once the monsoon rains start, rescue efforts will be much more difficult. Meanwhile, hundreds of workers are helping to keep the site in order, with road engineers laying gravel to try and secure the mud, workers for the Thai royal kitchen providing hot food for everyone, and volunteers handing out water bottles and ice lollies to those on site.One local civil servant, who had volunteered to help hand out supplies, said he did not know the boys personally but had decided to help because ""I consider the boys in the caves as my brothers"". Video from Thai Navy special forces on Monday showed the boys looking emaciated but smiling and at times laughing.The arrival of food, foil blankets and the prospect of speaking to their loved ones will have buoyed their spirits.But concern is mounting for both their physical and mental health after 12 days below ground - and it is not clear how they would be helped to survive months more in the cave.The boys and their coach had gone on their bikes up to the caves on Saturday 23 June after football practice. It was one boy's 16th birthday, and the team had taken a picnic.They knew the caves, and some reports suggest they had wanted to explore deeper than on previous occasions.They entered the cave when it was dry but sudden heavy rains quickly flooded the exit and rushed through the narrow passages, clogging them with mud and debris."
514,Thailand cave: Hope grows for a daring rescue of trapped boys,"In the bleak hours when there was no news of the missing boys, a new community emerged on the side of this mountain. Divers, cavers, and soldiers all trudged purposefully through the thick mud, focused on their own small role in what felt like a national effort.Now that the 12 boys and their football coach have been located, the mood in the camp has transformed. It is a place of hope, energy, and purpose. Yo Sato is 27. He grew up in east London but returned to Thailand to teach English. He drove for hours to get here to offer his service as a translator for the local police.""I'm speechless, I've got goose-bumps right now,"" he says.""Seeing those kids alive just changes people's mood. People are working so hard, it's so tiring. But now, they are all smiling. And seeing the British and the Thai working together, it's just the best thing ever.""Classmates of the young footballers come to the mouth of the cave to show their support. At the spot where their friends last glimpsed the outside world, they sing for them.""Believe in God. Only belief can move a mountain,"" go the lyrics of the song they sing.Looking on, just a few metres away, are the rescue teams, planning how they can enter this particular mountain and bring the boys to safety. Everywhere you turn, small squadrons of men and women in matching colours huddle and nod in agreement. They are surrounded on every side by scores of international news teams who have filled this corner of a usually tranquil forest.It is the Thai Navy Seals the journalists want to talk to the most. Videos of the boys posted to Facebook by the Seals have delighted and amazed people at the camp. There are other, regular soldiers too who don't get the same star treatment. But you feel their presence. Every now and then they emerge from their makeshift barracks and stand arm in arm, in a human chain.Their role is to block the media's path when heavy machinery is brought in, or when the medical teams are rehearsing for final stages of a rescue. They can be seen carrying empty stretchers out from the entrance to the cave and placed in ambulances which speed off into the distance.It is still not clear when the soldiers will be called upon for real. Until that time, an army of volunteers needs to be fed.Servers in yellow uniforms scoop steaming rice and fish curry on to plates for a never-ending queue of hungry workers. In fact, there is a wide choice and favourite dining spots are emerging. Workmen drenched in sweat and cave water lurk optimistically to see if the next fresh batch of chicken is ready. And the most popular woman in Thailand appears to be the one who loudly declares the ice-creams have arrived.Among the servers is Lakhana Didyasarin, the director of the American School of Bangkok. ""I have brownies, cookies and hotdogs,"" she says.In fact, she brought 1,600 hotdogs, and they are all gone. It was her duty as a Thai to come and help, she says, and it was a ""dream came true"" when the boys were found.""We have found them now,"" she says. ""The second stage will be much easier. We have doctors, nurses, experts - every person needed to help them out.""Like so many here, she says she is going nowhere. This unlikely army - professional and amateur - won't leave until the boys are safe.So this remarkable mountainside community, born in such bleak hours, continues to grow, and the sound of children singing drifts across the forest.

515,Thai cave rescue: Chilean miner's message to trapped boys,Mario Sepulveda was one of 33 men rescued from a mine in Chile in 2010. He has now sent a message of encouragement to the 12 boys and their coach trapped in a cave in Thailand.
516,Thailand cave rescue: What are the options?,Bill Whitehouse from the British Cave Rescue Council explains how the 12 Thai boys and their coach might be rescued.They have been trapped in a cave for 13 days.
517,Thailand cave: New video shows boys in good health,"A new video has been released of the 12 boys and their football coach trapped in a Thai cave, in which they say they are in good health.Smiling and at times laughing, they introduce themselves one by one.They were found on Monday after nine days trapped deep in the cave by rising water, and have since received food and medical treatment.But their rescue may take months as they must either be taught to dive or wait for the water to recede. The concern is that the rainy season has only just begun, so water levels in the Tham Luang cave will almost certainly continue to rise. How will the boys cope underground?What are the rescue options?The video posted on the Thai Navy special forces Facebook page shows the team draped in foil blankets to keep them warm. Lit by torches and with divers sitting alongside, they each give their name and the traditional ""wai"" greeting, putting their palms together. Two other videos show the group having some light scratches treated by a military doctor. The boys are also again seen asking how soon food is coming. Written on a rock in the cave can be seen the name of the football team and of the navy unit involved in the rescue.Two Thai navy divers will be staying with the group underground from now on.""Now we are teaching the children to swim and dive,"" Thai Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan was quoted as saying by the Reuters news agency.A report in The Guardian says the boys are being trained to breathe through scuba masks.But a source inside the Thai navy diving team has told the BBC that taking the boys, few of whom can even swim, out through the narrow flooded passages is too risky. He said the journey in to where they were, deep in the caves, had exhausted even experienced divers. So they were seriously considering keeping the boys there for the full four or five months of the rainy season, he added.Some of the route involves squeezing through tight gaps underwater. In parts it is too narrow to wear an oxygen tank and the exits are not visible, so it would be easy for a child to panic.However, other Thai officials say they may need to bring the boys out quickly if water levels rise. Weather forecasts for the area are being closely monitored for heavy rain which could trigger further flooding.Before they were found, they would have lived in total darkness once any torch batteries had expired.However, the three basic conditions for survival were met: The temperature in the cave is thought to be around 26C (79F) so hypothermia was not an issueThere was sufficient oxygen because air enters through porous limestone or cracks in the rocks. They had drinkable water Oxygen may yet become a problem should the water level rise and the air pocket they are in get smaller.  Unknown factors include the possibility of dangerous animals like snakes in the cave or of contamination from bat droppings.Rescuers are trying to work out how best to bring them all to safety, with officials stressing they do not intend to take any risks with the boys' safety.At a news conference, officials said no rescue attempt would be made on Wednesday but conditions were perfect for a rehearsal. Water continues to be pumped out of the cave complex and officials have said they are confident they have been able to stop more water getting into the chamber the boys are in. Emergency teams are also trying to install a phone line so the group can talk to their families but attempts to do so failed on Tuesday. Outside the cave, medics are staging rehearsals in case the group can be brought out soon.Other teams are still scouring the mountainside in the hope of finding another way into - and out of - the cave. The boys, aged between 11 and 16, and their 25-year-old coach went missing on 23 June. It is believed they entered the cave in northern Chiang Rai province when it was dry and that sudden heavy rains blocked the exit.It is thought they could at first move through parts of the cave in dry conditions but rushing waters clogged the narrow passages with mud and debris, blocking visibility and access.They were finally reached by two British rescue divers late on Monday, nine days after they entered the caves.They were huddled on a rock shelf about 4km (2.5 miles) from the mouth of the cave.The Brits who found the group aliveThe hours after the boys were foundThe video of that first contact was also posted on Facebook by Thai navy special forces.The boys are seen by torchlight sitting on a ledge above water, responding to the divers that all 13 are there and they are very hungry.Thailand rejoices as cave boys found aliveIn pictures: Thailand cave search"

520,Thailand cave rescue: What will the impact be on the boys' mental health?,"The case of 12 boys and their football coach who were found alive after being trapped in a cave in northern Thailand for nine days has gripped the world.Rescuers are now trying to work out how to safely get the group out of the cave, with the Thai military warning that the children could be trapped for up to four months.They have now received food and medical attention, but what will the impact of their ordeal be on their mental health?Dr Andrea Danese from King's College London is a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist at the National and Specialist CAMHS Trauma and Anxiety Clinic in London. He says that in the short term, many of the children facing such a traumatic incident may be fearful, clingy, jumpy or moody.But he says that the fact that the children are part of a community, in the form of their football team, will have been ""protective"" in terms of their mental health.What are the rescue options?Professor Donelson R. Forsyth, from the University of Richmond in Virginia, agrees. ""Previous cases suggest that the group will draw inward, marshalling its combined resources to survive, for if anyone can survive such a disaster, it is a group - and an organised one at that,"" he says.Although issues may arise within the group, with emotions such as blame, hopelessness, anger and issues of hierarchy coming to the fore, the group's background as a team may help the boys stay unified, he adds.This is a highly unusual situation, and even more so because unlike previous incidents such as the Chilean miners, who were trapped underground for almost 70 days in 2010, most of those involved in this case are children.Dr Danese emphasises the essential role that adults now have to play in helping the children coming to terms with their current situation, from their coach who is trapped with them, to rescue divers and medical staff.He says that ""clear and honest"" communication with the children will be essential in minimising any potential trauma.""It is important that they have information on what is going to happen,"" he says, pointing out that any unpredictability may increase any negative long-term impact on their mental health.The children should also be encouraged to speak about their feelings and avoid hiding their emotions.Contact with their families will also help to raise the boys' morale, and work is already under way to install telephone lines in the cave.In the meantime, divers are able to keep the group company.One of the group's major challenges in adjusting to the cave where they are trapped will have been the darkness.Without enough light to distinguish between night and day, the body clock, or circadian rhythm, ""drifts out of sync"", according to Professor Russell Foster, chair of Circadian Neuroscience at Oxford University.This won't just have an impact on their sleeping patterns, as the circadian rhythm also affects mood, gut function and many other areas of the human body.However, Professor Foster believes rescue teams will try to install lighting within the caves to mimic the night and day cycle, as happened with the Chilean miners.In addition to preventing jet lag once they return to the surface, the timed exposure to light will help the group to develop a daily routine as far as possible given their difficult circumstances, something Dr Danese says will offer them ""some idea of normality"". The impact of their experiences in the cave is likely to stay with the children long after their eventual rescue.Professor Sandro Galea, dean and Robert A Knox Professor at Boston University's School of Public Health, says that children who experience a trauma on this scale ""have a high risk of medium to long-term mood disorders"", such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.This does not mean that all of the boys will develop mood disorders, but he says it would be expected that ""a third to a half"" of the group could experience mental health issues.Of these, a third could experience long-term problems, Professor Galea says, which with the right help is treatable, including with Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and medication.But one of the factors that will be most important underground - namely, the group's relationships with each other and the outside world - will play a very significant role in their long-term recovery."
521,Thailand cave: 'Zero risks' to be taken in rescue of boys,"Rescuers will take no risks in freeing the 12 boys and their football coach trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand, an official said.They have received their first food and medical treatment in 10 days.Seven divers, including a doctor and a nurse, joined the group inside the caves in the north of the country after they were discovered alive on Monday. Rescuers are now considering how best to bring the group to safety.""We will not rush to take the lads out of the cave,"" the governor of Chiang Rai, Narongsak Osoththanakorn, told reporters, adding: ""Whoever has zero risk first can leave the cave first.""How will the boys cope underground?What are the rescue options?More heavy rain could see water levels rise and threaten the air pocket where the group has taken refuge.The boys were found nine days after they entered the caves in Chiang Rai province following a football training session and became trapped by rising waters from heavy rainfall.On Tuesday, Thai officials told reporters that rescuers were providing health checks and treatment, and keeping the boys entertained, adding that none of those trapped were in a serious condition.""They have been fed with easy-to-digest, high-energy food with vitamins and minerals, under the supervision of a doctor,"" Rear Admiral Apagorn Youkonggaew, head of the Thai navy's special forces, told reporters.It is believed that most of the group cannot swim, complicating what would already be a difficult rescue.Thailand rejoices as boys foundThe Brits who found the group aliveThe hours after the boys were foundEarlier, the Thai military said the boys would need to learn to dive - or wait up to four months for flooding to recede before they could get out of the caves, meaning food would need to be supplied for that time.Interior Minister Anupong Paojinda later stressed the urgency of the evacuation, adding that rain was forecast ""in the next few days"", the Bangkok Post reported. Attempts are being made to reduce the risk of further flooding of the caves by pumping water from the underground system, Mr Anupong said.A phone line is also being installed so the boys can talk to their families.The governor said that requests had been made to build ""infrastructure"" in the cave leading to the pocket where the teenagers and their coach are located.The Thai authorities have appealed for donations of full-face scuba diving masks small enough to fit the boys in order to reduce the risk of their breathing apparatus coming loose as they travel through flooded passageways. Two British rescuer divers who had flown over to join the search operation found the boys on Monday night. The video of that first contact was posted on Facebook by Thai navy special forces.The boys are seen by torchlight sitting on a ledge above water, responding to the divers that all 13 were there and that they were very hungry.They ask how long they have been underground and whether they can leave now. The divers tell them they have to wait, but say people will come back for them.One boy replies: ""Oh. See you tomorrow.""The search for the group had gripped the nation as it was unclear where they were or whether they were even still alive. Families of the missing group were ecstatic at news of their discovery. Thailand's Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said of the boys' discovery that ""everybody is a hero"".""Thank you all Thais, thank you all foreigners,"" he said.The boys, aged between 11 and 16, and their 25-year-old coach went missing on 23 June. It is believed they entered the cave when it was dry and sudden heavy rains blocked the exit.They were found on a rock shelf about 4km (2.5 miles) from the mouth of the cave.It is thought the boys could move through parts of the cave in dry conditions but rushing waters clogged the narrow passages with mud and debris, blocking visibility and access.One of the toughest stretches for the divers came as they neared the so-called Pattaya Beach - an elevated mound in the cave complex - where it was hoped the boys had sought refuge. Divers had to navigate a series of sharp, narrow bends in near-darkness. They completed the difficult journey to find Pattaya Beach flooded, so swam on and found the boys about 400m away. Bringing the trapped boys to safety is an extremely dangerous task given the conditions inside. The Tham Luang cave complex is regularly flooded during the rainy season which lasts until September or October.Experts have cautioned that taking inexperienced divers through the dangerous corridors of muddy, zero-visibility waters would be very risky.How will rescuers free the Thai boys?What to do to survive undergroundThai boys 'could be in cave for months'Nine days of hope - images from the searchDiver Ben Reymenants, who is assisting with the rescue mission, told the BBC that two Thai navy doctors had volunteered to stay with the boys for ""up to four months"" until the water receded.  Other teams are still scouring the mountainside in the hope of finding another way into the cave. The 12 boys are all members of a local football team and their coach is known to have taken them on occasional excursions and field trips. Tinnakorn Boonpiem, whose 12-year-old son Mongkol is among the 13, told Agence France-Presse she was ""so glad"" to hear they were safe.""I want him to be physically and mentally fit,"" she said.""I'm so happy I can't put it into words,"" another relative of one of the group told reporters as tears of joy streamed down his cheeks."
522,Thailand cave rescue: The Brits who helped find the boys,"The first voice 12 young Thai footballers and their coach heard after nine days trapped in caves was that of Briton John Volanthen.""How many of you?"" he asked. ""Thirteen? Brilliant.""It meant that, finally, they had been found.Mr Volanthen and Richard Stanton were in the cave after being called in by Thai authorities along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.The trio arrived in Thailand three days after the football team went missing. More than 1,000 people have been involved in the operation, from all over the world.The British Cave Rescue Council (BCRC) - the body for voluntary underground rescue in the British Isles - said it has been in contact with the British divers since their return.Bill Whitehouse, the council's vice chairman, said the men had described the dive as ""gnarly"" in an email, meaning there were complications and problems.Thai cave search: As it happenedHow to survive undergroundThailand shows love for trapped boysIt was a three-hour round trip, involving a 1.5km passage, partly flooded and partly open, he told BBC's Breakfast.On hearing the boys had been found, Mr Whitehouse said: ""It was really quite a moment, I can tell you.""However, he said that ""moment of euphoria"" for the divers and the boys would have been followed by: ""Now what?""Mr Volanthen and Mr Stanton are part of the South and Mid Wales Cave Rescue Team.""Both John and Rick have been involved in a good number of rescues over the years, and they've both got an awful lot of personal expertise to take to Thailand,"" the team's chairman, Gary Mitchell, said.In France in 2010 the pair were part of a team which attempted to rescue a trapped diver.Mr Stanton, a retired firefighter from Coventry, was also involved in the rescue of six British cavers in Mexico in 2004.During that rescue Mr Stanton was able to persuade one of the group - who was terrified of water - to make a 180-metre dive out of the cave, the West Midlands Fire Service said.In a 2007 interview, he said he became interested in diving after watching a programme called ""Underground Eiger"" as a child. He joined caving and diving clubs at university.Speaking to the BBC in 2004 he described the difficulties of navigating caves: ""When people landed on the moon they had a map, they knew where they were going but in a cave if you're beyond the known limit of the cave, nobody knows where it goes, you never know what will happen round the corner.""Mr Stanton was made an MBE in the New Year's Honours List at the end of 2012 for his cave diving rescue services. Mr Volanthen is an IT consultant based in Bristol but who grew up in Brighton.He started caving as a scout. Speaking to the Sunday Times in 2013, he said cave rescue requires a calm head.""Panic and adrenaline are great in certain situations - but not in cave-diving,"" he said. ""The last thing you want is any adrenaline whatsoever.""He added: ""It [cave diving] is like that puzzle with the fox, the chicken and the grain. It's not dangerous if you do it right."" According to an online profile, Mr Volanthen runs marathons and ultra-marathons. He joked that ""he only runs so he can eat more biscuits"".His mother Jill said she felt ""absolute pride"" over her son's role in the rescue effort in Thailand.Martyn Farr, a friend of both Mr Stanton and Mr Volanthen, described them as ""calm, very collected, very organised and extremely disciplined, consummate professionals.""Jon Whiteley, rescue controller for the Devon Cave Rescue Organisation, said the men were ""risk averse individuals"" who were ""at the top of their game"".He also said they were humble and despite the media interest would want to ""get back to their normal lives, normal day jobs and their families"". In 2012, both men received a Royal Humane Society medal at Buckingham Palace, in recognition of their rescue attempt in France.The third British expert, Robert Harper, has been caving since 1968."

525,Thailand rescue: Who are South and Mid Wales rescue team?,"One of the first voices heard by 12 young boys and their football coach trapped in a cave in Thailand was that of John Volanthen.A member of South and Mid Wales rescue team, Mr Volanthen, and divers Richard Stanton and Robert Harper, had been called to help with a rescue operation. More than 1,000 people across the world have been involved.But what is the South and Mid Wales rescue team, and why were they called in to help? The Brits who helped find the boysThai cave search: As it happenedThailand clings to hope for boys trapped in cave""There are various dive rescue groups across the globe but I would go as far to say that we are one of the top,"" Gary Mitchell, chairman of the team said. ""A lot of that is down to the fact that the UK is a hot bed for cave exploration, so we have a lot of experience.""The Thai people don't really do caving. It's such a specialist field. There are about 20,000 divers active in the UK and that's it. It's not a massive sport.""The charity was set up in 1946 to support cavers exploring caves in Swansea and Neath. Over the past 60 years and with the discovery of major cave systems across south Wales, the team's area of responsibility has expanded to cover Dyfed Powys and Gwent too. The role of the team has also evolved - in recent years they have attended road accidents and animal rescues, provided technical support to mountain rescue teams, and even assisted police in the search for a murder weapon in Brecon in 2001. The team has a wide range of expertise and also assisted in the search for April Jones in Machynlleth in 2012. Wales remains one of the more popular areas when it comes to attracting divers, Mr Mitchell says. ""There is somewhere in the region of 14 rescue teams across the UK, but we have some of the largest caves in the world in South Wales alone,"" he added. ""We have a cave around 90km long, and some of the deepest in the world so it's great for various dive training scenarios, and for people who have that passion for exploring.""Our guys have that built in.""Both John and Rick have been involved in a good number of rescues over the years, and they've both got an awful lot of personal expertise to take to Thailand. ""We were always very confident that we've got the best of our guys out there."" How to survive undergroundThailand cave rescue: Rescuers weigh boys' escape optionsJoy and relief as boys found aliveLeading exploratory cave diver and caver, Martyn Farr, said that the duo have had years of experience in South Wales and beyond. He said: ""John was called to a mining incident just a few years ago here in South Wales. A few years before that in 2014, the pair were called to a major incident in France where they attempted to rescue a diver. ""In 2004, Rick was responsible for rescuing a party of British cavers from a flooded cave in Mexico, so these guys have got a tremendous track record. ""They didn't know what they were going to be up against but when we heard that the waters were murky, I knew that the rescue authorities had called in the very best people for that task.""I am proud of them."""

I don't know how to describe it in words... it's unimaginable,"" the father of one of the boys said when he heard the news. ""I've been waiting for 10 days. I never imagined this day would come... I just want to see my son and hug him, that's more than enough.""Missing Thai boys found alive in cavesThe Brits behind the Thai cave boys searchAs it happened - the hours after the boys were foundAcross social media, there was an outpouring of relief and thanks, with many posting with the hashtag #13Survived.One picture imagined the group as boar piglets, a reference to the name of their football team, Moo Pa - or wild boars.""Everyone who helped the 13 people is a hero,"" said one user on Twitter. ""We are shedding tears of joy.""But though the boys, who are aged between 11 and 16, have been found - it might be a while before they are able to leave the cave.Thailand is currently in the midst of its rainy season, which lasts until September or October, so it could be months before floodwaters inside the cave recede. How can rescuers free the boys?If the children are to be brought out before then, they will have to learn basic diving skills.But experts have cautioned that taking inexperienced divers through the dangerous corridors of muddy, zero-visibility waters would be a very dangerous operation.If they are to wait until the water recedes by itself, it would mean the boys will have to stay in the cave for months and have to be continuously supplied with food and assistance.Rescuers are currently working to bring more supplies to them and they may need to have food sent in for at least the next four months, according to the military."
529,Thailand cave rescue: How can rescuers free the boys?,"After nine days trapped in darkness in a cave in Thailand, 12 boys and their football coach have been found alive.Two British divers found all 13 safe in a cavern in the Tham Luang cave system in the northern Chiang Rai province.But the issue now is to get them all out of the cave with rising waters and mud hindering access and the trapped group's health a major concern.The army says the group might have to wait in the cave for up to four months for floods to recede.So what are the options to free the youngsters and their coach?Missing Thai boys found alive in cavesWhat to do to survive underground""The option to bring them out by diving is the quickest but it's also the most dangerous,"" Anmar Mirza, national co-ordinator of the US Cave Rescue Commission, told the BBC.Thai navy divers, three top British cave divers and US military personnel all attempted to find the boys. In total, more than 1,000 people have been involved in the operation, including teams from China, Myanmar, Laos and Australia.These skilled professional divers still needed several hours to get to the trapped group from the entrance, through tiny, debris-strewn passages and aided by round-the-clock water pumping efforts to try to clear the flood waters. And these boys are not trained divers.Edd Sorenson, regional co-ordinator in Florida for the International Underwater Cave Rescue and Recovery Organisation, told the BBC the diving option is ""extremely dangerous and hazardous"", saying he would consider it ""an absolute last resort"".""Having somebody in zero visibility that's not familiar with... that kind of extreme conditions, it's real easy and very likely that they would panic, and either kill themselves and/ or the rescuers.""Authorities have tried to drill holes in the cave walls to help drain some of the flood water - although the thick rock has hampered efforts.There have also been suggestions that drilling could be another way to get to the boys, and to help them out. But to even begin the process, new roads would need to be built up above the caves to accommodate the heavy drilling equipment needed to break through the rock. On top of that, Mr Mirza explains you would need to have conducted a survey of the caves and to know them back to front before you could start drilling - otherwise there would be little chance of digging a hole in the correct place for the boys and their coach. ""It sounds easy but it's actually very difficult,"" he says. ""It's a needle in a haystack problem.""In a press conference, Chiang Rai governor Narongsak Osottanakorn said they would continue to drain water out of the cave while sending doctors and nurses in to check the health of the boys and their coach.""If the doctors say their physical condition is strong enough to be moved, they will take them out from the cave,"" he said.But Mr Mirza says their health is a serious concern. ""After nine days without food, you have to watch their food intake,"" he says. People deprived of food can suffer ill-health effects if not properly reintroduced to food - sometimes as severe as heart failure or comas. Mr Mirza says if the group are on high ground, safe from flooding, and can be resupplied there that might be a good option for now. Their ill-health ""significantly compromises the rescue effort,"" he says.Mr Sorenson agrees. ""I think they would be better off bringing in food, water, filtration systems, oxygen if the air space needs it and requires it"", he says.""They have lights and hope now, so I think waiting it out, as long as they can get supplies in there to make them comfortable and warm and fed and hydrated.""The moment divers find Thai cave boysThais show their love for lost cave boysDrones, dogs, drilling and desperation"
530,Thailand cave rescue: Boys found alive after nine days,"Twelve boys and their football coach missing in caves in Thailand for nine days have been found by divers, in a drama that has gripped the nation.They were discovered by two British divers on a ledge in a cavern after a marathon search operation in the Tham Luang caves in Chiang Rai.The challenge now will be to extract the party safely, with rising water and mud impeding access. Families of the missing group were ecstatic at news of the rescue. Rescuers had hoped they would find safety on a ledge in an underground chamber nicknamed Pattaya Beach but they were found 400m (440 yards) away having moved to higher ground to avoid the rising water.How will rescuers free the Thai boys?The Brits behind the Thai cave boys searchAs it happened - the hours after the boys were foundThe two British rescuers are believed to be Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, who arrived in Thailand early last week.It took them several hours to reach the group on Monday.In video posted on Facebook by Thai Navy SEAL special forces, one can be heard speaking in English to the group, as they sit on a ledge above water in a cavern, picked out by torchlight.""How many of you?"" the rescuer asks.""Thirteen!"" comes the reply.""Thirteen?

""Where you come from?""""England. The UK.""""Oh. See you tomorrow.""The group's plight has gripped the country and led to an outpouring of support.The boys aged 11 to 16 and their coach went to explore the caves on 23 June.By Jonathan Head, BBC News, Tham LuangThere are scenes of jubilation here at the cave entrance - drowned out by the generators powering the water pumps and filling the air tanks for the dozens of divers whose persistence in the toughest of underground conditions has paid off. Now the authorities must figure out how to extract them. The first priority is to get them medical treatment and food where they are, to rebuild their strength. The whole country has watched every stage of this operation, holding its breath for what seemed an increasingly unlikely happy ending. They are not out yet but this is an uplifting breakthrough after the Thai government threw everything it could at the effort to save these boys' lives.The 12 boys are members of the Moo Pa - or Wild Boar - football team.Their 25-year-old assistant coach, Ekkapol Janthawong, is known to have occasionally taken them out on day trips - including a trip to the same cave two years ago.The youngest member, Chanin ""Titan"" Wibrunrungrueang, is 11 - he started playing football aged seven.Duangpet ""Dom"" Promtep, 13, is the team captain and said to be the motivator of the group. Tinnakorn Boonpiem, whose 12-year-old son Mongkol is among the 13, told AFP news agency near the caves she was ""so glad"" to hear they were safe.""I want to him to be physically and mentally fit,"" she said.""I'm so happy I can't put it into words,"" another relative of one of the group told reporters as tears of joy streamed down his cheeks.""They are all safe but the mission is not completed,"" Chiang Rai governor Narongsak Osottanakorn   told a press conference at the command centre at the cave entrance.""Our mission is to search, rescue and return. So far we just found them. Next mission is to bring them out from the cave and send them home.""The governor said they would continue to drain water out of the cave while sending doctors and nurses to dive into the cave to check the health of the boys and their coach.""If the doctors say their physical condition is strong enough to be moved, they will take them out from the cave,"" he said. ""We will look after them until they can return to school.""Edd Sorenson, a regional co-ordinator in Florida for the International Underwater Cave Rescue and Recovery Organisation, advises against trying to get the party out through the flooded caves using scuba gear.""That is extremely dangerous and hazardous, and I would consider that an absolute last resort,"" he told the BBC.""Having somebody in zero visibility that's not familiar with ... that kind of extreme conditions, it's real easy and very likely that they would panic, and either kill themselves and or the rescuers. ""So at this point, you know, I think they would be better off bringing in food, water, filtration systems, oxygen if the air space needs it and requires it, and at least they have lights and hope now, so I think waiting it out, as long as they can get supplies in there to make them comfortable and warm and fed and hydrated.""More than 1,000 people have already been involved in the operation, including teams from China, Myanmar, Laos, Australia and the US, as well as Britain."

533,Thailand cave: The successful search for lost boys,"On 23 June, 12 boys and their coach went to explore a cave after football practice in northern Thailand. Nine days later, all 13 have been found alive.A huge rescue operation involving the Thai Navy and Air Force finally managed to find the group deep within the cave system.Shortly after the group's bikes were found abandoned at the entrance last month, heavy rain sent torrents of water through the cave.Rescuers hoped that the boys aged 11 to 16 and their coach were alive deep inside the Tham Luang Nang Non cave. They hoped the group could find safety on a mound in an underground chamber, after being trapped by flood waters.A photo of one of the missing boys, Prachak Sutham, is shown on the phone of a Thai student, below.Thai Navy divers, along with four British cave divers and some US military personnel, worked hard to try to reach the deepest caverns of the Tham Luang Nang Non cave, the fourth longest in Thailand.British cave-diver Robert Charles Harper is seen exploring an opening in the mountain during the rescue operation, below.Industrial water pumps were used to reduce the water level inside the cave, but struggled against relentless rain.The entrance to the cave became flooded, with efforts shifted to finding other ways to access and reduce water in the cave, involving drilling through rock to drain water.Drones equipped with thermal cameras were used to detect possible access points and an underwater robot sent back information on the water depth and condition of the cave.Sniffer dogs were also used after smelling clothing belonging to the missing children.On Monday, shortly before they were found, rescuers said they believed they were less than 1km (0.6 miles) from where the boys may be, but were blocked by a narrow tunnel.The group's plight gripped the country and led to an outpouring of support and hope, along with press attention.Hundreds of volunteers joined the military and police in the search operation.Prayers and rituals took place for the missing group, including by a monk at an altar near the Tham Luang cave, below left.A hermit was photographed performing a ritual beside the road leading to Tham Luang cave (below right).On Saturday, an ethnic Akha shaman was seen at Khun Nam Nang Non Forest Park performing religious rituals to help the search, below.On Monday, ethnic Lisu tribespeople held a ritual involving a sacrificial chicken to appease the spirits of Tham Luang cave.Thai medical experts had said the group's survival depended on whether they can find fresh drinking water and they could survive for eight days without food.."

The group's plight has gripped the country and led to an outpouring of support and hope.Heavy rain - and the knowledge they were not equipped for a long stay underground - has led to fears that the boys and their coach might not survive.Drones, dogs, drilling and desperationThais show their love for lost cave boysWhat to do to survive undergroundRear Admiral Apakorn Yuukongkaew, commander of the Thai Navy Seals, said on Sunday that his divers had reached ""chamber three"" in the cave complex.They had been forced back from that location by rising floodwaters earlier in the week.From there they have to get to an area nicknamed ""Pattaya Beach"" after the well-known Thai beach resort city.""It is hard because it's dark and flooded. The most important thing for today is speeding up to reach the kids,"" he told reporters.They made further progress on Monday but now have to widen a section of flooded tunnel in order to reach the boys' possible location. The 12 boys are members of the Moo Pa - or Wild Boar - football team.Their 25-year-old assistant coach, Ekkapol Janthawong, is known to have occasionally brought them out on day trips - including a trip to the same cave two years ago.The youngest member, Chanin ""Titan"" Wibrunrungrueang, is 11 - he started playing football aged seven.Duangpet ""Dom"" Promtep, 13, is the team captain and said to be the motivator of the group. The club's head coach Nopparat Kantawong who did not join the group on their excursion, says he believes the boys, who dream of becoming professional football players in the future, will stick together.""I believe they won't abandon each other,"" he told media outlets. ""They will take care of each other.""As well as the Seals, a team of international cave diving experts is helping with the rescue, but they are facing intensely difficult conditions underground. Pumps are removing about 10,000 litres of water from the cave every hour but some sections are still flooded. There is almost zero visibility in those areas, so divers are making slow progress.  Provincial Governor Narongsak Osottanakorn told reporters on Monday morning that it had taken the team about eight hours to travel 600m.Underscoring the dangers of the rescue scene, he also said four volunteers had briefly gone missing on Wednesday after entering the cave without letting co-ordinators know.  Thai medical experts say the group's survival depends on whether they find fresh drinking water.They could survive eight days without food, Medical Services Department Director Dr Somsak Akkasilp said.But they were at risk from infection from unclean water or contact with an animal inside the cave, he added.Cave temperatures are believed to be between 20C and 25C (68F to 77F) and the porous limestone rock means there should be enough oxygen, although some caves in the region are known to contain bad air pockets with carbon dioxide.Messages the children sent before setting off to explore the cave on Saturday suggest they had taken torches and some food.WATCH: Soldiers search for new cave entranceRescuers have also been searching through jungle on the mountainside for alternative entrances to the caves.Experts have said there is a good chance the limestone cave does have other entrances."

538,"Thai cave rescue: Drones, dogs, drilling and desperation","Last Saturday, 12 young boys went to explore a cave with their coach after football practice in northern Thailand. Their bikes were found abandoned at the entrance and shortly after, heavy rain sent torrents of water through the cave.Over the past week, rescuers have been mounting an increasingly desperate search, in the hope the group are alive deep inside the cave but trapped by floodwaters. Here's what the operation, in the jungle-covered hills around Chiang Rai, involves:Thai navy divers have been trying to access the deepest caverns of the Tham Luang Nang Non cave, the fourth longest in Thailand. Four top British cave divers, along with some US military personnel, also joined the efforts. The divers are swimming through tiny spaces and cannot risk going too far into flooded passages or they risk running out of air. The search has been frustrated by rushing water and near darkness inside the cave. Debris and mud leaves divers with almost no visibility; they can only see a few centimetres in front of them. It's been described as like swimming through cold coffee. Powerful industrial water pumps, put in place to reduce the water level inside the cave, have struggled to combat relentless rains. With the entrance flooded, pumping was halted on Thursday and divers forced to stop their search intermittently.Rescue efforts shifted to finding other ways to access - and reduce water in - the cave. 'Come home': Thailand clings to hope for lost boys What you need to do to survive underground That has involved drilling through rock to drain water, so the divers could resume the search - although the thickness of the cave's wall has made this difficult. Another option would be to drill into the cave to create a new route to try to reach the boys.But finding an area on the densely jungle-covered and muddy mountainside for the heavy machinery required, while ensuring surrounding rock does not collapse, makes the idea of drilling a hole to access the cave an impractical one.Other technology has aided the massive human search effort which includes the military, police and hundreds of volunteers.  Drones equipped with thermal cameras have been flown over Tham Luang to detect possible access points. An underwater robot was deployed to send information back on the water depth and condition of the cave. No technology exists to scan for people deep underground.There are plans to send cameras down to try to work out the next step and potentially to make contact with the missing group. The animals have helped survey teams investigate the area above the cave complex, which is several kilometres long, searching for possible ways in. The dogs were brought to the site after smelling clothing belonging to the missing children, news agency AFP reported. Relatives of the missing have camped outside the cave since they went missing on 23 June. Thailand's Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha arrived at the site to speak with them on Friday. Dozens of ""survival boxes"" containing food, maps and mobile phones were to be sent into the cave on Friday, according to the police. They plan to drop the boxes into any openings they find in the limestone rock on the mountains above the caves, and, if they do not find the missing boys, to float them on underground rivers in the hope they might reach them. A police team was able to descend one such hole, discovered by two of the British caving team, and discovered a large chamber, which may take them into part of the cave complexPolice Col Kraiboon Sotsong told reporters the boxes contained a message telling whoever found it to float the box back out. ""The note says: 'If received, then reply and show on the map where you are. Everybody will quickly help.""When they are found, the operation to get the group out of the cave will be long. Experts say it could take weeks, if they are found alive, to bring them to safety. Heavy rains at this time of year mean long passages might well remain continuously flooded for months. Earlier in the week local officials said rescue teams were preparing to train the boys and their coach to use scuba gear, in case they had to dive out through flooded areas of the cave. But navigating their way out would be incredibly difficult and it's more likely food and supplies would be sent in while work continued to find another entrance. "
539,'Come home': Thailand clings to hope for boys trapped in cave,"Twelve young footballers and their coach have been trapped inside a cave in Thailand's Chiang Rai province for nearly a week.They went missing after apparently setting out to explore the Tham Luang Nang Non cave, accompanied by their 25-year-old coach.The huge search for the missing group - thought to have been cut off by rising floodwater - has gripped the country. Now Thais are turning to social media in an outpouring of support and hope. A hashtag, which translates to ""the strangers we want to meet the most"" is being used to convey the nation's concern for the group of boys, aged between 11 and 16. ""I'm waiting for 13 people to come back home,"" said this Thai user on Twitter. ""Come out. Everyone is waiting for you.""""I'm waiting to hear the words 'The search has come to an end, all 13 lives are safe',"" this Twitter user says.Some social media users shared a picture of the boys sitting on a wild boar. The boys were members of the Moo Pa soccer team, which directly translates to wild boar.They were said to have regularly visited the cave in the district of Mae Sai for training and recreation. During the rainy season, which lasts from June till October, the cave can flood up to 5m (16ft).Other hashtags which translate to phrases like ""13 lives must survive"" and ""Bring home the Moo Pa players"" were also trending. Another Twitter user shared an image of the boys in their football jerseys with the caption ""Let's meet soon"".Others also sent messages of support to the rescue team.With the main entrance to the cave flooded, professional divers, rescue workers and military personnel have been working to find an alternative way in.Water levels in the cave are continually rising, frustrating rescue efforts.It is not known where in the cave the group are trapped, though footprints have been found inside the cave complex, sparking hope that the boys are still alive.Messages the children sent before setting off to explore the cave on Saturday suggest they had taken torches and some food.""I've lost hope with people in this country, but not today. [This incident] makes me know this country always has hope,"" said one user on Twitter. ""The people in this country [have] left behind their prejudices and come together in every way they can, praying for kids to survive. I hope you're safe [boys]."""
540,Thai cave: Rising water stops divers searching for missing boys,"Rising water levels have interrupted efforts to find 12 teenagers and their football coach trapped in a cave in northern Thailand.Pumping was halted and with the entrance flooded, Thai navy divers had to stop their search.The boys aged 11 to 16 and their 25-year-old coach entered the cave on Saturday and there has been no contact with them since. The rescue operation is now focusing on finding another way into the cave. Thai authorities said they planned to drill a narrow shaft into the mountain to create an alternative entry point.More from the BBC team at the scene on TwitterExperts think there is a good chance the limestone cave does have other entrances. Spotting those in the vast forest-covered mountainside is extremely difficult though. It is not known, however, where in the cave the group are trapped nor even whether they are still alive. Messages the children sent before setting off to explore the cave on Saturday suggest they had taken torches and some food. Caving experts have told the BBC that as long as they are in a chamber above flood levels, they have a chance of survival.The biggest dangers for the children would be hypothermia or lack of oxygen. Cave temperatures are believed to be between 20C and 25C (68F to 77F) which is still relatively warm. Unless their clothes are wet, the temperatures are not thought to be a problem. The porous lime stone means there should be enough oxygen although some caves in the region are known to contain bad air pockets with carbon dioxide. What to do to survive undergroundTham Luang, Thailand's fourth longest cave, is known to be prone to flooding during the rainy season. The teenagers and coach are believed to have been cut off from the entrance by rising floodwaters. Rescue teams and volunteers have over the past days frantically tried to find a way into the cave, scouring the surrounding area for holes, but have failed to get through. By Jonathan Head, South East Asia correspondent, BBC NewsThe mud-caked car park which serves as a base for the search operation is more orderly now; vehicles are restricted, journalists must register for passes, and infrastructure is constantly being improved - new phone lines, power lines, and new pipes for pumping water out of the cave. But this only highlights how long this search is taking, and how limited the progress has been, with strain showing in the hitherto stoical faces of the families who have kept up their vigil for the 12 boys and their coach. We saw the first US military personnel bustled in and then out of the headquarters today - they are saying little about their role or capabilities. Two top British cave divers went into the main entrance to see if they could get further than the Thai navy divers, who have made little headway so far. Two other British cavers climbed the steep forested slopes on the other side of the mountain, and found a promising hole above a point they have explored inside the caves in the past; but it must still be probed by climbers with ropes. And even if they do find a way in, no-one knows if the trapped boys are in that part of the cave complex. Joshua Morris runs caving and climbing tours in northern Thailand and has two of his team assisting the rescue operations. He told the BBC there still is a chance the boys are alive. ""What flooded is a narrow passage about 2km (1.4 miles) into the cave. If the kids are on the other side of that, they might be in a higher chamber which is still dry,"" he explains. ""Being trapped in a cave like this is probably one of the most horrific things one could experience,"" he says. Usually, a team would have a lot of lights as well as food and water. It is unlikely the boys were at all prepared to spend more than a few hours in the cave. Even if they are found alive, the problem will be how to get them out of there. Strong rains during the summer mean a long stretch of the passage might well remain continuously flooded for months. ""Diving in a cave like this is very dangerous.,"" says Mr Morris. ""The water is moving, it's muddy and there is almost no visibility. That means the children - if found alive - might have to be supplied for longer time until the water can be brought back down.""On Wednesday, three British cave divers arrived in the city of Chiang Rai along with some US military personnel, to help the efforts. They are expected to go into the cave once the main entrance is accessible again.  ""Water is the biggest challenge,"" Sgt Kresada Wanaphum in the Thai army told Reuters. ""There is a lot of debris and sand that gets stuck while pumping."" As the search efforts enter their fifth day, Interior Minister Anupong Paojinda said officials were ""confident the children are still alive"".""They have food, they are skilful, we are confident they are safe."""
541,Thailand cave rescue: How would you survive in a cave?,"A desperate search is under way for a group of 12 teenage footballers and their coach who are believed to be trapped deep inside a cave in Thailand. Heavy rain has flooded the cave system, hindering the authorities' attempts to go in and find them.The hope is that the group have found a safe, high place to await rescue, but unlike professional cavers, they were not equipped for a long stay.We spoke to cavers about what you need to do to survive when trapped underground. They emphasised the need to keep warm and hydrated, and stay out of danger.Anmar Mirza, national co-ordinator of the US National Cave Rescue Commission, says the first thing to do is make sure you're not in any immediate danger. Rockfalls pose a risk, but the major worry is flooding.""You want to seek the highest point in the cave,"" Mr Mirza said. His advice is to try to guess where water had risen to in previous floods. ""There's a number of ways to determine that point - look for mud, leaves, wet slime on the walls.""Then, you want to check what supplies you have with you.Depending on how long you are in the cave, you may be forced to ration food, water, and even light.The first major risk, Mr Mirza says, is hypothermia. ""Wring out clothes to keep them dry,"" he says, ""and huddle together for warmth.""Andy Eavis, retired head of the British Caving Association, says thankfully hypothermia probably won't be a big issue in the Thai cave system.""The ambient temperatures will be fairly high,"" he says, estimating them to be between 23-26C (73-79F).Mr Eavis, 70, has been exploring caves for the past 50 years, including some in Thailand, Myanmar and China - although not the cave system in which the teenagers and their coach are trapped.He says many of these caves are huge - some big enough to be explored ""with aeroplanes"" - and doesn't think they're likely to flood to the roof.""If they're sitting out of the water, they won't die of hypothermia,"" he says.Mr Eavis describes being trapped in a cave in the Pyrenees with two other cavers, where the water was about 2C (36F).""We were there for 55 hours,"" he said. ""But thankfully, we were wearing wetsuits.""After warmth, Mr Mirza says, the next major concern is water.""Keep yourself hydrated, but beware of dirty water in the cave,"" Mr Mirza says. ""It's a balancing act - diarrhoea and vomiting would make dehydration a bigger problem later.""Even if the water is dirty, it won't pose an immediate problem, says Mr Eavis. ""Most cave waters are reasonably drinkable,"" he says. ""It might cause upset tummies though.""Bill Whitehouse, retired chairman of the British Cave Rescue Council, recommends looking around the cave. ""Little drips and inlets may have fresher water,"" he says. ""But long term, food will be the problem.""Mr Mirza agrees. ""If you have food, make sure not to eat it all at once.""Oxygen is also a factor. However, all three men agree that this isn't as big a concern as you'd think.""Most caves naturally breathe,"" Mr Mirza says. ""Air can get in and out where people can't.""The cave divers who went back for their friendsTwo days in an underwater cave running out of oxygen Carbon dioxide levels can rise if people are trapped in such a small space for so long. But for the most part, the rescuers agree lack of air isn't a major problem.""In general, it's not uncommon for oxygen levels to be slightly low in caves,"" says Mr Whitehouse. ""But not seriously low. It depends on the cave.""You may have all the supplies to survive, but keeping calm in the dark can be difficult.""I always tell people it's a marmite sport,"" says Mr Whitehouse. ""Underground is one of those places you're either happy or you're not.""""Don't panic,"" says Mr Eavis. ""Panicking and trying to get out come what may is the biggest risk.""For the Thai teenagers, a lot of pressure will be on whoever is in charge to stop them from trying to dive into the waters, which could be dangerous.""The leader will have to really control them to stop them doing anything silly, like dive in,"" he said.""It's mentally very taxing being in the dark.""Mr Mirza says lighting is not as problematic as it once was.""Experienced cavers will have hundreds of hours of light with them - modern LEDs, lithium batteries.""But in the case of the teenagers in Thailand, it could be an issue.""We're not talking about cavers here. They're probably not well equipped,"" says Mr Whitehouse. As a rule, if you're going to enter a cave, you should always be prepared, Mr Whitehouse says.""Get the right information, get the right kit, and go with someone who knows the cave,"" he says.The veteran cave rescuer also says a vital point is to tell someone where you are going before you go.""The earlier we get the callout the sooner something can be done,"" he says."

Jonathan Head, BBC News, Tham LuangNavy divers have been trying to reach the deepest caverns, and turning the area around the caves into a sea of mud. Weary, rain-soaked rescuers can be seen coming to and from the cave entrance, where medical teams are waiting, in the hope that the missing boys may be found. Family members pray around makeshift shrines.They have brought in pumps to try to reduce the water level, but so far have only been able to use them outside the caves, where their efforts are being thwarted by the rain. They are now reeling power cables into the caves to help the divers with better light, and to use the pumps there. They have also tried using drones. So far the only sign of the missing boys is the bicycles they left, which are still locked to the fence at the cave entrance, and some handprints spotted by divers who reached one of the largest underground chambers on Monday.The team and their coach are believed to have entered the Tham Luang Nang Non cave on Saturday afternoon.Rescue workers began searching for them on Saturday night after they were reported missing. The search was briefly halted but navy divers were able to re-enter the cave early Tuesday. Large squads of soldiers have been brought in to see if they can get access from the hills above the caves. There are also dozens of volunteers with more experience of cave diving and exploration. According to the Bangkok Post, visitors must cross a small stream to enter the cave, making it inaccessible if the stream floods. The cave can flood up to 5m (16ft) during Thailand's rainy season, which runs from June to October.Rescue teams were preparing to train the team to use scuba gear, in case they had to dive out through areas of the cave which were completely submerged, according to local officials.

According to the Bangkok Post newspaper, visitors must cross a small stream to enter Tham Luang Nang Non, making it inaccessible if the stream floods.Police Colonel Komsan Saardluan told AP news agency that the cave can flood up to 5m (16ft) during Thailand's rainy season, which runs from June to October. The group of teenagers and their 25-year-old coach are believed to have entered the cave on Saturday afternoon.Rescue workers began searching for them on Saturday night after they were reported missing. They found bicycles along with sports equipment outside the cave.Defence Minister General Prawit Wongsuwan said divers from the Royal Thai Navy reached the cave on Monday. Later, local TV quoted the province's deputy governor, Pasakorn Boonyalak, as saying he was confident the 13 were still alive after the divers found foot and hand prints on dry ground inside the cave in an area not reached by the water.Rescue teams were preparing to train the team to use scuba gear, in case they had to dive out through areas of the cave which were completely submerged, he added.Mr Pasakorn said helicopters had dropped food and water into a tunnel which residents of a village said gave access to the cave system, as well as handwritten notes instructing the group to wait for the rescuers, who would try to get to them there."

548,Thai king takes control of some $30bn crown assets,"Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn has been granted full, personal ownership of royal assets thought to be worth at least $30bn (£22bn). The Crown Property Bureau, which controlled the royal fortune on behalf of the monarchy, said it transferred ownership of the assets following a change in the law last year.It means taxes are liable on royal assets for the first time.Maha Vajiralongkorn, 65, became king in December 2016.He succeeded his much-revered father King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who was the world's longest-reigning monarch when he died in October 2016.Thailand has strict lese majeste laws, which ban criticism of the monarchy. The laws have also shielded the royal family from public view and scrutiny.Profile: King Maha VajiralongkornThailand's lese-majeste law explained The Crown Property Bureau said in a statement it was required ""to return whatever asset of the Crown property previously under its charge, to His Majesty so that His Majesty may take decisions on all matters pertaining to their charge and management at his discretion"".The assets include shares in various companies. The statement went on to say: ""His Majesty made the decision to make the 'Crown Property Assets' be subject to the same duties and taxation as would assets belonging to any other citizen"".It also pledged to ensure the management of assets would be ""transparent and open to scrutiny"".The Crown Property Bureau (CPB) has been managing royal assets since it was established in 1938 and, until now, has been run by at least four royally-appointed directors and included the minister of finance.The extent of the CPB's wealth is not known. In 2012, Forbes magazine estimated its value in property and other investments came to more than $30bn.Stock exchange data in March showed the king acquired a nearly $150m stake in Siam Cement Group Pcl and, in October, shares worth over $500m in Siam Commercial Bank were transferred to the king, Reuters news agency reports. Before becoming king, Maha Vajiralongkorn is reported to have spent a lot of time abroad and his colourful lifestyle occasionally made headlines in foreign media. Observers say he has worked hard to improve his profile in recent years, which is important as the king is traditionally seen as a guiding force in Thai politics."

550,Durian in space: Thailand to send smelly fruit into orbit,"Imagine being trapped in a spaceship with the world's smelliest fruit.Thailand's space research agency has just announced plans to send durian to space by July, as part of a project to produce Thai food suitable for future space travel.The baked durian will stay in space for five minutes before coming back to Earth, where scientists will see if it has undergone any textural changes.Durian, known for its strong, stinky smell, is native to South East Asia.According to local media reports, the fruit will be launched into space via a rocket.Thailand is not yet in the group of nations to have been to space, but they are making sure the catering is in place for future trips. ""Our main goal is to eventually bring Thai food up to space to be consumed by astronauts,"" a spokesman for the Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA) told the BBC. ""For a start, we chose durian, which is the king of fruits in Thailand. We'd like to send [it] to the atmosphere at the same level that astronauts live and bring them back to analyse their texture for any changes.""Rotten fruit causes university evacuationScientists find the durian's smelly secretThe spokesman said that if the project worked, the agency could ""bring other Thai food that is well known, like pad Thai or mango sticky rice, up to space for more tests"". Durian is well-loved in Thailand but are also found in countries like Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam.Its pungent smell is notoriously powerful - so much so that it is often banned from public transport and other enclosed spaces.The durian isn't the first regional delicacy to be sent into space.In 2008, a South Korean astronaut was sent into space along with kimchi, a fermented homemade cabbage dish that is widely seen as the national dish.Additional reporting by Thanyarat Doksone"

552,Crossing Divides: Thai orchestra fights bloodshed with music,"The 14-year conflict between Muslim insurgents and authorities in Thailand's three southernmost provinces has claimed more than 7,000 lives. But can music help bridge the sectarian divide?Watching news coverage of the repeated killings in southern Thailand led one city mayor to a depressing conclusion.""Every time a situation arises, there are two mindsets: if you're a Buddhist you will feel satisfied when a Muslim dies, and if you're a Muslim it's the other way around,"" says Pongsak Yingchoncharoen.He was elected mayor of Yala in 2003, a year before tensions bubbled over in the three southern provinces that are home to two million people. Members of the region's Muslim majority burned down government schools they saw as symbols of an oppressive Buddhist Bangkok administration.Attempts to tackle the violence aggravated the situation and Pongsak grew concerned about the effects on youth in his city. ""Each day children see the images of people being killed on the side of the streets,"" Pongsak, a Buddhist, tells BBC Thai at his office. Across the wider Yala province, there were more than 5,000 violent incidents including shootings and bombings from 2004 to 2016, according to monitors from Deep South Watch.""We can sense the hatred between Buddhists and Muslims, and that kind of feeling is dangerous if children grow up with it,"" Pongsak adds.With peace talks yielding little progress, in 2007 Pongsak hit upon an unusual antidote to the death and destruction. He set up a youth orchestra, made up of children from both sides of the sectarian divide.Investing public funds in music was controversial when people were most concerned about security. It meant sending teachers for training in Bangkok and the first instruments were the cheapest available.But 120 students applied to join. The first performance was held on the birthday of the then King Bhumibol Adulyadej in December 2007, and thousands of people filled the hall to watch. ""First I wasn't confident about the performance, but when the royal anthem was played as the first song, I saw the confidence in the children. Yala people saw it too. It was a phenomenon that the people of Yala had never before experienced. I had tears in my eyes.""Today some 150 young people play regularly in the orchestra - and Pongsak says 650 have already graduated from the ensemble.Among the players is trumpeter Kasidach Chatree. He recalls one day, as a young boy, when he heard what he thought were firecrackers outside his house, in an upmarket area of central Yala.It turned out to be an attack that left his aunt, who had been cycling to deliver alms to local monks, with a head injury from flying shrapnel.""First I was afraid, and didn't leave the house often. But then I became used to [the attacks],"" says Kasidach, now 18. ""Sometimes I'm depressed and sad. I don't know who does these things and why.""But he says the orchestra has given him hope, and changed his outlook.""Talking to Muslims and learning the words in their language and their food - that's a new experience for me,"" he says.One of his Muslim colleagues is 18-year-old cellist Awatif Hayiwani. ""It feels very good whenever I play music. Especially when we play together, it's like creating harmony within the orchestra and everyone has to listen each other,"" she said.  Awatif follows a long list of cello players on Instagram, including her idol - French-born American cellist Yo-Yo Ma. But when she first brought up her musical dream, her mother wasn't convinced.""She explained that our religion prohibits the playing of musical instruments and listening to music,"" recalls Awatif.The teenager eventually talked her round but not many of Awatif's friends have been as successful at convincing their families to let them play alongside non-Muslims. About three-quarters of the orchestra's players are Buddhist, and almost all are young men.For some, the suggestion that music is against Islamic teachings is open to interpretation.Hadee Hamidong, a Muslim, has organised acoustic concerts in neighbouring Pattani province, bringing Muslim and Buddhist together in a public space. Using social media to publicise the events, he drew in crowds of 500 music fans from both religions.""When we speak of music, the first thing we have in mind is a man and woman falling in love. We think of romance and flirting,"" Hadee says. ""But music is a cultural power. It can be about hard issues - and so we try to choose songs that are not related to teenage love. Art and music are tools to bring together people to talk and exchange ideas,"" he says.Yala youth orchestra has toured widely, and the model has been replicated in Bangkok, and regions in the north and south. Despite this, the bloodshed in Yala province continues. In January, three civilians died and more than 30 were wounded in a deadly motorcycle bombing at a market in Yala city. Mathus Anuvatudom, an academic at King Prajadhipok's Institute's Office of Peace and Governance, points out that classical music doesn't have a mass appeal, which is one of the reasons why the orchestra isn't as successful as it might be.However, he says it succeeds as a symbol of harmony, adding: ""People see that they [Muslims and Buddhists] are able to play together.""Conductor Weerasak Aksornteang, who has led the orchestra since its inception, imagines a future where music can create a better society. ""If we do this for another 10 to 20 years, let's say around 50% come back to work in Yala. And if these 500 people who used to play music together, who went through good experiences together, work in different organisations, I think that will make the city a much better place to live in,"" he says.Photographs by Panumas Sanguanwong of BBC ThaiCrossing Divides: a week of stories about people creating connections in a polarised world.Learning to love school in a foreign landThe Hindus and Sikhs helping build a mosqueDialogue - and drums - across bitterest of dividesCrossing Divides on BBC World ServiceAbout Crossing DividesDo you have experience of building bridges within divided communities?

553,Thailand protesters in rare rally over Chiang Mai development,"Protesters in Thailand have staged one of the country's biggest demonstrations since the 2014 military coup as they campaign against a luxury housing development on forested land.More than 1,000 people gathered in the northern city of Chiang Mai.They rallied against a housing project being built for judges and officials in the foothills of a sacred mountain.The march went ahead in defiance of a ban on public gatherings imposed by the junta, which seized power in 2014.""Around 1,250 people took part in the protest,"" Police Colonel Paisan, deputy commander of Chiang Mai Police, told Reuters news agency.""The protesters were focused on environmental issues and not politics, and they cleaned the street afterwards."" Demonstrators, many wearing green ribbons, demanded the dismantling of new buildings that encroach into the mountain, Doi Suthep. The forested area contains a popular temple and is considered by some to be sacred. They gave the government seven days to comply or face more protests. Thai PM releases new pop songThailand announces 2018 electionPM leaves cutout to answer questionsThailand: Land of military coupsBut the authorities have defended the development, insisting it was erected legally on government-owned land that does not infringe on the national park covering the rest of the mountain. About 1 billion baht ($32 million; £23 million) has been spent on the project, which includes offices as well as housing, and it is nearly complete, according to the Bangkok Post. Anger over the construction comes amid growing frustration about special treatment for Thai elites and officials."

Live updates from the East MidlandsCapt Watcharapol Pimwong, from Dech Udom police, in the Ubon Ratchathani province, said after attacking his wife, Mr Smitham left her body outside the house where they had been staying.He told the BBC that the 51-year-old was ""very angry"" because he thought she was having an affair.Mrs Smitham's aunt found her body covered with a cloth on Monday morning and then reported it to police.Mr Watcharapol said Mr Smitham was charged with ""assaulting that causes death or other."" If found guilty, he could face a 20 year jail term, according to Thai law. He has been transferred to Ubon Ratchathani's provincial prison and is awaiting trial, the BBC understands.A spokesman for the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) said: ""Our staff are in contact with the Thai police following the arrest of a British man.  ""We are providing advice and information to him and his family."""
556,Tourism pressures: Five places tackling too many visitors,"In recent weeks, authorities in Thailand and the Philippines have called time on tourism in two of their most popular tourist destinations.First, Thai officials said Maya Bay needed an enforced break from the daytrippers who have flocked there since it was featured in 2000 film The Beach.Then Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte announced that Boracay Island will also be closing for a few months, having, in his words, become an overcrowded ""cesspool"".Thai beach from DiCaprio film to closePhilippines to shut popular tourist islandIs Skye reaching the limit for tourists?And these are not the only ones. Various European cities, including Venice and Dubrovnik, have also complained of being swamped by visitors, as has the Isle of Skye in Scotland. In 2017, Barcelona launched a crackdown on unlicensed accommodation rented via the AirBnB network, saying it was pushing up rental costs for locals. Other places have hiked up fees for visitors to protect their assets. Rwanda now charges $1,500 (£1,000) a day for a gorilla-watching permit. Here we take a look at five destinations around the world figuring out ways of dealing with their own popularity. In March, Thai authorities announced they were closing the country's famed Maya Bay to allow it a brief respite. The secluded cove - with translucent waters, white sands and limestone cliffs - shot to fame as the picturesque setting for The Beach, starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Since then between 4,000 and 5,000 visitors have been turning up on its shores daily.Experts have said 77% of Maya Bay's coral is at serious risk, mainly from damage by boat anchors. The planned four-month break this year - from June to September - cannot fix that. So, is it too late to save Maya Bay? Bangkok-based marine scientist Thon Thamrongnawasawat does not think so. ""If we thought it was too late, we would do nothing,"" he told the BBC. ""We closed one island, called Koh Yoong, three years ago, and the corals there are growing very well. We will use the same practice in Maya Bay and try to transplant some coral as well.""Thailand closed dozens of dive sites to tourists in 2011. Koh Yoong, in the Phi Phi island chain and Koh Tachai, in the Similan Islands National Park, have also been off-limits to visitors since mid-2016.Elizabeth Becker, author of Overbooked: The Exploding Business of Travel and Tourism, said: ""I think it makes sense to close islands. However, there are huge economic pressures on Thailand, especially during these difficult political times. Tourism has been key to Thailand's economic development so Thai businesses and officials are afraid any curtailment of tourism would imperil the Thai economy.""Mr Thamrongnawasawat thinks this is why it has taken so long to take action at Maya Bay. ""If you are in a country that earns more than 22% of GDP from tourism, you will understand how hard this was. Most people did not think this could really happen."" When Maya Beach reopens, it will have a new daily limit of 2,000 tourists a day and boats will no longer be allowed to cross the shallow reef. It will also close again for four months next year. However, Worapoj Limlim, the head of the area's national park, told the Phuket News that he was not sure how he would enforce the new ban, and he might need back-up to add to the small team that already patrols the shores. Tourists cannot get enough of the five brightly painted cliffside towns in northern Italy known as Cinque Terre. The area, which has about 5,000 residents, became a national park in 1999 and now receives more than two million tourists per year. People come to hike the scenic paths that link the towns and the terrace vineyards. Over the years, the walkways have fallen into disrepair from erosion and overuse.The popular route between the towns of Riomaggiore and Manarola has been closed since September 2012, after a group of Australian tourists was injured in a landslide. Another hiker on a different path was hurt during 2018's Easter weekend, according to La Nazione news site. There has been plenty of talk about imposing a limit on the number of visitors, but that has not yet happened. Cruise tourists overwhelm Europe's ancient resortsHundreds protest against Venice touristsLately, park authorities have been trialling an app which tourists can download to see the number of people on the routes in real time. When a red warning sign shows, a path is overcrowded and visitors can then make up their minds if they want to join the throngs. In the future, they may trial virtual waiting lists. Visitors are also encouraged to buy a Cinque Terre Card, which allows access to trails and public transport. It is not obligatory but the proceeds go towards trail repairs, among other things. Richard Hammond, who runs GreenTraveller.com, told the BBC now was the best time for change across the world. ""People are becoming more aware of how they are travelling and how they are living,"" he said. ""For example, there is suddenly more widespread awareness of plastic usage - only in the last year - and this is spilling over into other areas of people's lives, making it more palatable to make changes. The way is open for governments and local authorities to act because they won't have the backlash that they had in the past."" Peru's ancient Inca citadel of Machu Picchu is on the must-see list for many keen travellers.Its famous Inca Trail allows visitors to hike their way there - through Andean landscapes and cloud forests - which many say is an even more fulfilling experience.However, too many people and too many informal operators were leading to damaged routes, rubbish pile-ups and out-of-control campsites. In 2005, the Peruvian government placed a limit on the number of people allowed to hike the trail per season. It is also closed every February for cleaning and maintenance.Tourists have adapted by booking ahead, and tour companies have to abide by regulations to keep their allocated permits.   However, visitors still flood through Machu Picchu itself, which, for the vast majority of people, is accessed by road. Last year, the authorities brought in new system, which involves buying a ticket for either the morning or the afternoon, in a bid to control the numbers. However, one local environmentalist told the BBC they feared this was just a quick fix. The site is known to be surpassing Unesco's recommended cap of a maximum of 2,500 visitors per day.Can you guess the busiest flight route in the world?Last year, it was between South Korea's capital, Seoul, and Jeju island, a tourist destination about 90km off the mainland. People come to take in the volcanic landscapes, picturesque waterfalls - and an erotic amusement park, which is popular with honeymooners. In 2017, almost 65,000 flights went between these two airports, working out at almost 180 per day. Annually, about 15 million tourists visit the island, according to the South China Morning Post.  That is a lot of people for an area under 2,000 sq km (700 sq miles). Kang Won-bo, director of a local protest group, told the Korea Times: ""[Jeju's] once-pristine environment has been seriously damaged after it became popular with outsiders. There is more trash and traffic jams.""Speaking to the BBC, Catherine Germier-Hamel, a sustainable tourism consultant based in Seoul, said: ""The island is also receiving lots of cruise visitors, who just stay a few hours and do not really contribute to the local economy."" Ms Germier-Hamel said that across the world, people tended to measure tourism success purely in terms of the number of arrivals, and this needed to change. South Korea tourism hit by China banAnd how about the carbon footprint from all those flights? It does not look like it will be addressed anytime soon: the South Korean government is considering another airport in southern Jeju, which it thinks could triple the annual number of tourists to 45 million by 2035.Jeju Island is also particularly popular with Chinese tourists. The growth of the Chinese travel market is viewed as causing major new strains across the region.However, in the case of Jeju Island, things took an odd turn last year when China banned its travel agencies from selling package tours to South Korea in protest at Seoul's decision to utilise a US-made missile defence system, which Beijing saw as a threat to its security. That ban has now been lifted. Colombia's Caño Cristales is a surreal site - a river that appears to run a whole spectrum of colours. Thanks to aquatic plants and tricks of the light, it ripples red, pink, lime green and yellow. Locals in the central Meta province call it the liquid rainbow.This was formerly the heart of territory occupied by Farc guerrillas, meaning tourism - both foreign and domestic - was pretty much non-existent.Remote Colombian island’s airport conundrumBut in recent years - especially after the 2016 peace deal was signed - visitors have started to venture into the country's inner depths and see this much-photographed wonder for themselves, using the tiny town of Macarena as their base.   Caño Cristales does not see anywhere near the same amount of visitors as some of the other places on this list (about 16,000 in 2016), but does have a tough task of balancing an unprecedented influx with an extremely delicate ecosystem. There are concerns that more people in the area might risk an increase in pollution and damage the precious aquatic plants.Unusually for an emerging destination, it has started off on the right foot by instigating a number of rules: no plastic bottles, no sunscreen or insect repellent in the water, no swimming in certain areas, no cigarettes, no feeding the fish. On arrival, visitors attend a briefing to ensure all of this is entirely clear.Henry Quevedo, president of the Caño Cristales tourist board, said tourism here was very much a local project, with hundreds of families playing a role acting as tour guides and hosts. They are now undergoing training and learning other languages. However, there are still environmental concerns over a possible increase in flights (visitors typically arrive from Bogotá, 170 miles to the north) and SUVs, which drive people from the town of Macarena to the river itself.In December, access was restricted to give the river a break. Faber Ramos, co-ordinator of the ecotourism program, told news site Semana Sostenible: ""Human presence can harm the plants' reproduction processes. That's why we decided to implement the restriction.""'I was a teacher for 17 years - but I couldn't read'Secrets of a world record-breaking 'fairy cave'The woman still protesting over Martin Luther KingAll photographs copyright of Alamy, Getty Images and Shutterstock"

558,Thai women reject Songkran advice with 'don't tell me how to dress' campaign,"When a Thai government official told women to dress carefully to prevent harassment at the Songkran festival, it brought back painful memories for model Cindy Sirinya Bishop. The Thai-American was just 17 when she was sexually harassed at the New Year celebrations. Dressed in a loose black t-shirt and three-quarter shorts, Ms Bishop found herself cornered by five men after she was separated from her friends.""They surrounded me and tried touching me. I just ran and managed to get away from them. I haven't been to Songkran since,"" Ms Bishop told the BBC. The three-day festival, which begins on Friday, is marked by the pouring of water to symbolise washing away misfortune from the previous year. What is Songkran?Last month Sutthipong Chulcharoen, Thailand's director general of the department of local administration, encouraged women to dress appropriately to prevent sex crimes during the water festival. In response, Ms Bishop posted some clips on Instagram - along with the hashtags #DontTellMeHowToDress and #TellMenToRespect - and found plenty of people shared her dismay. The 39-year-old said the hashtags were ""targeting the idea that women are to blame for sexual harassment"". It wasn't long before other women began sharing their own stories. ""I was out with a friend and a female cousin [during Songkran], wearing a turtle-necked top, sweat pants and a sweater because I get cold easily,"" said one user on Twitter. After losing track of her friends, she quickly found herself surrounded by a group of boys. ""They started to corner me... one of the guys grabbed my arm. I burst into tears. Thank god my cousin and friends came back so everything was alright. Since then, I've never gone out on Songkran.""The hidden dangers in Thailand's Songkran festivalThailand tones down SongkranOther Thai women began to share their experiences from everyday life that led to harassment. ""I once wore shorts to a 7-11 store near my house and a security guard looked at my legs and told his friend they were so appealing he wanted to touch them"" said a Thai twitter user. ""I was in junior high then. After that I've never worn shorts outside my house. Why do only women have to protect themselves? I'm sick of this.""The act of washing away misfortune has seen Songkran evolve into one of the world's biggest water fights. ""Songkran is traditionally such a beautiful festival,"" said Ms Bishop. ""[But] for a lot of Thai women, it has become dangerous because they know they are going to be taken advantage of"". A 2016 survey conducted by Thailand's Women and Men Progressive Movement Foundation found over half the women in a group of 1,650 had experienced some form of sexual harassment during the festival. Ms Bishop, who said she ""never expected"" her posts to attract so much attention, hopes to keep the conversation going beyond Songkran.""A lot of times you hear people asking women what they were wearing when [sexual harassment occurs], not just during Songkran,"" said Ms Bishop.""Across the globe, you have the feminist movement, the #MeToo movement, conversation on this topic is growing and in the same way, I hope in Thailand this movement continues beyond Songkran."""

560,The RuPaul’s Drag Race spin-off you probably haven’t seen,"Spoiler alert: REVEALS THE WINNER OF DRAG RACE THAILANDThailand has become the first country outside the US to air its own version of RuPaul's Drag Race.In the final episode, three drag queens - Natalia Pliacam, Annee Maywong and Dearis Doll - competed to become ""Thailand's Next Drag Superstar"".The show follows the same format at its US counterpart, but doesn't feature RuPaul as host. Instead, two of Thailand's most famous drag queens - Art Arya and Pangina Heals - present the show. The first international version arrives a decade on from the debut of RuPaul's Drag Race, a show which has gained huge global popularity.It was won by 37-year-old Natalia Pliacam, who lip-synced and danced to Whitney Houston's Queen Of The Night.During her performance, she shot lasers out of her wrists, sending the audience crazy.There were also heavily choreographed performances to Beyonce's Single Ladies, Jennifer Lopez's Let's Get Loud and the Lady Marmalade ensemble.Co-host Pangina Heals feels it was a good representation of what makes Thai drag unique.""It's a good blend of culture,"" he says. ""We mix what it takes to be a Thai person with Western drag.""He thinks Thai people are generally ""less sensitive about what is male or what is female"" and do ""celebrate people for their creative expression"".The final attracted Thai celebrities such as actor Ananda Everingham and model Metinee Kingpayome.Also in the audience was Khun Sumanee Guna-Kasem, one of Thailand's most famous socialites. It was a spectacle, featuring a live audience made up of dozens of young Thai drag queens in elaborate costumes. Despite the temperature reaching upwards of 30 degrees Celsius in Bangkok, it didn't stop members of the audience wearing full faces of make-up and body suits. One surprise came when one of Thailand's most famous popstars - Christina Aguilar (not to be confused with Christina Aguilera) - joined the three finalists on stage while they were lip-syncing to one of her songs. Speaking to Newsbeat, both presenters of Thailand's version hope the programme has educated more people about drag queens. ""Drag is about entertaining. It's telling people that what we do is not about perversion. It's all about performing,"" says Pangina Heals.She thinks some in Thailand still don't realise the difference between drag queens and showgirls - a term commonly used for women or trans women linked to the Thai sex trade.Art Arya, who's also a leading fashion designer, thinks Thai people can still find drag unusual.He says some of the contestants' families have had issues with them as drag queens but their attitudes change when they see them on TV.""They (the families) accept them with warm hearts, generosity and hospitality.""During Thursday's show, finalist Annee Maywong broke down on stage after being shown a video of her father wishing her well in the competition. The ten contestants in Drag Race Thailand competed in fashion, acting and musical challenges, with the bottom two each week battling it out in a lip-sync.In the US, the eliminated queen is famously told by RuPaul to ""sashay away"" but Art Arya wanted to change things up and not copy Ru's famous catchphrases""I put the Thai touch on it. When the contestants leave, I give them a nice message to tell them I love them.

562,Thai beach from Leonardo DiCaprio film to close temporarily,"Authorities in Thailand have ordered the temporary closure of the beach made famous by Leonardo DiCaprio in the movie The Beach.Maya Beach, on the Thai island of Koh Phi Phi Leh, will be closed for four months from June.According to officials, the closure is a bid to halt environmental damage caused by tourists.The closure will allow for the recovery of the island's battered coral reefs and sea life.According to local news outlet the Bangkok Post, all marine parks in Thailand are closed from May to October, during the country's rainy season. The closure also allows for marine wildlife to recover from the effects of mass tourism.However, Maya Bay has previously remained open all year round because of tourist demand. ""Islands have very fragile ecosystems that simply cannot handle so many people, pollution from boats and beachfront hotels,"" Thon Thamrongnawasawat, a marine expert, told news agency Reuters. ""Sometimes, a complete closure is the only way for nature to heal.""Mr Thon added that more than three-quarters of Thailand's coral reefs had been damaged by rising sea temperatures and unchecked tourism. Thailand's National Parks and Wildlife Department will set a daily limit of 2,000 tourists when Maya Beach reopens, and boats will no longer be allowed to anchor there, according to the Associated Press. More than 35 million tourists visited Thailand last year. "
563,Goldie appears in court via FaceTime from Thailand,"Drum and bass star Goldie appeared in court via Facetime from Thailand when a judge refused to delay the hearing.The DJ and actor - real name Clifford Price - was charged with assaulting a security guard at last year's Glastonbury festival.He initially entered a guilty plea by email, but this was not accepted by district judge Lynn Matthews at Bristol Magistrates' Court.When he was contacted via video call, he confirmed his admission.His legal team had applied for the case to be delayed, but this was refused.After the bid was rejected, Price sent an email saying he would plead guilty to assaulting bouncer Dennis Poole on June 23 last year.The court heard Mr Poole was attacked after he refused to let Price's daughter Chance go backstage.The email read: ""Yep, guilty as charged.""Judge Matthews said she was not happy with the unorthodox approach and after nearly two hours of legal argument the court was told Price would plead guilty via a video link.Price, who the court heard was currently based in Thailand, confirmed his name and address to the court after he was was contacted via mobile app FaceTime.When asked his nationality, he said he was ""very British"" and he then confirmed his guilty plea, saying to the judge: ""Correct my dear.""Judge Matthews said she was not Price's ""dear"" and that he must appear in court for sentence - or face a warrant for his arrest being issued.Price, 52, whose address was given as Tring, Hertfordshire, admitted assault by beating.His daughter Chance Price, 20, of Leavesden, was also in court charged with the same offence.The court heard the case against Miss Price would be dropped once her father had been sentenced.Both were ordered to appear before the court on May 30.In many years of covering court cases, nothing has matched the theatrics of today.The legal discussion was intense and, as the day unfolded, you could see the levels of frustration rise in the courtroom.District Judge Matthews summed the mood up when she was told by the defence lawyer that Goldie, aka Clifford Price, would plead guilty. ""I think I want to go outside and cry,"" she said.As she addressed him via a FaceTime call, the judge appeared to become visibly annoyed when he referred to her as ""my dear"".You can almost imagine the one-time James Bond baddie glinting his trademark golden teeth at her all the way from Thailand.Born in Walsall, West Midlands, Goldie made his name as a music producer in the 1990s when the rave scene was at its peak.Known for his distinctive gold ""grill"" - or row of front teeth - he has also appeared on screen, acting in James Bond film The World Is Not Enough, Guy Ritchie's gangster caper Snatch and EastEnders. More recently, he has cropped up in a number of reality TV shows, including Celebrity Big Brother, Strictly Come Dancing, and Come Dine with Me."
564,Thailand rushes to contain rabies outbreak,"Thailand is rushing to contain the spread of rabies after a spike in cases across the country.The virus has been detected in 40 provinces including popular tourist areas Bangkok and Chiang Rai. Three infected people have died this year.Rabies is passed on to humans from infected animals and is almost always fatal. Authorities say the outbreak is ""under control"" and aim to vaccinate 10 million dogs and cats by September. The World Health Organisation say vaccinating dogs is the most effective means of preventing rabies in humans. There have been 400 confirmed cases of rabies in animals in Thailand since the beginning of the year, according to the Department of Livestock Development (DLD).That's double the number over the same period in 2017.Dogs are the main carrier of rabies in Thailand, followed by cows and cats. The DLD has blamed the jump in cases on pet owners not vaccinating their animals, while some local media reports suggest the vaccine has not been made readily available. Failure to immunise pets in Thailand is an offence punishable by a 200 baht ($6.40, £4.60) fine. Authorities have begun vaccinating animals against the disease. The DLD has set a target to immunise 10 million cats and dogs by September this year. The department say ""more than 80% of dogs and cats"" in the country will be vaccinated, adding that there was ""more than enough vaccine"" available.Director-general of the DLD Apai Sutti said Thailand wants to eliminate rabies by 2020. Rabies is almost always fatal in humans and animals. The virus affects the central nervous system, with symptoms including anxiety, headaches and fever.What is rabies? The infection causes tens of thousands of human deaths every year, mainly in Asia and Africa.Humans can be vaccinated against the virus. The rabies vaccine is still effective even if given some time after exposure to the infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say rabies is ""not a major risk"" to most travellers to Thailand. However, the CDC does advise travellers likely to be involved in outdoor activities, or those going to remote regions, to be vaccinated against rabies. Children are also advised to be vaccinated as they are more likely to play with animals and might not report being bitten."

567,'Baby factory' mystery: Thailand's surrogacy saga reaches uneasy end,"The imposing new courthouse for juvenile and family affairs in northern Bangkok was the setting last week for the final ruling in one of the strangest custody cases to emerge from the moral maze of Asia's thriving surrogacy business. At stake was the future for 13 young children, taken into state care as infants in August 2014, after they were discovered being looked after by nannies in a Bangkok apartment.At the time the authorities were investigating fertility clinics in Bangkok believed to be offering commercial surrogacy services - paying Thai women to give birth to babies for mainly foreign clients. This was in response to a Thai surrogate mother complaining that an Australian couple had refused to take one of the twins she had carried for them because he was born with Down's syndrome, a boy she called Gammy. At least nine clinics were raided. One clinic, which was called All-IVF, was shut down. Thailand's crackdown on 'wombs for rent'The 13 children had been conceived under the supervision of Dr Pisit Tantiwattanakul, who ran All-IVF. It turned out that all of them been fathered by then-24 year-old Mitsutoki Shigeta, a Japanese man who had already left Thailand, and who, from Japan, provided DNA samples to prove his paternity of the remaining 13.That a young, secretive and single man would want so many babies raised immediate concern over his motives. The Thai police began investigating Mr Shigeta for possible human trafficking. The surrogacy agent he had first used, the Georgia-based New Life, headed by Mariam Kukunashvili, stopped dealing with him when he told her how many children he planned to father.""Mr Shigeta first contacted us for surrogacy in 2011"", she told the BBC. ""Initially he chose two surrogate mothers, and both became pregnant right away. After that he informed us he wanted more than 1,000 babies, and planned 10-20 surrogacies every year, or more. ""He said he had ten passports, and could register the babies through different embassies. We became very worried about the wellbeing of the babies, and we suspected baby trafficking.""Mr Shigeta's lawyer in Thailand explained that his client simply wanted a large family. As the eldest son of a Japanese tech billionaire, he said, there would be no problem looking after the children properly. But his true reasons for wanting so many children, using surrogates, remain a mystery. The Thai authorities have since identified two children in Cambodia and four in Japan already fathered by Mr Shigeta. Now, after more than three years, the court has awarded him custody of the remaining 13, who have been living in a state children's home. Mr Shigeta has not come back to Thailand to visit them, perhaps fearing either the publicity or possible prosecution, but Thai officials say his mother has visited them every two months.'Baby factory' dad wins paternity rightsThe court ruled that as Mr Shigeta was the biological father of the children, that there was no evidence of ill-intent or trafficking, nor of a criminal record, and that the surrogate mothers had made no claim to them, it could find no reason not to award him custody. It found that he had established bank accounts specifically for them in Singapore, had paid for helpers to assist in looking after them, and was preparing a home for them in Japan, along with schooling.He has also bought a property in Thailand in which to look after the children during a planned transition period, where they will get to know the nannies who will care for them in Japan. Thai officials who visited Japan say they were reassured by the evident affection his four children already living there showed for him. They say they will continue to monitor the 13 who are expected to move to Japan in the near future.The court did not address Mr Shigeta's strange ambition to have hundreds of children, but did say that in considering the interests of the children above everything else, it believed they would be better under the care of a wealthy and apparently conscientious father, than in state care in Thailand.In 2015, Thailand passed a new law strictly limiting surrogacy to Thai couples, and banning commercial surrogacy altogether - offenders face up to 10 years in prison. The business then moved over the border to Cambodia for a while, but in 2016 that country also outlawed the business. Now it has largely moved to Laos, where there is as yet no specific regulation for surrogacy.But the lucrative practice has not died in Thailand. As a regional transport hub, with excellent medical skills and facilities, Thailand is still an ideal location for people to seek surrogacy services, even if the impregnation of surrogates cannot be legally done inside the country. Evidence of cross-border surrogacy appeared last year when a man was detained in April carrying six vials of frozen sperm across the border to Laos. A month later six Thai women were also detained at the border, as the authorities found out they had been contracted to be surrogate mothers in Laos. Websites offering fertility services state that much of the initial process of obtaining eggs from donors and then fertilising them can be done in Bangkok's experienced clinics, before transporting the embryo to Laos to be implanted in the surrogate.Gay couple in Thai custody battle over surrogate babyAt some point Laos too will probably tighten its regulations. But the yearning for children in those who cannot conceive naturally, and the globalisation of the ""wombs-for-rent"" business, makes it inevitable that when that happens it will simply move to another poor country.And 19 children, all close in age, will now find themselves being brought up by a publicity-shy, 28-year-old Japanese man, with the assistance of his mother and an army of paid helpers. By all accounts they will want for nothing, materially, but Mariam Kukunashvili has concerns over the emotional aspects of such an unconventional family.""Ethically, we don't understand how one can share love, time and attention among 300 or 1000 babies. Sometimes wealthy people with no parental experience assume that bringing up children just means hiring dozens of nannies, and paying bills. ""You cannot outsource parenthood entirely to nannies, as this can cause psychological problems in the children and adults."" "
568,Mitsutoki Shigeta: 'Baby factory' dad wins paternity rights,"A Bangkok court has awarded paternity rights to a Japanese man over 13 babies he fathered through Thai surrogate mothers.The ruling allows Mitsutoki Shigeta, 28, to pursue custody of the children.The son of a wealthy entrepreneur, he caused controversy in 2014 when he was revealed to have fathered at least 16 babies via surrogates in Thailand.His so-called ""baby factory"" case and others led to Thailand banning commercial surrogacy for foreigners.Mr Shigeta, who was not present at the trial, was awarded ""sole parent"" rights after the Thai surrogates forfeited their rights, according to the court, which did not name him.""For the happiness and opportunities which the 13 children will receive from their biological father, who does not have a history of bad behaviour, the court rules that all 13 born from surrogacy to be legal children of the plaintiff,"" Bangkok's Central Juvenile Court said in a statement.The corner of Europe where women rent out their wombsThailand's crackdown on 'wombs for rent'Mr Shigeta was awarded custody of his three other children in 2015.In 2014, he was investigated by Interpol for human trafficking after it emerged he had fathered 16 surrogate children in Thailand.His Bangkok apartment was raided and police found nine surrogate babies, nannies and a pregnant surrogate mother there. He left Thailand soon after, but later sued the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security for custody of the children.You may also like:Pyeongchang's 'best and worst' OlympianDrinking cobra blood to survive the jungle Anger at supermodel's new year messageBy Jonathan Head, BBC News, South East Asia correspondentWhen a blurred airport security photo was published, more than three years ago, of Mitsutoki Shigeta, holding an infant as he left Thailand, there was fevered speculation over his motives for siring so many children with surrogate mothers. Some of the children had already been taken to Cambodia, and the Thai police began investigating him for possible human trafficking. But his lawyer insisted he simply wanted a very large family, and that as the son of a wealthy Japanese entrepreneur he was able to look after them properly. A court in Bangkok has now accepted that explanation: Thai officials told the court they had travelled to Cambodia and Japan, and found he had enough carers and facilities to bring up the 13 children who are still in state care in Thailand. Few details are known about the background of Mr Shigeta. According to Japanese media, he is the son of an IT billionaire and paid between $9,300 (£6,600) and $12,500 to each of the surrogate mothers. Thai media says Mr Shigeta is unmarried, owns several companies himself and has already made plans for the future of his children, including setting up trust funds for them. After leaving Thailand four years ago, he was thought to have moved to Hong Kong and currently lives in Japan again. Media reports also suggest he might have travelled to India and Ukraine to father children there.The 13 children will not immediately be transferred into Mr Shigeta's custody. His lawyer told AFP news agency that he would contact the Social Welfare Ministry about next steps, adding that the timelines still had to be agreed to avoid ""abrupt changes"" for the children. Mr Shigeta's case shed light on Thailand's booming surrogacy industry, as did the case of ""Baby Gammy"" which also emerged in 2014.Baby Gammy's Thai surrogate mother alleged that he was abandoned by his Australian parents after they found out he had Down's Syndrome. They took his twin sister home. An Australian court later cleared the family of abandonment."

But a spokesman for the military-backed government played down the association, AFP reports. Mr Prayuth led a military coup in 2014; elections have repeatedly been delayed.His critics say they want new elections, rather than new music. The lyrics to Diamond Heart were written by Mr Prayuth and it is sung by a loyal Thai army officer.The sentimental lyrics talk of promising to overcome obstacles with a woman, who is seemingly supposed to represent the Thai nation.The chorus translates as:""Make your heart a real diamond, unrelenting,Side by side today together, obstacles mean nothing,The lessons we learn are new everyday,We have to build our hearts' dream together so it's resilient"". Thai PM leaves cutout to answer questionsThailand's lese-majeste censorship law explained On social media, many made political plays on the song's title. ""People with true diamond hearts would not lie day after day... and seize power from women,"" one Twitter user wrote, referencing to Thailand's elected leader, Yingluck Shinawatra, who was ousted in the coup. Mr Prayuth had promised elections would be held in November, following numerous delays. However, a new election law passed by parliament in January could see them delayed until 2019. Thailand's military has a history of intervening in politics and has seized power 12 times since the end of the absolute monarchy in 1932.A previous song released by PM Prayuth, called ""Returning Happiness to the People"", was designed to encourage better relations between the military and the people after the last coup.

574,Tammy Duckworth: The mother making history in the US Senate,"Tammy Duckworth is used to being a trailblazer.A double amputee, she was the first disabled woman elected to the US Congress.Born in Bangkok to a Thai mother and American father, she was also among the first Asian-American women in Congress. And now, as confirmed in a gleeful tweet this week, she will be the first woman to have a baby while serving in the US Senate.It was ""about damn time"", the 49-year-old said. ""I can't believe it took until 2018.""On the day Donald Trump defied the odds to defeat Hillary Clinton in November 2016, Tammy Duckworth made her own journey - soundly defeating the Republican incumbent to become the junior senator for Illinois, the position held by Barack Obama when he won the presidency.Her election came four days shy of the anniversary of the event that shaped her later life.""I'm here because of the miracles that occurred 12 years ago this Saturday - above and in a dusty field in Iraq,"" she said in her victory speech.Among the people she thanked were her former military comrades: the men who saved her life after the helicopter she was co-piloting over Iraq was struck by a rocket-propelled grenade.You may find some of the following details distressingDuckworth was a captain with the Illinois National Guard when she was called up to serve in Iraq. It was a war she disagreed with, but she fully accepted the responsibility to go there and fight.She did not have to go to Iraq. She was no longer in charge of her former unit when they were called to serve, but she asked to go with them.""You don't want anyone to face danger and you not face the same danger,"" she told an episode of The Axe Files podcast in December 2016. ""You have to face the same risk.""After a day of routine missions in November 2004, she and her crew were asked to pick up some soldiers from Taji, about 20 miles north of Baghdad.When they got there, the soldiers had already left. The crew decided to return to their base in Balad, about 30 miles further north, and Duckworth handed control of the Black Hawk helicopter to her co-pilot Dan Milberg.During the journey, as they flew low over palm trees to avoid detection, she heard the ""tap, tap, tap"" of gunfire against the helicopter.She leaned forward to get the GPS co-ordinates to report where the helicopter had been shot.""Right then, bam, the fireball happened in my lap with an RPG [rocket-propelled grenade] going off,"" she told The Axe Files.""It took off most of the back of my right arm because I had that forward. It blew off my right leg, it basically evaporated.""My left leg was kicked up into an instrument. The force of that sheared it almost off, it was hanging on a little bit.""Duckworth drifted in and out of consciousness. Every time she became conscious again, she would try to operate the pedals to control the helicopter, but struggled to understand why she couldn't. She did not realise she no longer had feet.Dan Milberg landed the helicopter and carried Duckworth out. Her crew had assumed she was dead, but by nevertheless moving her quickly from the helicopter to get aid, they saved her life.Duckworth woke up about 11 days later, in pain and angry. She had lost both legs and most of the use of her right arm.In later years, she adapted a playful attitude to her amputation - wearing a T-shirt saying ""Dude, where's my leg?"" and addressing the Democratic National Convention with one prosthetic leg painted in camouflage, the other in the American flag.In hospital though, one of her first thoughts was revenge against her attacker. ""I wanted to hunt him down,"" she told The Axe Files.In the end she underwent countless operations and spent 13 months in hospital, much of it at the Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington DC. The hospital, packed with soldiers injured in Iraq and Afghanistan, became what she called ""an amputee petting zoo"" for politicians seeking photo opportunities.It was perhaps inevitable that Duckworth had ended up joining the military, even if she had initially resisted, having hoped to join the diplomatic service instead.Generations of her family had served in the military, going as far back as the American Revolution. Her father Frank fought in World War Two and the Vietnam War.A fierce patriot, Frank Duckworth was a Marine and served as a signal officer in Vietnam. But he found himself confronted and spat at when he returned to the US in between tours as the movement against the Vietnam War gathered strength.He preferred to stay in south-east Asia in between tours, and met Lamai Sompornpairin, who had grown up sewing hats in a Thai factory and was then working in her parents' grocery shop.The couple, with baby Tammy in tow, stayed in the region after the war while Frank worked for the UN Development Programme and different corporations. Tammy spoke nothing but Thai until she was eight years old.Her experiences with conflict began at a young age, as the Marxist Khmer Rouge regime took power in Cambodia.She has said some of her earliest childhood memories are of being in Phnom Penh, watching bombs going off. She said her parents told her to think of them as fireworks, so she would not be scared. Read more: Who were the Khmer Rouge?The latter period of her time in Asia, living in Indonesia and Singapore, gave her pride in being American, and in seeing how people abroad viewed her country.Yet the Duckworths later fell on hard times as Frank Duckworth lost his job. Despite his reluctance to return to a country he felt had rejected him, he had no choice but to go back to the US.At several points, Tammy Duckworth's story echoes that of President Obama, the man who called her ""a tough lady, but with a big heart"" as she ran for his old Senate seat.Both have acknowledged how their mixed-race origins helped form their identities. Both grew up in Indonesia at around the same time, and both left Asia to live in Hawaii.Ladies first: How US politics got left behindWhile Duckworth said the move to a multicultural state like Hawaii was the perfect way for her to assimilate into US life, it was a hard transition for her father.The family depended on food stamps to survive. In 2013, she reflected on her teenage years while speaking in Congress against possible cuts to food stamps. ""They were there for me, so I could worry about school and not about my empty stomach.""Often, Duckworth and her brother Thomas could eat only if their father had found enough coins left in telephone kiosks. When she found work after school, she was the only member of her family to have a job.Her father, who died in 2005, went on to find work at a chicken factory, and Duckworth was able through grants and loans to make her way to three universities.In the end, it was her classmates who convinced her that she could achieve her eventual aim of being an ambassador by joining the military first.""What I didn't expect was to fall in love with the camaraderie and sense of purpose that the military instills in you,"" Duckworth wrote in Politico in 2015.""The thing is, when we were exhausted and miserable, my fellow cadets and I were exhausted and miserable together.""Among the other cadets was her future husband, Bryan Bowlsbey. It wasn't immediately obvious the two were destined for marriage.""He made a comment that I felt was derogatory about the role of women in the Army,"" she told the C-Span news network in 2005, ""but he came over and apologised very nicely and then helped me clean my M16.""It would be far from the last time Duckworth would face a derogatory comment, but it would be the only time she would marry the man who made it.Duckworth's political career took off as her rehabilitation from her injuries was continuing.It was an invitation by Illinois Democrat senator Dick Durbin to attend the 2005 State of the Union address that first ignited her interest.Duckworth had already become an unofficial adviser to younger veterans within Walter Reed hospital, leading Mr Durbin to suggest she should consider running for office.She ran as a candidate for Congress in Illinois in 2006, barely two years after the attack in Iraq.But she lost the race to Republican Peter Roskam by only 5,000 votes. ""I sat in a bathtub and cried for three days,"" she said.Will Trump's election lead to more women in politics?Over the following years, she continued her duties with the National Guard and as director of the Illinois Department of Veterans' Affairs, where she launched a hotline for suicidal veterans and helped improve access to healthcare payments and work for veterans.In 2008, newly elected President Obama appointed her as an assistant secretary to the federal Department of Veterans' Affairs.Then in 2012, she ran for Congress again in another Illinois district - this time against an opponent who openly disparaged her military record.Joe Walsh was hardly the most popular candidate when he ran against Duckworth in Illinois' eighth district.When the Republican incumbent was sued by his ex-wife over missed child support payments, and when he shouted at a constituent, his chances became even slimmer.Then when he attacked the service carried out by Duckworth, by this point a recipient of the Purple Heart medal for those injured in service, his fate was perhaps sealed.""I'm running against a woman who, my God, that's all she talks about,"" he said at a town hall meeting. ""Our true heroes, it's the last thing in the world they talk about.""Duckworth ended up winning 54.7% of the vote, compared with Walsh's 45.3%. She held on the seat two years later. A month later, at the age of 46 and after several unsuccessful courses of IVF treatment, she gave birth to her first child, Abigail.Duckworth often reflects back on the day her helicopter was struck, and acknowledges how her time in the military has helped shape the politician she is today.""That day, and so many others when I served, illustrated the two most important lessons the military taught me,"" she wrote in Politico magazine. ""Never leave anyone behind - not on the battlefield and not in our country. And never put a service member in harm's way without understanding the cost.""But as Duckworth's first race for the Senate was entering its final stretch in October 2016, the Chicago Tribune pointed out that her much-vaunted record on helping veterans had been mixed.After a decade in public service, the newspaper said, ""several"" of her initiatives to help Illinois veterans ""fell flat"", her post in the federal veterans' affairs body ""mostly focused on public relations"" and her two terms in Congress were ""marked by only a few legislative successes"".Duckworth has defended her record, but even one of her headline pieces of policy - a bill she sponsored requiring airports to provide spaces for breastfeeding mothers - has yet to become law.As a senator, her record will now face even more scrutiny. She reached the Senate after another bruising election campaign in 2016, one that saw her opponent Mark Kirk belittle her family's military history.She started her time as a senator optimistically, expressing hope that she and fellow Democrats could work with President Trump.""I am going to start off assuming that he loves this country as much as I love this country,"" she told The Axe Files podcast just before taking office. ""If you start off from that point, I think you can learn to work with anyone.""It has not worked out that way.Instead, Duckworth has positioned herself as one of the most persistent and vocal critics of the president, on issues relating to the military and immigration in particular. Last weekend, as Trump attacked Democrats for not helping pass a funding bill that he said was ""holding our military hostage"", Duckworth attacked him from the Senate floor - noting how he had repeatedly avoided service in Vietnam because of a reported bone spur in his foot.""I will not be lectured about what our military needs by a five-deferment draft dodger,"" she said.""And I have a message for Cadet Bone Spurs: If you cared about our military, you'd stop baiting Kim Jong-un into a war that could put 85,000 American troops and millions of innocent civilians in danger.""Duckworth has been especially critical of Trump over North Korea, warning last month that he and the defence community were gearing up for war.Amid her criticism of the president, the rumblings of a Tammy Duckworth run for the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential race have already started.While she has not acknowledged any interest in running - at least not yet - Duckworth is surely aware that one significant political 'first' has still not been achieved: the first female president."
575,Asian wildlife trafficking 'kingpin' Boonchai Bach arrested,"Thai police have arrested a man alleged to be the head of Asia's biggest illegal wildlife trading networks.Boonchai Bach, a 40-year-old Thai of Vietnamese origin, was detained in a town on the border with Laos.He faces up to four years in jail for smuggling protected animal parts like rhino horns and elephant ivory.Animal trafficking is a lucrative black market trade. Police said the suspect was ""ringleader"" of a ""major smuggling syndicate"" operating over a decade.He was arrested on Friday over the smuggling of 14 rhino horns worth around $1m (£700,000) from Africa to Thailand.After tracking all the people involved in the consignment of rhino horn which was stopped last month, the police say they have enough evidence to charge him. Photo of butchered rhino wins top awardIvory seizures hit record levels last year, report saysLaos is 'world's fastest growing' ivory marketBoonchai Bach was known to run a business from a small border town on the Mekong River, over which illicit goods are often smuggled to Laos, says the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok. Laos is one of the main routes through which poached animal parts from Africa and Asia are moved to buyers in Vietnam and China. However, despite the recent success of the Thai authorities in intercepting shipments of wildlife parts, they have been unable to break up the large and powerful trafficking networks, our correspondent says. The anti-trafficking group Freeland, which helped to find the evidence, believes Boonchai Bach's arrest will seriously disrupt his alleged wildlife smuggling operation, which it says is one of the biggest in this region.The Bachs have ""long run the international supply chain of illicit wildlife from Asia and Africa to major dealers in Laos, Vietnam and China"", Freeland said in statement."

578,Briton arrested after Thai woman dies in balcony fall,"A British national has been arrested in Thailand after the death of a woman who fell from a balcony.Reece Vella, 25, from Worcester, was arrested by Pattaya police on Monday. He is being held on suspicion of causing death by negligence, overstaying his visa, and theft.He is wanted in the UK on an outstanding bench warrant, and in 2012 was jailed for four years and nine months at Worcester Crown Court for rape and assault.Police say Mr Vella was arrested at a bar a short distance from the scene, and had the woman's phone. Midlands Live: Light aircraft deaths investigated; Aga site up for saleThe woman has been identified by Thai media as Wannipa Chanhuaton, 26. She is said to have come from north-east Thailand and worked in a bar in Pattaya. Lt Col Piyapong Ensarn from the force in Pattaya said police checked the property's closed-circuit TV footage and found Mr Vella and the woman entering the room together. He later left the building alone. ""He said he fled because he was scared of the police because he was overstaying,"" Lt Col Piyapong said. ""But fearing of overstaying shouldn't have made him leave the woman like that, so we believed he was involved in her death.""Mr Vella is understood to have been on a tourist visa, but had been in the country for about two months.Officers are now waiting on autopsy results for more information on the circumstances of the death.Pattaya police chief Col Apichai Krobpe said investigators were compiling evidence in the case and it may take up to a month if Mr Vella was to be formally charged in court.Mr Vella previously served for one year and three months with the Royal Logistics Corp and was medically discharged in 2011. On 12 October 2017 he was due to appear at Worcester Crown Court accused of being concerned in the supply of heroin and crack cocaine, but he failed to turn up. An outstanding bench warrant was issued and, according to the Crown Prosecution Service, it is still outstanding.A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said: ""Our staff have offered support to a British man following his arrest in Thailand, and are in contact with the Thai authorities."""

But instead those in the audience were left only with the option of taking pictures with the cutout of Mr Prayuth in a handshake pose. The prime minister did, however, speak to a hand-picked audience of children inside the residence, The Nation newspaper reported. He said it was important to ""engage young people with potential to get in line with 21st-Century democracy"". He also said Thailand ""shouldn't be afraid of politics"" and needed to ""create a new generation of politicians"".Many students who have protested against Thailand's military leadership have been arrested or jailed in the past few years.

581,Thai penis whitening trend raises eyebrows,"A supposed trend of penis whitening has captivated Thailand in recent days and left it asking if the country's beauty industry is taking things too far.Skin whitening is nothing new in many Asian countries, where darker skin is often associated with outdoor labour, therefore, being poorer.But even so, when a clip of a clinic's latest intriguing procedure was posted online, it quickly went viral.  Thailand's health ministry has since issued a warning over the procedure.The BBC Thai service spoke to one patient who had undergone the treatment, who told them: ""I wanted to feel more confident in my swimming briefs"".The 30-year-old said his first session of several was two months ago, and he had since seen a definite change in the shade. The original Facebook post from the clinic offering the treatment, which uses lasers to break down melanin in the skin, was shared more than 19,000 times within two days. It included pictures from the treatment room and detailed before and after illustrations.Comments range from criticism to amusement with some puzzled users asking ""What for?"" and others having suggestions ready at hand: ""It can be used as a torch light. Let it shine!""One user dismissed the sudden frenzy about shades and colour, saying she was ""not that serious about the colour"" but was in fact ""more concerned about the size and the moves"".Controversy over Japan blackface comedyNivea accused of racist cream advertModel in 'racist' Dove ad speaks out Popol Tansakul, marketing manager of Lelux Hospital which offers the service, told the BBC they had introduced vagina whitening services four months ago. ""Patients started to ask about penis whitening, and so we started the treatment a month later,"" he explained. The cost of the laser procedure is $650 (£480) for five sessions.It remains to be seen, though, whether indeed there are enough Thai men wanting to have their private parts a shade whiter. The clinic currently gets an average of 20-30 patients a month coming for vagina and penis whitening with some coming from as far afield as Myanmar, Cambodia and Hong Kong. ""They are popular among gay men and transvestites who take good care of their private parts. They want to look good in all areas,"" Mr Popol explained.Thailand's Public Health Ministry has already reacted to the sudden attention the clinic has been receiving. The ministry warned about possible side effects such as pain, inflammation or scars and even effects on the reproductive system and on having sex. Stopping treatment would cause the skin colour to return to normal and may result in ""nasty-looking spots"", the ministry said. ""Penis laser whitening is not necessary, wastes money and may give more negative effects than positive ones,"" Dr Thongchai Keeratihuttayakorn of the ministry said in the statement.

Overall, Lelux says more than 50% of its patients are coming for such treatments.The trend is largely attributed to the lingering traditional perception that having fair skin means not being part of the working class, and not having to work in the fields. There is an abundance of skin-whitening products on the market and what's caused controversy in the past was usually advertising campaigns to promote these. A skin-whitening cream, for instance, put an ad above the seats on Bangkok's public transport, saying: ""Only white people can sit here."" Another Thai cosmetics firm had to withdraw its video advertising a skin-whitening product after it was attacked on social media for being racist. In the ad, a famous actress attributed her success to her fairer skin. Yet attitudes about skin colour are slowly changing in the past years. During the 2014 Miss Thailand World beauty contest, for instance, much comment centred on how dark the winner's skin was compared to typical contestants.At the time, the model Nonthawan ""Maeya"" Thongleng said she wanted to encourage all other women who felt insecure because of their darker skin.Reporting by Andreas Illmer, Nanchanok Wongsamuth and Thanyarat Doksone"
582,"Thai fraudster sentenced to 13,275 years in prison","A Thai court has sentenced a fraudster to more than 13,000 years in prison.Pudit Kittithradilok, 34, admitted running a Ponzi scheme whereby he promised investors artificially high financial returns.About 40,000 people were persuaded to pour more than $160m (£120m) into his companies.The court found he engaged in illicit lending and some 2,653 counts of fraud. Thanks to his confession, it halved his sentence to 6,637 years and six months.He is unlikely to serve more than 20 years, as Thai law sets a maximum 10-year term for each of the two crimes he was convicted of.China hit by financial scam 'epidemic'Prosecutors told the court that Pudit organised seminars where attendees were encouraged to invest in what he said were businesses linked to property development, beauty, used cars and exports, among other things.According to the Bangkok Post, investors were promised generous returns, plus incentives to bring new members on board.As with any pyramid scheme, these new cash injections would then be used to pay off the earlier backers.  Pudit had been held in Bangkok Remand Prison since his arrest in August, when he was denied bail.The court fined his two companies the equivalent of $20m each. Pudit and the firms were ordered to repay around $17m to the 2,653 identified victims, with 7.5% yearly interest."
583,Sold for ransom: On the trail of Thailand's human traffickers,"As the trade in human beings becomes more and more profitable, the BBC's Jonathan Head discovers that entire communities in Thailand are helping the traffickers.Earlier this month, I accompanied a group of Thai volunteers through the steamy mangrove forest of an island on the Andaman coast. They were following up hazy reports of unmarked graves on the island; it was known to have been used by traffickers to hold large groups of migrants while they waited for transport south towards the Malaysian border.They dug down deep into the waterlogged soil, before the first fragments of bone appeared. Then they pulled at a soggy wet cloth. It was a dress. Inside were the yellowing bones of a woman. Who she was, or how she died, we still do not know. But it is almost certain she was one of the migrants. She must have endured a gruelling sea journey to reach this desolate spot. Had she lived, the ordeal ahead of her, on her route to a better life in Malaysia, might have been even worse.Last October, I was in almost exactly the same area. We had dashed down from Bangkok on news that a group of migrants had been rescued by officials in the district of Takua Pa. In the community hall we found 81 men in acute distress, weeping and praying. Rohingya Muslims have been fleeing here from mistreatment in Myanmar for several years - but this time the men were not Rohingyas. They were Bangladeshis. And some of them told us they had been forced on to the boats that transported them here.District chief Manit Pianthong took us back to where he had found them, in the jungle not far from the site of the woman's grave. They had been starved and beaten over a period of several days. Manit told us his district had long been used by human traffickers to transfer migrants from boats to trucks. He wanted to stamp it out. But he was getting little help from the central government, or from local law enforcement. Over several days, I watched him dealing with angry phone calls from government officials and police, criticising him for talking to the media, and demanding that he send the Bangladeshis to immigration detention centres. It was an open secret that many of the migrants sent there were simply sold back to the traffickers.Manit used volunteers from his own staff to go out searching for the holding camps. He put a 24-hour checkpoint on the main road route south to stop the truckloads of migrants. He put the word out among fishing communities to alert him if they spotted any boats coming in.The arrival of growing numbers of Bangladeshis, together with the Rohingyas, showed that the trade in humans was expanding. And no wonder. It was immensely profitable.Rohingya Muslims mainly live in Myanmar, where they have faced decades of persecution.Rights groups say migrants feel they have ""no choice"" but to leave, paying people smugglers to help them.The UN estimates more than 120,000 Rohingyas have fled in the past three years.Traffickers usually take the migrants by sea to Thailand then overland to Malaysia.But Thailand recently began cracking down on the migrant routes, meaning traffickers are using sea routes instead.Why are so many Rohingya stranded at sea?The perilous journey of a migrant boat that made it The Indonesian villagers saving migrantsThe humidity under the rubber trees was suffocating. A young man in a bright orange shirt moved quickly ahead of me, as I puffed uphill. There was no discernible path. Then he stopped and began talking quickly.Six months earlier he had been living here, he said, with 600 others. He lay down among the fallen leaves and insects to show where they slept, without shelter. They took us to a tent over here, he gestured, and made us phone our parents to demand money. If they could not pay, we were beaten. And over there, he pointed, that is where we saw women being raped. People died, and they sent in trucks to take away the bodies.This was the business model. The Thai trafficking networks bought the migrants by the boatload. The price for a cargo of 300 people, we were told by several sources, including Thai police, was $20,000 (£13,000; €18,000) or more. Then the migrants were held in the jungle until their families paid a ransom, usually $2,000 - $3,000 per person, a huge sum for people usually doing low-end jobs in Malaysia.So how were the traffickers able to conduct this business in the midst of Thai villagers? The camp I saw was just 30 minutes drive from the city of Hat Yai. They involved the local community.Boy, a young Thai Muslim man from a village near the camp, explained how his community was sucked into the trafficking business. A few years back, he said, he had been out hunting birds when he came across migrants, including children, being beaten in the camp. After that he discreetly started offering shelter to migrants who escaped.""The whole community is involved"", he said. ""It's because of the money. The traffickers hire everyone. They hire people to keep watch on the camps, to carry food for the Rohingyas. They go round all the houses here, hiring people."" With the price of rubber, their main crop, plunging, it was a tempting alternative.He told me the young men were also offered drugs as an inducement. So if the migrants escaped - there were no fences - they were likely to be caught, and risk violent punishment by the camp guards.The BBC has seen evidence of the complexity of the smugglers' operation at sites in southern Thailand. In the Takua Pa district, Bangladeshi migrants were rescued by authorities close to the site where the grave of a woman, thought to be a migrant, had been found months later.On 14 May the BBC found a vessel that had been reported stranded at sea in waters off southern Thailand, near the Thai island of Koh Lipe, after local fishermen spotted the boat. It later arrived in Indonesia.Half an hour from the city of Hat Yai the BBC saw another site used as a camp by smugglers - with help from the local community.None of this would have been possible, though, without official connivance. Just how high the involvement went is still unclear. But it must have been very high. Towards the end of last year, I was given a briefing by a senior police officer who knows a lot about the human trafficking trade. He told me of at least one huge camp, right on the border with Malaysia, where 1,000 people could be held.Why did he not shut it down, I asked. He laughed. ""You know the border is a military zone"", he said. ""As a police officer I can do nothing there without military approval."" He had never got that approval. Why did he not go to General Prayuth Chan-ocha, who led last year's coup, and who had pledged to end trafficking? If I try that, he said, the traffickers will be told even before I see him, and they will quickly move the camp. All he could do, he said, was to observe.Six months later, the first mass grave, containing 26 bodies, was found in the same camp that he had been impotently watching.It became difficult to work out who was involved, and who was not. One local police chief told us of his efforts to stop the trade. He offered us the use of his boat to go and look for more. A day later a military unit who had taken us out on patrol with them told us the same police chief was deeply implicated in trafficking. But then their own commitment suddenly looked uncertain when they refused to land us, as promised, in villages we were passing where migrants were believed to have been hidden.One officer showed us several sheets of paper detailing his investigations into prominent business figures in Ranong, a province well-known for its trafficking links. He had names, phone numbers, times of calls, evidence of a well-connected network. This information, he said, had been passed on to the central government. The clear implication was that the government was doing nothing. That officer has now been transferred.""Look, everybody knew those camps were there,"" says Phil Robertson from Human Rights Watch. ""It wasn't just the villagers in the vicinity who were working with the camps and serving as lookouts."" ""These are areas at the Thai-Malaysia border which are militarised. So you had police and military in those areas. There is no way somebody would be able to operate camps of that size without somebody signing off in exchange for a 'packet'"".I stood before a large crowd of Rohingyas, in another local government hall, two days after they had been intercepted. Their guards had been locked up in the police cell next door, and the police chief was questioning them and going through their mobile phones in an effort to find out who their bosses were.I had a question for the Rohingyas. How many of them were worried about whether their families could pay the ransoms the brokers would demand? Almost every one of them raised his hand. ""We don't want to come here"", said Mohammad, a teacher from Rathedaung, in Rakhine State. ""We don't want to leave our motherland. But we don't have anywhere to escape with our lives. The Myanmar government is so bad. They beat us, they shoot us"".But Mohammad had little idea what awaited him in the camps, if he escaped, and ended up back in the hands of the traffickers. Later, many of his group did just that, a military source told us, after they had been transferred to the immigration detention centre in Ranong. Possibly they were sold back to the traffickers, as many had been before them. They were all desperate to reach Malaysia, where there were jobs, families, and hope of a better life.Until their treatment by the Burmese government improves, Rohingyas will continue to flee. But the Bangladeshis have a choice. Only some of them were forced onto the boats. Most were persuaded to board them, by rosy talk of well-paid jobs. Once they understood the brutal reality of the trade, many of them wanted to go home.The Thai ransom business had become so lucrative that the traffickers have extended their operations into Bangladesh, where there is already a well-established network of labour brokers. If the networks are broken, the numbers boarding rickety boats will probably fall sharply.For months we talked to military and police officers who seemed genuine in their wish to stop trafficking. They said they were making progress, but they never seemed to have enough evidence to arrest, or even question, powerful figures in the provinces Ranong, Satun and Songkhla who were believed to be running the business. What seemed to be missing was political will.It was the discovery of the first mass grave that shocked the government into action. The many appalling tales of brutalities we had heard, from people held in the camps, were vindicated by the bones exhumed from the damp, tropical soil. At the time of writing, more than 80 arrest warrants have been issued, and more than 30 people arrested. They include one very prominent businessman from Satun, a few government officials, but so far no military officers. More than 50 police officers have been transferred.Will this anti-trafficking drive be sustained?""We believe there are some much more senior people that were involved in making money off these rackets than have come to light so far,"" says Phil Robertson. ""There is a lot more to be done, a lot more to be uncovered.""Read the terms and conditions."

Something felt really uneasy.""She said the boat was tipped upside down after it was hit by a wave and she managed to get a life jacket and move to an air pocket where she was pulled to safety by rescuers.She said her husband's body was not found for four days.Mr O'Connor described his glasses falling off as the boat capsized. He told how he frantically searched for her as the boat filled with seawater.After he ""swam down and out of the boat"", he reached land where a German woman told him she had seen Mrs O'Connor.""She said Monica's face was white in the water,"" he said.He said he went to hospital hoping his wife was among passengers who swam to another part of the shore but once there was asked to identify her body.The inquest is expected to conclude on Tuesday."
588,100 Women: Rape survivors in Vietnam and Thailand struggle for justice,"Women who survive rape in Vietnam and Thailand struggle to get justice because of claims that sexual violence is only a problem when it happens to ""innocent"" women and girls, a report suggests.A new UN study showed that women were pushed out of the justice system at every stage, from initial reporting through to trial, because of discrimination against them.""Raping a virgin is worse than raping a non-virgin,"" one male Vietnamese police officer told researchers.The study has recommended a number of changes to improve justice outcomes for victims of rape, some of which are already being implemented by authorities.These include training for judges and police to avoid stereotyping and for forensic professionals to ensure evidence is collected in a way that does not cause further victimisation to the woman.Researchers commissioned by UN Women, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reviewed 290 case files from the police or courts and interviewed 213 people including government officials, judicial personnel and civil society activists.It is the first study of its kind to look at attrition; that's the process by which cases drop out or are lost by the criminal justice system.One of the myths exposed by the report was that ""real rape"" involved strangers. Of the cases reviewed, between 86% and 91% of the suspects were known to the victims and the violence took place in a private space.It found that police, prosecutors and judges are not immune to bias and stereotypes, with women often being blamed for the sexual violence they suffered.""You were raped because of the way you dressed yourself, if not by this offender you would be abused by another,"" one statement from a Vietnamese police officer read.BBC 100 Women names 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year.

Find us on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter and use #100WomenDirector General of the Criminal and Administrative Law Department at the Ministry of Justice Vietnam, Ms Nguyen Thị Kim Thoa, told journalists: ""Vietnamese police are mostly male, making female victims feel reluctant to report the case.""Other barriers include inadequate protections offered to victims, encouragement of settlement outside the criminal justice system, a focus on the victim's ""credibility"" rather than forensic or physical evidence and a required time limit for victims to report cases of sexual violence.In Vietnam, marital rape cases were not frequently reported to the police, even though it is recognised as a crime. ""The police and the Women's Union do not believe rape can happen in marriage, so they try to solve these problems through reconciliation,"" one female academic told researchers.In Thailand, victims raised concerns about how they were treated by police officers and said the mandatory forensic examinations did not take into account the time between the incident and when it was reported.Police in Thailand receive no formal mediation and settlement training, but interviews revealed that police too often took on this role.Victims reported that when they were waiting to make their report, the suspect was in the same room and members of the public were able to overhear conversations with the police.Some of the questions female officers asked of victims in police stations in Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Songkhla included: ""It was late why did you go with him in the first place?""What were you wearing when the incident happened?""Why didn't you shout or fight back?""Are you sure that you did not give him any signals that you were interested?""Following recommendations, the Vietnamese government has amended the penal code and criminal procedure code to better support the victims of sexual violence. Victims of sexual assault will now receive free legal aid and there will be a closed hearing room.""There will be more female police officers who are trained to talk to rape victims, as women understand each other better, "" said Ms Nguyen.The Royal Thai Police in partnership with UN Women are expanding the training of officers and will be putting funding toward a public campaign to inform victims on their rights.However, others say there is still a long way to go.Khadad Chouwilai works at the Women and Men Progressive Foundation in Thailand, where he advises victims of rape and sexual violence about their rights.""Gaps in the law make it very difficult for Thai women to take their case to court, especially when financial settlement is suggested,"" he said.Of the 3,000 cases of rape Mr Chouwilai has been aware of this year, only 100 have gone to court.""There are a number of hotlines for women all over Thailand, including in hospitals, but you can't find them everywhere and there are gaps in the service,"" he said.Graphics by Davies Surya"
589,Bangkok photo: US tourists held for baring buttocks at Thai temple,"Two US citizens are being held in Thailand after they posted an online picture of themselves posing with their buttocks exposed at a temple. The tourists had taken the picture at Bangkok's famous Wat Arun temple and posted it on Twitter and Instagram.Immigration authorities told the BBC the pair, Joseph and Travis Dasilva, both 38, would be fined and deported.Thailand has very strict laws on behaviour considered disrespectful and offensive to its Buddhist religion.The two tourists were held late on Tuesday when trying to leave the country at Bangkok's Don Mueang airport.Playboy model angers Maori with nude shoot on sacred mountainDeputy spokesman of the Thai immigration police, Col Choengron Rimpadee, told the BBC the two had been on a watch-list after authorities had spotted the controversial social media post.""Once they are through with the charges, the Thai immigration police will revoke their visas and push for deportation,"" he said. ""They will also be blacklisted from coming back to Thailand.""He explained the two were brought to Bangkok Yai police station to be charged with public nakedness, an offence liable for a fine of up to 5,000 baht ($153; £115).However, other Thai government and police officials have told media that the charges could be more serious.The San Diego Gay and Lesbian News quoted a San Diego city commissioner as saying the men had asked for help.The commissioner, Nicole Murray-Ramirez, told the paper: ""Though I am very disappointed in their actions, I am talking to US government officials to see what assistance we can give them.""People visiting Buddhist sites in Thailand are expected to dress modestly and signs advise them to cover their shoulders and legs. Tourists are also told to not buy statues or images of Buddha as souvenirs.In 2015, four European tourists received jail terms and fines in Malaysia for posing semi-nude on Mount Kinabalu, which is considered sacred. Also in 2015, two American women were arrested, fined and deported for taking nude photographs inside Cambodia's Angkor Wat complex."
590,Dead Thai soldier's missing organs shrouded in mystery,"The case of a Thai army cadet who died under mysterious circumstances and had his organs removed has left his family angry and with many questions.Phakhapong Tanyakan died on 17 October - and his family was told the cause of death was a sudden cardiac arrest. Yet his family became suspicious - because he had previously described brutal treatment at the school.They secretly had a new autopsy done - revealing bruises, broken ribs and many of his vital organs missing. Phakhapong Tanyakan was a first year student at the Armed Forces Academies Preparatory School. When he suddenly died in October the army gave cardiac arrest as the cause of death. But the family did not trust the official version - so when the body was transferred to them for the funeral they brought it for a second autopsy at a private clinic. What the doctors found were severe bruise marks, several broken ribs and broken collarbones - and the brain, heart, stomach and bladder had been removed from the body.""It's beyond words,"" the young cadet's father told BBC Thai. ""This incident for us is similar to a boat capsizing. He drowned to death and left us adrift.""What added to the family's suspicions was that the cadet had previously described experiencing excessive physical punishment. The Bangkok Post cites the cadet's mother saying that he once had to stand on his head as a punishment and had gone into shock and needed CPR to be revived.He had also told his parents that he had been brutally disciplined by senior students in the academy. Rights groups have said that corporal punishment and torture are a common problem in the Thai military. The military responded with a press conference, insisting the death was from heart failure and that the organs had been removed for the first autopsy by the military.An army hospital doctor cited by the Nation newspaper said the organs had been taken out for detailed examination because the body had no signs of injuries.He added they could be returned to the family now the examination had wrapped up. Addressing the allegations of brutal punishment, the military said disciplinary action was under way but that the instances were not linked to Phakhapong's death. Mr Tanyakan's family says it's not yet making allegations or accusations but wants the military to investigate and explain the circumstances of the death. "
591,Uighur inmates dig their way out of Thai jail,"Some 20 ethnic Uighurs from China are on the run after escaping from a Thai detention centre, officials say.The inmates were among a group of more than 200 Uighurs detained in 2014.Officials said 25 inmates dug holes in cell walls and used blankets to climb over the jail's barbed wire near the Malaysia border. Five have been caught.Hundreds of Muslim Uighurs have left their home region of Xinjiang in recent years alleging oppression, which China denies. It calls them illegal migrants. The dramatic overnight escape happened in southern Songkhla province, immigration officials said. The inmates used broken tiles to dig through their cell walls.""Twenty are still at large,"" a senior police official at the detention centre told Reuters. ""Heavy rain helped to mask the loud escape noises.""He said checkpoints had been set up along the border.Many Uighurs flee to South-East Asia seeking to travel on to Turkey. There was an outcry when Thailand returned more than 100 Uighurs to China in July 2015. Earlier that year a court in Thailand had ruled that a group of Uighurs could remain in detention until their nationalities were proven. Both China and Turkey claim them as their citizens.Those who escaped on Monday had no documents and their nationality could not be determined, a Thai immigration official told Khaosod newspaper.China's authorities blame Uighur separatists for instigating violence and the frequent unrest in Xinjiang. They have launched a widespread crackdown in Xinjiang, arresting hundreds and executing dozens in recent years.Activists say that Uighurs have experienced economic, cultural and religious repression by the authorities over the decades, in addition to difficulties obtaining passports. One theory for the deadly 2015 bombing of Bangkok's Erawan shrine is that it was carried out in revenge for the forcible repatriation of the Uighurs in July of that year.Uighurs are ethnically Turkic MuslimsThey make up about 45% of the region's population; 40% are Han ChineseChina re-established control in 1949 after crushing short-lived state of East TurkestanSince then, there has been large-scale immigration of Han ChineseUighurs fear erosion of traditional cultureWho are the Uighurs?"
592,John Mayer surprise for Thai couple's themed wedding,"It was a wedding to remember for two John Mayer fans in Thailand, who paid tribute to their musical idol and received the ultimate surprise - congratulations from the man himself. Bride Saowaluck ""Nong"" Mangtrakul, 36, and her groom Sansern ""Praise"" Saokwan, 35, from Bangkok are massive fans of the US singer-songwriter. And they included him in a whimsical wedding held on the rooftop of a boutique hotel overlooking the Chao Phraya river.""Those who attended our wedding know how important John Mayer is to us. We love him and would have wanted him to join us but we knew that it couldn't happen,"" Ms Nong told BBC News. ""So we thought we should throw a wedding that made us feel he was with us in spirit."" Her husband, a guitarist, said: ""We wanted to portray our admiration for him. We had John Mayer masks. And we used the music we love from all his albums, his pictures as well as his quotes about love from in the reception area."" The couple's hard work and dedication paid off, thanks to a clever hashtag. Before long #TellJohnWeGotMarried was being shared among guests.But it was this personal tweet from BBC producer Thanyarat Doksone, who was a bridesmaid, that caught the singer's attention. More than 1,800 retweets and 23,000 Twitter likes also sealed the deal. ""I couldn't think of a better gift for them than to have John Mayer's blessings,"" Thanyarat said. ""They are his biggest fans and they put together a very neat Mayer-themed wedding. I know my friends thought that it was a long shot to reach to John but I felt it didn't hurt to try. ""Thanks to John for making their dreams come true!""The groom made his entrance, walking in to Mayer's 2006 hit, The Heart of Life. But the night's magical moment came when the bride appeared and walked down the aisle to the singer's cover of the Beyoncé song XO. ""John's songs are always on top of our playlists, for the past 10 years. We never get tired of his music,"" the happy couple said. And for such big music fans, it was a dream come true. ""It's wonderful that John came to know about our wedding,"" Ms Nong said. ""We didn't expect that only one night after the wedding, our dream to have John's blessings would come true. It was way beyond our expectations. We were just so excited.""Other John Mayer fans shared in the excitement, tweeting their congratulations. ""This is the best! Mazel tov to the newlyweds,"" said fellow fan Mimi Hodgkins from Stamford, Connecticut."
593,Andrew Apperley Thailand death: Inquiry branded 'medieval',"An investigation into the death of a British tourist in Thailand has been branded ""medieval"" by a coroner.Sussex coroner Alan Craze made the criticism at the inquest into the death of Andrew Apperley, whose body was found on the island of Koh Phangan.Thai investigating officer Suteep Chadakan had given Mr Apperley's cause of death as asphyxiation by drowning.But Mr Craze said the cause of death was unascertained because of poor information provided to him. Mr Apperley was reported missing after failing to return to his hotel following a Full Moon party in February. His body was found four days later.At the hearing in Eastbourne, Mr Craze also said a toxicology report carried out by the Thai authorities was ""medieval"".Because of the extent the body had decomposed by the time British pathologists could carry out their own examination, they were unable to find a clear cause of death, the court heard.In a statement read out by Mr Craze, police captain Chadakan said a post-mortem examination found no signs of trauma or external wound consistent with a struggle.He said 38-year-old Mr Apperley ""was drinking and taking other substances and became delusional"" during the party, and ""walked into the sea where rocks extended out into deep water and drowned"".However, the family previously told the BBC they were pressing the Thai authorities to investigate further because they suspected foul play.They had found text messages on his phone dating from 13 February, suggesting he felt in danger, they said.Mr Apperley, who was raised in Gloucestershire and had a young daughter, was staying in a hotel on the island of Koh Samui, from there he headed by boat for the party on Koh Phangan.Mr Craze recorded an open conclusion on the cause of his death."

On Monday a court in Bangkok was reported by Reuters news agency to be considering the merits of a lawsuit filed against King Power International.However, the club and King Power say the allegations ""have yet to be accepted"". They said they would ""fight rigorously"" any attempts to ""discredit them"".The lawsuit accuses King Power of failing to pay the Thai government 14 billion baht (£323m) from the operation of a duty-free franchise it was awarded in 2006. The case is also being brought against executives of state-owned Airports of Thailand, Reuters said. A criminal court in Bangkok will now review the evidence next February, the news agency added.But, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, King Power chief executive and Leicester City vice-chairman, said the alleged charges ""have yet to be accepted by the court"". ""[The allegations] are categorically denied,"" he said. ""King Power has always followed and been absolutely committed to the highest standards in proper and ethical business practice. ""We are proud of our company's good name and honest reputation and will fight rigorously any attempts to discredit them"".

Analysis: Professor Peter Leyland - School of African and Oriental Studies This case almost certainly goes back to the time that the airport concessions were given out when the main international airport in Bangkok was being built.  Unravelling the complications of the contract and the concessions is likely to turn out to be a long, drawn out affair, as have been other such cases in Thailand. There have been many cases in recent years that concern Thai billionaires and millionaires, none of whom have ended up in prison.

596,100 Women: Where do women outnumber men in science?," Is Myanmar a paragon of scientific gender equality?Look at the following map, and it can't help but intrigue you. Part of a Unesco report on women in science around the world, countries were coloured in according to what proportion of their researchers were women - the more male-dominated the research community, the darker the shade of blue; the more women, the brighter the pink. Sticking out from the crowd in Asia, Myanmar lit up, the pinkest of them all. According to the tables, 85.5% of researchers in Myanmar were women. Worldwide, the figure is less than 30%.Can the figure really be that high? Probably not - according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization itself. Unesco told BBC News the data on which it had based its report had been gathered in 2002 by Myanmar's Ministry of Science and Technology - and some of Myanmar's universities might have included all of their teaching staff, not just those carrying out research. BBC 100 Women 2017BBC 100 Women 2017: Seven trailblazing women in scienceThe women who sew for NASAWhile the figure might not be as high as 85.5%, it still appears that most researchers in Myanmar are women. A 2013 audit of science staff at the University of Yangon found that 31 of the 45 professors and associate professors were female. Dr Thazin Han, head of food research at the Burmese government's Department of Research and Innovation, describes her work on using shrimp shell waste in the production of fertiliser as her ""most rewarding research"".""The result is very meaningful for our farmers,"" she says. Nine out of every 10 of the professors in her specialism are women, Dr Han says.Like most Burmese scientists, she is a government employee. And that means her work isn't very lucrative.""Due to Myanmar's economy, men need to find money for supporting their family,"" Dr Han says. ""My salary, at executive level, is about $300 [£230] a month."" That's not enough to support a family, she says, so men choose other professions. Other challenges facing Myanmar's government scientists include a lack of resources, and the risk of being transferred to a university without a research department. Dr Han herself was moved to a rural university without a research department - and was there for six years. Last May, she was moved to a post where she could carry out research once more. ""I have a happy life again,"" she says. Let's look at two other countries where most researchers are women. In Thailand, it's 53.3%, while in Tunisia, it's 53.9%. Unesco says that both of those figures are ""realistic"".Prize-winning organic chemist Prof Patchanita Thamyongkit, vice-dean of Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, was mistaken for her own secretary at a conference in 2008 - the organiser had assumed the professor would be a man. She says the Thai royal family has ""led the way"" in encouraging the country's women to go to university. Princess Chulabhorn studied chemistry, graduating in 1979 and going on to promote science in the country.She became the first Asian scientist to be invited to join the UK's Royal Society of Chemistry as an honorary fellow.""In other countries, they say, 'Oh, you have the Chemist princess,'"" Prof Patchanita Thamyongkit says.An academic research job can be attractive to women for other reasons, though. Thailand grants just three months of statutory maternity leave. And a career in academia ""is not bad for being a mum"".""There's a school at the university where children can attend from Kindergarten to the 12th Grade - as soon as a faculty member gets pregnant, they can register their child,"" Prof Patchanita Thamyongkit says.In Tunisia, there are other challenges facing women in science. Prof Oum Kalthoum Ben Hassine is a marine biologist who studies the biodiversity of the Mediterranean. She was born in southern Tunisia - and says conservative attitudes nearly cost her a scientific career. ""At the age of 12, my family wanted to remove me from school to get married,"" she says, describing her route into science as an ""obstacle course"". She says she was the first girl from her city to go to high school, where a science teacher inspired her to pursue the discipline. Prof Ben Hassine told BBC News senior positions, such as laboratory director or professorships, were still dominated by men. In her opinion, ""Tunisian academia remains strongly macho"". And certain fields are more male-dominated than others. In Tunisia, women make up 76% of PhD graduates in life sciences but just 41% in engineering, according to the team led by Professor Sihem Jaziri at the EU's Shemera project.The country also struggles with unemployment - and this isn't evenly split across the genders. According to data from the Tunisian National Institute for Statistics, 19% of male graduates are unemployed - but 41% of female graduates are without a job. According to the Shemera team in Tunisia, even those with PhDs can struggle to find work - and it's harder for women. Read more from Reality CheckFollow us on Twitter"
597,Thailand enshrines ashes of King Bhumibol Adulyadej,"The final stage of the funeral ceremony for Thailand's late King Bhumibol Adulyadej has taken place in Bangkok.The king's ashes were enshrined in two royal temples and Thailand's Grand Palace, where he had lain in state since he died aged 88 last October.On Thursday, hundreds of thousands of people lined the streets to pay their last respects to King Bhumibol, who reigned for more than 70 years.A year-long mourning period ended at midnight (17:00 GMT) on Sunday.It means mourners will now be able to replace their black clothes with more subdued colours, such as brown and blue. Black and white decorations on government offices and homes can also be removed.The elaborate five-day funeral officially started on Wednesday with a merit-making ceremony, a Buddhist rite, in the Grand Palace in Bangkok.On Thursday, the late king was cremated on a royal pyre lit by his son, King Maha Vajiralongkorn, after a procession marked by drums, flute music and an artillery salute.In the final ceremonies, King Vajiralongkorn selected some of his father's ashes to be enshrined in the Grand Palace.Analysis by Jonathan Head, BBC News, BangkokIn his 70 years on the throne King Bhumibol came to be viewed as a divine figure, a reserved, thoughtful man whose quiet leadership was credited with helping Thailand avoid the conflicts that afflicted neighbouring countries. In the last decade of his reign, Thailand became bitterly polarised between two rival political camps, one aligning itself closely with the palace.  A military coup three years ago froze the political conflict and the generals gave themselves the task of supervising a historic and delicate royal transition. This funeral brings that transition to an end, and there is a good deal of anxiety about what will happen when political activity is permitted again, under an untested and very different monarch in King Vajiralongkorn.The late king was seen as a stabilising figure in a country hit by cycles of political turmoil and multiple coups.Profile of King Bhumibol AdulyadejPreparations for this week's events took almost a year and included setting up the large cremation complex near the palace.The funeral site features sculptures of mythical creatures and auspicious animals such as lions and elephants."

599,Thailand begins royal cremation for late King Bhumibol Adulyadej,"The funeral cremation ceremony for Thailand's late King Bhumibol Adulyadej has taken place in Bangkok, with hundreds of thousands of people lining the streets to pay their last respects. A symbolic funeral urn was taken by chariot to the cremation site, in a procession marked by drums, flute music and an artillery salute.Many buildings are draped in yellow marigolds, while crowds of mourners are dressed in black as a mark of respect.The king died in October 2016 aged 88.The five-day funeral officially started on Wednesday with a merit-making ceremony, a Buddhist rite, in the Grand Palace. On Thursday, a series of Buddhist rites began in the royal palace ahead of the procession.The late king was cremated later in a royal pyre lit by his son, King Maha Vajiralongkorn.Images from the elaborate ceremonyThe chariot carrying the urn in the second part of the funeral procession has been used since the late 18th Century. Weighing just under 14 tonnes, it was pulled by more than 200 soldiers.The urn was then carried for several rounds around the cremation site, for the last leg of the procession.The elaborate ceremony is estimated to have drawn as many as 250,000 people from across Thailand. Many of the mourners arrived at the capital days ago, and waited in the streets overnight for the procession, clutching portraits of the late king.Analysis by Jonathan Head, BBC News, BangkokIt feels as though there are two commemorations happening here in Bangkok's old royal quarter. In the inner sanctum, the royal palace and the glittering complex of pavilions built specially for the cremation, the intricately-choreographed procession carrying the royal urn to the cremation site has been conducted by colourfully-uniformed soldiers marching with painstaking formality, presided over by King Bhumibol's son and a host of other family members, palace functionaries and government officials.Outside, thousands of ordinary Thais, dressed in black and wilting in the fierce tropical sun, are saying goodbye to a much-loved monarch in their own way. Many have been unable to get anywhere near the cremation site. So they have camped down by the roads, sharing food, jokes and memories of King Bhumibol. The atmosphere will become more emotional as the moment of cremation draws near, but mostly the mood has been relaxed, informal and quietly respectful.This is a very big national moment for Thais, and they know it. King Bhumibol overshadowed the modern development of their country, and shaped the revered and very powerful monarchy of today. Without him no-one is sure how the country will fare. The late king himself embodied these two sides we are seeing at this cremation. A modern, witty and informal man in person, he nonetheless oversaw the return of a godlike, ritualistic monarchy which has become the anchor for the stable, but ultra-conservative social order which prevails now. Thursday has been declared a public holiday, with many businesses shut all day or closing at midday. Members of royal families and dignitaries from more than 40 countries are attending the ceremonies.King Vajiralongkorn will light the funeral pyre at 22:00 local time (15:00 GMT) and his father's ashes will be collected and transported back to the palace on Friday. Two more days of ceremonies will follow.The late king was seen as a stabilising figure in a country hit by cycles of political turmoil and multiple coups.Since his death on 13 October 2016, Thailand has observed a year of official mourning, with many people wearing black.Profile: King Bhumibol AdulyadejPreparations for this week's events took almost a year and have included setting up the large cremation complex near the palace.The funeral site features sculptures of mythical creatures and auspicious animals such as lions and elephants.According to Buddhist tradition, the funeral rituals are modelled after the universe and the cremation pyre represents a sacred mountain. The funeral ceremonies come with strict guidelines for those attending. Thailand's lese-majeste law, which forbids any insult to the monarchy, is among the harshest in the world.Roads across Bangkok's historic centre are shut for the day and while tourists are not expected to wear black like most Thais, they have been asked to dress and behave respectfully."

605,100 Women: The Muay Thai fighters excluded from the ring for being female,"Traditionally, female Thai boxers must enter the ring by crawling under the lowest rope, whilst men stride over the top rope.Thai boxing, also known as Muay Thai, is Thailand's national sport and it's not for the faint of heart. It involves eight points of body contact and has practices linked to superstition and belief in magic.Beliefs dictate that the head is the highest and most sacred part of the body. Magic blesses the auspicious headband or mongkol that fighters are given. In contrast, menstruation is seen as detrimental to that protective magic, so women - even when they aren't on their period - can't pass over that top rope because they might negate the blessings. However, not all women follow this rule.This belief is taken a step further in two of Thailand's most famous and prestigious boxing stadiums, Rajadamnern and Lumpinee, where there are no female fights.Despite these obstacles, 21-year-old Ratchadaphon Winhantamma, a mother and a professional Muay Thai boxer, says she will, ""continue to fight until her body says no"".Ratchadaphon is known professionally as ""Sawsing Sor Sopit"" in Thailand and won gold at  Turkmenistan's fifth Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games.She says she is determined to push herself further and inspire the next generation of female fighters in Thailand.""Getting married and having a child didn't stop my desire to be a female Muay Thai fighter,"" she says.Early last year Sawsing made the sacrifice of leaving her family for three months to train.""It was very hard time for a mother like me to leave my five-month-old son and practice for competitions when my body had not fully recovered from the delivery,"" she says.She admits she had been under a lot of pressure from her trainer, who questioned why she decided to return to the ring when she had a child and husband to look after.""My thinking is different,"" Sawsing says.""As a mother, I hope to raise my child to the best of my ability. As a female fighter, I hope to raise the bar for other woman, something people don't believe I'm supposed to do.""Sawsing's story is unique. The reality for many female fighters in Thailand is a career in the ring cut short, from family commitments or a lack of sponsorship.Not being able to compete for the top titles at Lumpinee and Rajadamnern is a big drawback. Consequently, female athletes still face difficulties being accepted by commercial sponsors to support their fighting.""Like other sports, male athletes get better paid than women and there are more opportunities. Boxing is no exception,"" says Pariyakorn Ratanasuban, a Thai promoter for female boxers at Onesongchai Boxing Promotion.Pariyakorn is the daughter of the country's leading Muay Thai promoter, Songchai Ratanasuban, and has 30 years of experience in boxing promotion.""Sponsors still play a key role in the boxing industry and opportunities for individual boxers is dependent on sponsors, including how much they earn,"" she says.Most sponsors still believe that boxing is a man's sport, she says, and focus their investment accordingly.Some promoters just don't want to see women fight.Sawsing agrees and says a successful female Muay Thai boxer could make 40,000 baht (£900) for each fight, but a male boxer's earnings start at 70,000 baht (£1,600).She says she's never challenged the traditions that surround women entering the ring.""There is no other way, so we have to follow this rule to pay respect to the teachers and past Muay Thai masters as a part of our culture and tradition. ""These rules have been designed for male fighters, so it is impossible to have us compete in those rings even though it is the ultimate goal for all Muay Thai boxers in the country.""Despite facing these limitations, Pariyakorn believes the sport industry, both in Thailand and internationally, is accepting the increasing role of female Muay Thai boxers and martial arts fighters.This year marked the first time a transgender fighter entered the ring to fight in Bangkok's Lumpinee Boxing Stadium.Pariyakon's company continues to promote female Muay Thai boxing at national and international level, which in turn gives women the opportunity to create a boxing career and inspire the next generation. ""The most important thing is changing the perception of sponsors towards female Muay Thai fighters,"" she says.""In spite of dealing with the challenges in the industry, all female boxers should have the opportunity to become champions.""They should keep training hard, working hard and reach their goals.""Once they become heroes and role models, they will be in demand by sponsors or promoters.

608,Thailand bans smoking on popular tourist beaches,"Thailand is introducing a smoking ban on beaches across the country with those caught violating the law facing up to a year in prison.The measure will apply to up to 20 beaches in areas including the popular tourist destination of Phuket. It comes after the country's Department of Marine and Coastal Resources (DMCR) said it had retrieved tens of thousands of cigarette butts left in the sand.The DMCR said the discarded waste made up a third of all rubbish collected.The head of the department, Jatuporn Buruspat, said that up to 138,000 cigarette butts had been collected by the environmental group over a 2.5km (1.5 miles) stretch of Patong beach in Phuket.Mr Buruspat added that the while smoking will be prohibited on the beaches affected by the measure, there will be ""designated areas"" further inland where smokers will be able drop their litter ""in provided containers"".The penalty for violating the ban is up to a year in prison or a possible fine of up to 100,000 baht ($3,000; £2,280). Thailand's Phuket relaxes sun lounger banThe ban, which will come into effect next month, will apply to beaches in the provinces of Phuket, Prachuap Khiri Khan, Chon Buri and Songkhla, and includes the popular resorts of Koh Samui and Pattaya, the Bangkok Post reports.Thailand is initially implementing the ban on 20 beaches but said that if successful the measure could be uniformly adopted. Mr Buruspat said that officials were also considering measures aimed at tackling the related issue of cigarette butts being dropped by tourists from boats. "
609,Thailand announces 2018 general election,"Thailand's military government has announced the country will hold a general election in November 2018. The military has repeatedly delayed a vote since seizing power in 2014, citing concerns such as changes to the constitution and security issues. Military-appointed Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha told reporters the exact date will be set next June. The announcement comes as the country prepares for the funeral of its late king Bhumibol Adulyadej this month.The government's announcement follows confusion last week when US President Donald Trump, after talks with Gen Prayut, welcomed Thailand's commitment to a return to democratic rule in 2018. The Thai military has seized power 12 times since 1932, but earlier this year pledged not to stage another coup after the next election.In April the country voted in a referendum on a new constitution and a changed electoral system, which observers say is likely to lead to a more splintered parliament. Thai constitution cuts political party powerWhy Thais said yes to new constitution The changes are expected to weaken the country's biggest party, Puea Thai, which has won every election since 2001. Run by business mogul Thaksin Shinawatra until he was ousted in a coup, and then his sister Yingluck until she too was toppled by the military in 2014, the party has proved persistently popular especially with the poorer rural population. Last month, Ms Yingluck was sentenced in absentia to five years in prison for criminal negligence. The country's political landscape has long suffered from the divide between Puea Thai and the military and urban elites. The passing in 2016 of king Bhumibol Adulyadej and subsequent succession of his son Vajiralongkorn has added to the concern over the country's political stability.By Jonathan Head, BBC South East Asia CorrespondentBy November 2018, the symbolically important cremation of King Bhumibol will have taken place, and it is likely that the new king, Maha Vajiralongkorn, will have had his coronation ceremony. Even after the long-awaited election, though, Thailand is likely to have what can best be described as a guided, semi-democracy. A new constitution will continue to give the military significant political power, through its selection of the 250 senators and the creation of a National Strategy Board which will ensure future administrations adhere to the military's 20-year master plan for Thailand. The new electoral system will see the country likely governed by coalitions, in which unelected institutions like the military will be able to exercise influence."
610,Lese-majeste explained: How Thailand forbids insult of its royalty,"Thailand's lese-majeste law, which forbids the insult of the monarchy, is among the strictest in the world. It has been increasingly enforced ever since the Thai military took power in 2014 in a coup, and many people have been punished with harsh jail sentences.Critics say the military-backed government uses the law to clamp down on free speech, and the United Nations has repeatedly called on Thailand to amend it.But the government says the law is necessary to protect the monarchy, which is widely revered in Thailand.Defaming a dog - ways to get arrested for lese-majesteThe case of the single mother jailed for 56 years for lese-majesteArticle 112 of Thailand's criminal code says anyone who ""defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir-apparent or the regent"" will be punished with a jail term between three and 15 years.This law has remained virtually unchanged since the creation of the country's first criminal code in 1908, although the penalty was toughened in 1976. The ruling has also been enshrined in all of Thailand's recent constitutions, which state: ""The King shall be enthroned in a position of revered worship and shall not be violated. No person shall expose the King to any sort of accusation or action.""However, there is no definition of what constitutes an insult to the monarchy, and critics say this gives the authorities leeway to interpret the law in a very broad way.Lese-majeste complaints can be filed by anyone, against anyone, and they must always be formally investigated by the police.Those arrested can be denied bail and some are held for long periods in pre-trial detention, the UN has said.Correspondents say trials are routinely held in closed session, often in military courts where defendants' rights are limited.The jail penalty also applies to each charge of lese-majeste, which means that those charged with multiple offences can face extremely long jail terms.In June 2017, a man was sentenced to 70 years in jail in the heaviest sentence ever handed down, though it was later halved when he confessed. The monarch plays a central in Thai society. King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died in October 2016 after seven decades on the throne, was widely revered and sometimes treated as a god-like figure.He has been succeeded by his son, Maha Vajiralongkorn, who does not enjoy the same level of popularity but is still accorded a sacrosanct status in Thailand.The military, which overthrew the civilian government in May 2014, is staunchly royalist.Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has stressed that the lese-majeste law is needed to protect the royals.One of the justifications for a previous military coup in 2006 was that the prime minister then, Thaksin Shinawatra, was undermining the institution of the monarchy - an allegation he vehemently denies. Though the law has been around for a long while, the number of prosecutions has risen and penalties have grown more severe since the military took power.The UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights says the number of people investigated for lese-majeste has risen to more than double the number investigated in the previous 12 years. Only 4% of those charged in 2016 were acquitted.There has been a wide range of offenders, from a grandfather who sent text messages deemed insulting to the queen, to a Swiss national who drunkenly spray-painted posters of the late king.People have also been arrested for lese-majeste over online activity, such as posting images on Facebook of the late King Bhumibol's favourite dog, and clicking the ""like"" button on Facebook on posts deemed offensive.The social network in fact faced a ban in Thailand in May 2017 for failing to block illegal content including alleged lese-majeste posts, although authorities later backed off.Human rights groups say the government wields the law as a political tool to stifle critical speech, particularly online. The legislation, says Amnesty International, has been used to ""silence peaceful dissent and jail prisoners of conscience"".In February 2017, the UN's special rapporteur on the promotion of opinion and expression, David Kaye, said ""the fact that some forms of expression are considered to be insulting to a public figure is not sufficient to justify restrictions or penalties"".He called for a repeal of the law, saying that ""lese-majeste provisions have no place in a democratic country""."
611,Trump-Thailand talks: What to expect?,"You know those awkward dinner parties when the two people you didn't invite are all anyone can talk about?Well, imagine for a moment the conversation between Thailand's Prime Minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, and the US President Donald Trump. It is likely to be dominated by two countries that have preoccupied President Trump's brain space (and his social media feed) of late: North Korea and China.  But there are other things on the agenda - trade and defence ties for instance are likely to be discussed as well. Here's what I think President Trump will be focused on talking to the Thai leader about:When Prime Minister Prayuth meets President Trump he will get to see first hand what the ""America First"" trade policy really means. President Trump has pulled out of the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal - a deal that Thailand was very close to signing.  This White House administration has been very clear about its feelings with regards to the trade deficit between Thailand and the US - it wants the gap narrowed. The US had a $19bn trade deficit in 2016 with Thailand, but the Thai Commerce Ministry has been keen to point out that is only 1.5% of the US's overall trade deficit, and is based on structural issues and not due to unfair trade policies. Bangkok will be keen to show that it's playing by President Trump's new rules on global trade and not be named a currency manipulator.  But analysts have told me that it's likely the president's rhetoric on trade may  well be a way for him to pressure General Prayuth to take a harder line on North Korea. US officials, like Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, have already pressured Thailand to cut funding to North Korea. Bangkok is home to a North Korean embassy, which many experts believe is a way for Pyongyang to earn foreign revenue. Thailand was also one of the main suppliers of goods to North Korea in 2015. Bilateral trade has dropped substantially since then - by almost 90%, according to Thai officials. But, reportedly, many North Korean businesses still operate out of the country - although not in any significant fashion and certainly not in any way that would flout sanctions. It doesn't do Bangkok any favours to keep trading with North Korea in light of President Trump's aggressive stance on the issue, so it's likely that General Prayuth will be happy to provide the US with the diplomatic support President Trump is looking for - whether he can deliver on clamping down on illicit businesses will be another matter however. What the General won't be able to provide is any assurances to the US that Bangkok won't move closer to Beijing. While the US counts Thailand as its oldest treaty ally in South-East Asia, relations turned colder under the previous Obama administration. The Thai military's coup in 2014 was frowned upon by Washington and as a result, as author Benjamin Zawacki points out in this piece: ""The US suspended military assistance, cancelled a series of visits and downgraded its level of engagement."" The US is also lagging behind China in terms of investments in Thailand. Beijing is courting Bangkok with the One Belt One Road initiative, and they are working on a $5bn rail link connecting China to a number of South East Asian countries - including Thailand. Against this backdrop it's hard to see how President Trump will follow his predecessor's lead in trying to get General Prayuth to account for a realistic timetable for free and fair elections in Thailand, and to restore democracy in the country. Realpolitik wins again. "
612,Yingluck trial: Thai ex-PM sentenced to five years in jail,"Former Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has been found guilty of criminal negligence and sentenced in absentia to five years in prison. The Supreme Court convicted her of mishandling a rice subsidy scheme which allegedly cost Thailand at least $8bn.Ousted in 2014, weeks before a military coup, and later impeached, Ms Yingluck denies all charges and fled before the verdict, reportedly to Dubai.Public opinion is divided. She remains popular with rural and poor voters. The Supreme Court judges said Ms Yingluck had been aware of the falsified rice deals but did nothing to stop it.""The accused knew that the government-to-government rice contract was unlawful but did not prevent it,"" the court said in a statement.""Which is a manner of seeking unlawful gains. Therefore, the action of the accused is considered negligence of duty,"" it said. During her trial, Ms Yingluck had argued she was not responsible for the day-to-day running of the scheme and insisted she was a victim of political persecution.The BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok says ""the verdict sets an awkward precedent, criminalising a prime minister for a policy, which was a central part of her election manifesto"". ""There has been no suggestion that she was herself involved in any corruption,"" he explains. Profile: Yingluck ShinawatraWhat now for Thailand's political future?Part of Ms Yingluck's election campaign, it was launched after she took office in 2011.To alleviate rural poverty, the government paid rural farmers nearly twice the market rate. The scheme hit Thailand's rice exports, leading to an estimated loss the military government says was at least $8bn.Though popular with her rural voter base, the scheme was too expensive and open to corruption, her opponents said.Ms Yingluck is thought to be in Dubai where her brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, lives in self-imposed exile avoiding a 2008 sentence for corruption.Ms Yingluck entered politics only after his sentence and was seen by critics as a proxy for her ousted brother.Both siblings remain popular among Thailand's rural poor, but are opposed by an urban and middle-class elite.She is unlikely to serve any of her sentence because she is out of the country. The trial ran over two years, with a ruling initially scheduled for late August. When Ms Yingluck surprisingly failed to show up in court, the verdict was postponed and an arrest warrant was issued for her.May 2011- Yingluck Shinawatra is elected PM, and shortly afterwards begins rolling out her rice subsidy schemeJanuary 2014 - Thailand's anti-corruption authorities investigate Ms Yingluck in connection to the schemeMay 2014 - She is forced to step down from her post after Thailand's constitutional court finds her guilty of abuse of power in another case. Weeks later the military ousts what remains of her governmentJanuary 2015 - An army-backed legislature impeaches Ms Yingluck for corruption over her role in the rice scheme, which effectively bans her from politics for five years. It also launches legal proceedings against herAugust 2017 - Ms Yingluck fails to appear at court for the verdict, claiming ill health. It is later  thought she left for Dubai"
613,Thailand's political trial of the decade explained,"In an unexpected development, Thailand's former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra secretly left the country in late August just as she was due to appear for a verdict on criminal charges. She has now been sentenced in absentia to five years in jail.The BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok answers some of the key questions around what's going on in the country. The former prime minister was charged with negligence, essentially failing to prevent excessive losses and corruption in a rice subsidy scheme under her administration.She faced up to 10 years in prison if found guilty.Ms Yingluck's government was toppled by the military in 2014, and she was impeached over her role in the rice scheme a  year later.Ms Yingluck was elected prime minister in 2011 and is the sister of former PM Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted by the military in 2006.Like her brother, who remains a dominant influence over the Pheu Thai Party, she introduced populist policies which won her strong support in the mainly rural north and north-east. One of those policies was a scheme to buy farmers' rice crops for a generous price. The military government says it cost the state at least $8bn and was mired in corruption.Our correspondent says it is impossible not to see a political dimension to the trial: ""The military ousted her government in a coup and so the current rulers can hardly be considered impartial. And of course under a military government, there are always suspicions that the judiciary can be influenced.""It is not surprising that Ms Yingluck and her supporters say the whole thing is entirely politically motivated.""Ms Yingluck had been widely expected to turn up in court on 25 August and her sudden disappearance caught her supporters and even some family members by surprise. For months, she had stood firm, refusing to leave the country, even though it is widely believed she was quietly encouraged to do so.But Jonathan Head suggests her flight ""will have been broadly welcomed in top circles, regardless of whether there was actual collusion or not"".""Looking at the way that Ms Yingluck got out of the country so quickly and at the last minute, to flee to Dubai, there's little doubt there must have been some high-level support for this.""The government is denying any collusion but many people on all sides of the political spectrum in Thailand say it is hard to imagine she could have left unnoticed.Ahead of the trial, the military government was faced with a dilemma: whatever the verdict, it would likely have provoked an angry reaction from either of the two sides. Had she been acquitted, hardline opponents of Ms Yingluck would have been upset. Had she been given a prison sentence, her own supporters would have been equally angry.Hence, many people think her fleeing is the best option for the government. ""It takes the sting out of the possible verdict and reduces the possibility of an angry reaction,"" our correspondent explains.""All this comes at a very sensitive time for the country,"" he says. ""The cremation of the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej is scheduled for October, and the government wants there to be complete calm. It is a very important symbolic moment and carries a great deal of significance for the monarchy. The last thing that authorities want is any trouble.""There was a sense of shock when her political followers found out out she had left the country.Her Pheu Thai party has won every election since 2001 but now faces a problem: There is no one else in the family who could take the leadership role that she and before that her brother Thaksin had filled.Yet the huge support base means the party will almost certainly remain the largest political force in the country.There's no other party in a position to replace Pheu Thai, our correspondent says. The party has an emotional hold over the north and north-east, making up about 40% of Thailand's voters. But the damage done to Pheu Thai may reduce its chances significantly of being able to form a government.The new constitution, signed into law by the new king in April this year, already diminishes the power of elected parties. Under the new electoral system, it will be very difficult for Pheu Thai to win an outright majority as it has in the past.So it is likely the previous dominance of Pheu Thai will be replaced by a more fractured political landscape, with the military and the traditional royalist elite playing a more influential role. The fact that Ms Yingluck is out of the country takes away the symbol around which her supporters could rally.""Thailand has been divided and polarised for the best part of the past 12 years,"" Jonathan Head says. ""The military and the conservatives have not been able to destroy the Shinawatra family and the family has not been able to fight its way back into a position of dominance they once had.""The general assumption has been that in the end either one side has to be destroyed, or there has to be a grand bargain. The latter scenario doesn't seem to be viable at the moment, but at the same time it is not clear if the current situation represents the beginning of the final destruction of the Shinawatra family's influence."""

Miss Witheridge had also been raped.Law firm Leigh Day acting for Lin and Phyo, from Myanmar, brought the High Court case, which has been supported by human rights campaigners Reprieve.The NCA admitted five instances of providing assistance to Thai police, relating to phone data and intelligence, which was ""not in accordance"" with official government guidance and therefore unlawful.It also admitted not consulting with the government or agency directors and instead having an ""informal conversation"" with a diplomat in Bangkok about ""generic death penalty risks"".Reprieve said the NCA ""secretly handed over evidence"" that helped secure death sentences in a country known for unfair trials and torture.It added that data which pointed to other suspects was not shared with the pair's defence team.Lin and Phyo, ,who were found guilty in 2015, face execution by lethal injection and have lodged their final appeal. Reprieve said the trial was ""marred by widespread allegations of corruption"".The High Court has ordered the NCA to pay £15,000 to cover the defendants' court costs.An NCA spokesman said the agency had acted in ""good faith"" and conducted a review to ensure official guidance was complied with in the future.""We accept the sharing of some intelligence with the Royal Thai Police in the immediate aftermath of the murders to assist their investigation was not in accordance with HM Government's Overseas Security and Justice Assistance (OSJA) guidance,"" he said."

Redcar was founded in 1917,  producing steel that was used to build iconic structures such as the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Auckland Harbour Bridge.SSI bought the plant from Tata Steel in 2011.Mr Win said that SSI had been hit by a collapse in demand worldwide and in the last quarter alone sales from its upstream business, which included Redcar, fell 15%.He said: ""Global steel over-capacity and demand imbalance since late 2014 and the continuous decline in steel prices resulted in a huge operating loss for the group this year."""

He went there to avoid a 2008 jail sentence for corruption. ""We heard that she went to Cambodia and then Singapore, from where she flew to Dubai. She has arrived safely and is there now,"" a senior member of the Shinawatras' party told Reuters.Deputy national police chief Gen Srivara Rangsibrahmanakul said police had no record of Ms Yingluck leaving the country and were following the matter closely.Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea-ngam said Ms Yingluck's location would ""be clear soon"".Who is Yingluck Shinawatra?Thais seek ex-PM after verdict no-showThailand on edge for trial verdictJudges have postponed the negligence verdict until 27 September.Ms Yingluck, 50, has denied any wrongdoing in the rice subsidy scheme, which cost Thailand billions of dollars.If found guilty at the end of the two-year trial, she could be jailed for up to 10 years and permanently banned from politics.Analysis by Jonathan Head, BBC News, BangkokYingluck Shinawatra was the most high-profile criminal defendant in Thailand and was constantly monitored by the military authorities.

So it is unlikely anyone tried to stop her leaving, or that they will try to get her back.Ms Yingluck's lawyer had requested a delay in the ruling, telling the Supreme Court that she had vertigo and a severe headache and was unable to attend.But the court said in a statement that it did not believe she was sick as there was no medical certificate, and that the alleged sickness was not severe enough to prevent her travelling to court.""Such behaviour convincingly shows that she is a flight risk. As a result, the court has issued an arrest warrant and confiscated the posted bail money,"" the statement said.Ms Yingluck posted $900,000 (£703,000) bail at the beginning of her trial.Friday's turn of events took many by surprise, including the hundreds of people who turned up outside the Supreme Court in Bangkok to support Ms Yingluck.Ms Yingluck, who became Thailand's first female prime minister in 2011, was impeached in 2015 over the rice scheme by a military-backed legislature, which then brought the legal case.The scheme, part of Ms Yingluck's election campaign platform, was launched shortly after she took office.It was aimed at boosting farmers' incomes and alleviating rural poverty, and saw the government paying farmers nearly twice the market rate for their crop.But it hit Thailand's rice exports hard, leading to a loss of at least $8bn and huge stockpiles of rice which the government could not sell.Though it was popular with her rural voter base, opponents said the scheme was too expensive and open to corruption.During her trial, Ms Yingluck had argued she was not responsible for the day-to-day running of the scheme.

She has insisted she is a victim of political persecution.In another development on Friday, former Thai minister Boonsong Teriyapirom was jailed for 42 years in connection with the rice subsidy scheme.The BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok says the exceptionally heavy sentence for Mr Boonsong suggests the court would not have been lenient with Ms Yingluck and it is possible she was warned about this before making her decision to flee.Ms Yingluck's time in office was overshadowed by controversy as well as strong political opposition.The youngest sister of Mr Thaksin, she was seen by her opponents as a proxy for her brother, who was controversially ousted by the military in 2006.Both siblings remain popular among the rural poor, but are hated by an urban and middle-class elite.Their Puea Thai party has - under various different names - won every election in Thailand since 2001.Some of Ms Yingluck's supporters outside the court on Friday expressed understanding at her failure to show.""The Thai prime minister has done her best, she has sacrificed a lot,"" said Seksan Chalitaporn, 64.

621,Thailand on edge for Yingluck trial verdict,"Six years ago Yingluck Shinawatra, a novice who had only been in politics for two months, led the Pheu Thai party, founded and funded by her older brother Thaksin, to a resounding election victory. It was a stunning result for a party which had seen two previous administrations overthrown by a coup and a controversial court decision, and whose supporters had just the year before been involved in an occupation of Bangkok, which ended in bloodshed.An essential part of Ms Yingluck's winning manifesto was a generous promise to rice farmers. That is at the heart of the legal case against her.  Under the new scheme the government was supposed to buy the entire rice crop, and pay 15,000 baht (£350; $450) per tonne, well above the 11,000 baht guaranteed by the previous government. It was wildly popular with farmers. But economists and agricultural experts immediately questioned its viability. The price of 15,000 baht was significantly higher than the global rice price, and Thailand exports more of its crop than any other country - it was the world's number one rice exporter at the time. Its principal rivals India and Vietnam, it was predicted, would simply increase their exports at Thailand's expense, offering a price much lower than the Thai government could, unless it was willing to incur huge losses. And there were many warnings that the scheme was vulnerable to corruption.Six years later Ms Yingluck faces a possible 10-year prison sentence on charges of malfeasance, or dereliction of duty, over the rice scheme. She has not been charged with corruption, but with failing to prevent it, in her capacity as prime minister and as chair of the National Rice Policy Committee. If convicted she could be permanently banned from politics - she has already been banned for five years after being impeached in 2015.Unsurprisingly Ms Yingluck and her party have cried foul. After all her government was overthrown, in 2014, by the same army officers who now run Thailand. They justified their coup by the need to restore order, but had conspicuously failed to offer her support as she faced sustained protests in Bangkok, which had crippled her administration. The military is not seen as impartial, and it wields authoritarian powers, even extending to judicial cases. The rice scheme was inordinately expensive and wasteful. The exact cost, of rice that rotted in storage, that was stolen or improperly sold, is still disputed. But the government estimates it cost the state at least $8bn - some estimates go as high as $20bn, although these include the overall cost of the subsidy, not just losses through corruption and mismanagement. The scheme did raise farmers' living standards, but was almost certainly unsustainable. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence of corruption, although few cases have yet gone to court. The best-known case, in which a former commerce minister and 27 other defendants are accused of an allegedly fraudulent government-to-government deal to sell rice to China, will conclude on the same day Ms Yingluck hears her verdict. Ms Yingluck argued in court that she was not responsible for day-to-day running of the scheme, and that as a key policy platform when she was elected she could not order it to be cancelled. She pointed to what she believes are multiple procedural flaws in the case. Whatever the merits of the case against her, few observers doubt that the military government wants to see Thaksin Shinawatra's political movement weakened before it allows the restoration of some kind of democracy. Ms Yingluck is very popular, and an effective vote-winner. With Mr Thaksin entering his 10th year of exile, his party is struggling to find a replacement leader. But her fate presents Thailand's current rulers with some dilemmas. If she is acquitted Mr Thaksin, who is protective of his younger sister, might be emboldened to push for a greater share of power in a post-election Thailand than the military is willing to accept. An acquittal would outrage hard-line conservatives, and those who led the protests against the Yingluck government. If she is sent to prison, hard-line opponents of the Shinawatra clan would be satisfied, and she would be completely removed from politics. Convicting her would also help the generals to justify their coup, as part of a fight against corruption. But it risks making the telegenic Ms Yingluck into a symbol of resistance for the so-called red-shirt mass movement that supports her.Why is Thailand under military rule?Thailand's lese-majeste laws explainedRed-shirt leaders acknowledge that mobilising large-scale protests against a conviction would be difficult under a military government. They have ruled out any repeat of the occupation of central Bangkok that ended so badly seven years ago. But they say they would view a conviction as the first shot in a re-ignited conflict with the military, as an end to any pretence of reconciliation. And they do not rule out localised demonstrations of anger by Ms Yingluck's supporters. This worries the government, because it wants calm in the run-up to the elaborate cremation of the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej in October. It will also need to be mindful of the wishes of King Vajiralongkorn, who is expected to hold a coronation ceremony not long after the cremation. A possible compromise might be a suspended prison sentence for Ms Yingluck. This is possible if she receives less than five years. Even if she is given a custodial sentence, government legal experts say she can appeal. But that would depend on her. She might choose not to. Behind all of this lies the jostling for a new balance of power once the generals allow an election to take place. In that election, polls suggest Pheu Thai will be the largest party, as it has been in every election since 2001, although the new electoral system will almost certainly ensure it does not win a majority of seats in the lower house of parliament. But the political parties will have to contend with a 250-seat senate entirely appointed by the military, and with a military-drafted reform blueprint for the next 20 years, which all governments are legally required to honour. In this environment no-one is sure who is in line to be the next prime minister.  In the past in Thailand, elected governments were able to concentrate a lot of power and patronage in their hands. That will no longer be the case. Some in Pheu Thai believe it might actually be better for the party to have a spell in opposition - that the first elected government will be so constrained by the courts and the generals it is not a prize worth having. The military itself is factionalised, and it is not clear that the current ruling clique will remain dominant. Another important unknown is what King Vajiralongkorn wants. The intimidating shadow of the lese majeste law makes any discussion of his role impossible in Thailand, but he has already made it clear that he wishes to be consulted on important decisions, and that he is willing to exercise his influence in ways that his father did not.  He may prove to be one of the most important factors in reshaping Thailand's future."
622,Profile: Yingluck Shinawatra,"Yingluck Shinawatra made history when she became Thailand's first female prime minister in 2011 on a wave of popular support.But she was plagued by criticism over her governance and links to her brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.Her time in office ended acrimoniously in early May 2014, when the constitutional court forced her to step down after finding her guilty of abusing her power. The army later overthrew her government in a coup, and formed the present military-backed government of Thailand.Born in 1967, Yingluck Shinawatra first carved out a career in the corporate world before joining politics. She was managing director of AIS, the telecommunications firm her brother founded, and managing director of SC Asset Company, a family firm involved in property.Before the 2011 election, Ms Yingluck, who has two degrees in politics, had never run for office or held a government post. Critics were quick to point out her political inexperience, saying her main qualification appeared to be the fact that she was the youngest sister of Mr Thaksin, the billionaire who was ousted as prime minister by the military in 2006 and jailed in absentia for corruption. They suggested her primary role was to marshal the Thaksin faithful - the mainly poor rural voters who kept him in power - and then serve as his proxy as he governed from overseas exile. Ms Yingluck performed well on the campaign trail - people seemed to warm to her. The numerous supporters of Mr Thaksin backed her party Pheu Thai - which her brother founded - in 2011 polls. Born 21 June 1967Youngest of nine children; elder brother is former PM Thaksin ShinawatraGraduate of Chiang Mai University as well as Kentucky State University, where she earned a master's degree in political science and business administrationMarried to businessman Anusorn Amornchat; has one sonSpeaking to the BBC after her election win, Ms Yingluck said she planned to work hard. People would trust her, she said, as long as the government preserved the rule of law and treated people fairly.  ""As long as we solve problems, I hope Thai people will give me a chance to prove myself and show my sincerity,"" she said then.Three months later, she faced her first challenge as parts of Thailand were hit by severe flooding, and her government was accused of being unprepared.In early 2012, her government approved a compensation fund for victims of recent political unrest, including the families of the deceased, as well as those who were hurt or ""unfairly detained"".Ms Yingluck was also seen to establish cordial ties with two key institutions, the royal palace and the military.  But she also launched a controversial rice subsidy policy, whereby her government bought rice from farmers at above market rates to boost rural incomes. It ended up hitting Thailand's rice exports hard, leading to billion-dollar losses and an accumulation of huge stockpiles of unsold rice.Her opponents said the programme was rife with corruption and many farmers were left out of pocket.It was, however, a political amnesty bill that provided the trigger for protests which foreshadowed Ms Yingluck's demise.Her government proposed legislation allowing amnesty for those convicted of political violence that took place after the coup that ousted her brother, including the mass street protests that paralysed Bangkok in 2010.It proved unpopular with some of her traditional supporters, who argued it would allow those responsible for the deaths of civilian protesters to go free. It also sparked opposition fury, amid fears the ruling party would use it to allow Mr Thaksin back into Thailand without having to serve his jail term. Street protests erupted in Bangkok. Ms Yingluck appealed for calm, and allowed the amnesty bill to fail in the Senate. Her government also called a snap election, which was boycotted by the opposition and later declared unconstitutional.Then the courts stepped in and removed Ms Yingluck - their case was linked to the transfer of her national security chief. Weeks later, the military ousted what was left of her government, leaving Thailand once again under military rule. After leaving office, Ms Yingluck continued to be dogged with controversy, particularly over her rice scheme.In 2015, an army-appointed legislature formally impeached her, resulting in a five-year ban from politics. It also launched a legal case against her.  Ms Yingluck has denied wrongdoing and insists she is a victim of political persecution, as do her numerous supporters.If found guilty in the criminal case, where she has been charged with negligence, she faces up to 10 years in jail and a lifetime ban from politics."

A final appeal has been lodged with the Thai Supreme Court.Nakhon Chompuchat, head of the defence team, said they would argue over the reliability of forensic procedures that confirmed a match in samples collected from Miss Witheridge's body and the defendants.It is not yet known when a decision on the appeal will be made.Miss Witheridge, 23 from Hemsby, Norfolk, and Mr Miller, 24, from Jersey, had been bludgeoned to death. A post-mortem examination revealed Miss Witheridge had also been raped.Thai police claim DNA evidence links both the men to Miss Witheridge's body. Their defence had wanted that evidence re-examined. Lieutenant Colonel Somsak, who led the original police investigation, had told the BBC it no longer existed and a hair sample found in Miss Witheridge's hand was among samples that were lost.Both men deny killing Mr Miller, and the rape and murder of Miss Witheridge, alleging they were framed.They retracted their confessions, saying they had been beaten and threatened into making them.Speaking outside the court following the conviction of the two men, Mr Miller's brother Michael said the result ""represented justice for David and Hannah""."

The court in Khon Kaen later denied at least 10 requests for his release on bail.Watch: Who is Thailand's king?Profile: King VajiralongkornJailed for years for Thai king insultThailand's lese majeste laws explainedThe student, who had initially contested the charges, agreed on Tuesday to plead guilty. He was facing up to 15 years in prison if convicted.Pleading guilty in lese-majeste cases can significantly reduce sentences in Thailand, where punishment can be severe; in June, one man was jailed for 35 years. The United Nations has joined human rights groups in criticising the heavy sentences imposed at lese-majeste trials, which have a conviction rate of more than 90% and are often held behind closed doors.Earlier this year, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights urged Thailand to amend its laws.Since the country's military coup in 2014, more than one hundred people have been charged with defaming the monarchy. King Vajiralongkorn's father, the revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej, died on 13 October at the age of 88 after seven decades on the throne."
626,Thai granny completes university degree at 91,"A 91-year-old woman from Thailand who says it's ""never too late to study"" has completed her bachelor's degree after more than 10 years of work. She spoke to Watchiranont Thongtep of the BBC's Thai service.Kimlan Jinakul had always wanted to go to university but as a young girl simply did not have the opportunity.But almost a lifetime later and after seeing most of her own children through university, she decided to enrol and on Wednesday finally picked up her degree.Kimlan originally comes from the Lampang province in the north of Thailand. She was a smart pupil and went to one of the best schools in her province. But moving on to university was not an option at the time, and after her family moved to Bangkok she got married and had to abandon her dream to study further. ""I have always, though, wanted my children to be able to study. So I encouraged and supported them when they wanted to to go to university.""Four of her five children got a masters degree and one even went on to receive a PhD in the US. And it was her kids' academic experience that eventually led her to get enrolled herself.When one of her daughters - who was already working at a hospital - took a course at Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University, Kimlan decided to get on board as well. She was 72 when she first enrolled, but tragically, the daughter she was studying with died. Kimlan dropped out of the course for a few years. When she was 85, she went back for a second shot and enrolled for a degree in Human Ecology - a programme that she said would teach her how to live a good and happy life. ""After recovering from the loss and sadness, I pushed myself to finish this programme. I'm hoping my daughter's soul would be pleased to see this,"" she told the BBC.Singapore's guitar-playing hard rock grannyIndian great-grandmother becomes YouTube starKung fu grandma is China's new internet sensationJapan's 'golden coder' making games apps aged 82During her years of studying, her daily routine was to rise early and give alms to Buddhist monks, then visit a temple in the neighbourhood and eventually sit down and study. ""It's never too late. My mind is always awake and sharp for learning,"" Kimlan said.""This world never stops. There are always new problems for us to solve. If there were no new sciences, the world would stop prospering,"" she said. Asked about the secret to success, she said it was determination and ambition that got her that far. ""When I told myself to finish one chapter, I would try my best to do so. I underlined all the key points I needed to memorise. And that's what helped me during my study reviews.   ""I was glad when I passed and sad when I failed. So I re-took the exam until I passed,"" she laughed. So what's the plan now that she's got her degree? ""I don't think anybody would employ me if I were to look for a job,"" she jokes. ""I will just continue to look after my grandchildren."""

628,Thailand monks: Wirapol Sukphol case highlights country's Buddhism crisis,"It was a jarring image; a group of Buddhist monks, with shaven heads and orange robes, sitting back in the soft-leather seats of an executive jet, passing luxury accessories among themselves. The video of the monk, now known by his pre-monk name, Wirapol Sukphol, went viral after being posted on YouTube in 2013.A subsequent investigation by the Thai Department of Special Investigations (DSI) uncovered a lifestyle of what appeared to be mind-blowing decadence. They tracked down at least 200 million Thai baht ($6m; £4.6m) in ten bank accounts, and the purchase of 22 Mercedes Benz cars. Wirapol had built a mansion in southern California, owned a large and gaudily-decorated house in his home town of Ubon Ratchathani, and had also constructed a giant replica of the famous Emerald Buddha statue in Bangkok's royal palace, which he claimed - falsely, as it turned out - contained nine tonnes of gold.There was evidence, too, the DSI said, of sexual relationships with a number of women. One woman claimed he had fathered a child with her when she was only 15 years old, a claim the DSI says is supported by DNA analysis. Wirapol fled to the US. It took four years for the Thai authorities to secure his extradition. He has denied criminal charges of fraud, money laundering and rape.How had a monk acquired so much influence, even in his early twenties? How was he allowed to behave in ways which clearly violate the patimokkha (the 227 precepts by which monks are supposed to live)? Monks are not even supposed to touch money, and sex is strictly off-limits.Monks behaving badly are nothing new in Thailand. The temptations of modern life have thrown up many examples of monks with unseemly wealth, monks taking drugs, dancing, enjoying sexual relations with men and women or abusing girls and boys.There are also temples which have attracted large and dedicated followings, through skilful promotion of charismatic monks and abbots, said to have supernatural powers. These have capitalised on two aspects of modern Thai life; the yearning for spiritual succour among urban Thais, who no longer have a close relationship with a traditional village temple, and a belief that donating generously to powerful temples will bring success and more material wealth.It appears Wirapol tapped into this trend. He arrived in the poor North Eastern province of Sisaket in the early 2000s, establishing a monastery on donated land in the village of Ban Yang. But according to the sub-district head, Ittipol Nontha, few local people went to his temple, because they were too poor to offer the kind of donations he expected. The monk started holding elaborate ceremonies, he said, selling amulets, and built his replica of the Emerald Buddha, to attract wealthier devotees from other parts of the country. These followers have described being beguiled by his soft, warm voice, and convinced by his claim to have powers - like the ability to walk on water and talk to deities. In turn, Wirapol gave generously to those with influence in the province; many of the cars he bought were gifts for important monks and officials. Even today he still has supporters, who argue he is at heart a good man, entitled to enjoy donated luxuries.After a succession of scandals, people are openly talking about a crisis of Buddhism in Thailand. Numbers of ordained monks have been falling steeply in recent years, and many smaller village temples are unable to support themselves financially.The body which is supposed to govern the Buddhist clergy is the Supreme Sangha Council, but this comprises a group of very elderly monks, and until this year had not had a properly functioning Supreme Patriarch for more than a decade. It has proved ineffective. The National Office of Buddhism is also supposed to regulate the religion, but it too has been plagued by leadership turmoil and allegations of financial irregularities. Curious case of a hidden abbot and a besieged templeIn pictures: Thai monks clash with policeThe government has now introduced a law requiring temples, which collectively accumulate $3-4bn (£2-3bn) in donations every year, to publicise their financial records. It is also talking about introducing a new, digital ID card for monks to ensure those tainted by malpractice cannot be ordained again.The faltering morality of monks, though, is partly rooted in the way Buddhism has evolved in Thailand. For 150 years there have been two quite different forms of Buddhism; that of the more austere, Thammayut tradition, practised in the elite, palace-backed temples of Bangkok, which upholds the strict rules about monks detaching themselves from the material world; and the looser Mahanikai tradition of the provinces, where monks are part of the community, joining neighbourhood activities, sometimes in violation of the patimokkhai. In the villages, temples have served as schools or traditional centres of medicine and venues for local celebrations. The advice of monks has been sought on a range of worldly issues; in this environment the line between what is and is not acceptable behaviour can become blurred.The other source of the problem is the hold that superstition has over many Thais, and the way this has become commercialised. Monks are these days often used more as deliverers of semi-religious rituals - like blessing new cars or houses for good luck - than practitioners of the 227 precepts. No-one in Thailand bats an eyelid at the sight of lottery tickets being sold inside temples. This love of superstition extends to rich Thais, who are happy to donate generously in the belief this will ensure greater fortune in the future.Phra Payom Kalayano, the abbot of a temple north of Bangkok well known for his criticism of the commercialisation of Buddhism, has appealed to Thais to be more thoughtful about donating.""Nowadays people think good karma is about throwing money at temples - especially rich people. They have faith, but they don't think. That is not practising good karma, smartly. That is just blind faith. ""At the same time, some monks are stupid. They don't know how to manage the donations they receive. Instead of managing the money to build karma and prestige for the temple, the monks end up building criminal cases against themselves,"" he said.In a simpler age, before the arrival of globalisation and its many consumer distractions, it was easier to advocate a monastic life that disavows all material pleasures. But it is harder today to insist that monks should forego technological conveniences like smartphones and air travel. It is even harder to define what role monks should play in 21st Century Thailand, beyond the provision of services like amulets and good luck blessings, which can so easily turn into a money-making business.Thailand country profile"
629,Extradited Thai ex-monk charged with child sex offences and fraud,"A former monk has been charged with sex offences, fraud and money laundering after being extradited from the US to Thailand. Wirapol Sukphol, formerly Nen Kham, became notorious in 2013 when a YouTube video appeared to show him on a private jet with a designer bag and sunglasses.Later in 2013 he was accused of having sex with an under-aged girl and fled to the US soon afterwards. Mr Sukphol is expected strongly to contest all the charges against him.He is reported to have resisted the move to extradite him from California.The former monk faces charges of child molestation and child abduction. He is also charged with money laundering and fraud after investigators say millions of dollars of assets were discovered in his name. He arrived on Wednesday in Bangkok wearing clerical garments despite being expelled from the monkhood, the Bangkok Post reported.Buddhism is traditionally one of the three cornerstones of Thai society along with the nation and the monarchy. Temples are at the centre of community life, especially in rural areas.But the monkhood has come under increased criticism in recent years following a succession of scandals, mostly involving sex and money. The military - which has been running Thailand since a coup in 2014 - is under increasing pressure to tackle some of the alleged excesses.One of the most high-profile cases has involved influential Buddhist abbot Phra Dhammajayo. He is wanted on money laundering charges but police were prevented from arresting him earlier this year by thousands of the abbot's supporters who say the charges are politically motivated."
630,Thailand general jailed for human trafficking at mass trial,"A former Thai general has been sentenced to 27 years in jail for human trafficking at a landmark trial.Manas Kongpan is among more than 60 people convicted in Bangkok of trafficking Bangladeshis and Rohingya Muslims, a minority fleeing Myanmar.Another top former official was sentenced to 75 years in prison. More than 100 defendants were on trial.Muslim Rohingya have been fleeing Myanmar for years, paying people smugglers to help them escape.The arrest of the general in June 2015 was seen as part of an effort by Thailand to close down a human smuggling route through the country.The judge found him guilty of human trafficking and organised transnational crime. A former head of administration in the southern province of Satun, Ko-Tong (also known as Patjuban Aungkachotephan), received a sentence of 75 years in prison.Several other defendants were handed jail terms of similar length. Sentences ranged from four to 94 years.In 2009, Manas told the BBC that Thailand treated migrants humanely after he was accused of ordering more than 1,000 Rohingyas to be set adrift at sea on boats with no engines.Correspondents say he is the first member of the military in army-ruled Thailand to be implicated in the trafficking of migrants.Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, head of the country's ruling junta, urged the public not to blame trafficking on military figures.""There are many people in this human trafficking network,"" he told reporters. ""Don't group all soldiers in the country as one.""In 2015, thousands of refugees were left stranded at sea as they tried to escape through southern Thailand and on to Malaysia and other destinations. The crisis escalated after international pressure forced the Thai authorities to crack down on the smuggling networks. This led to the smugglers abandoning the refugees, leaving them on their sea and land routes with no neighbouring country willing to take them in. The current trial was sparked by the discovery of mass graves of refugees in jungle camps near the Thai-Malaysian border.Most of those indicted are from Thailand but several citizens of Myanmar (also called Burma) and Bangladesh are also being held.A senior policeman who led an investigation into human trafficking in Thailand, Major General Paween Pongsirin, fled to Australia fearing his life was in danger from influential figures implicated in trafficking in his country. Who will help Myanmar's Rohingya?UN to probe Rohingya abuse in MyanmarOn the trail of Thailand's human traffickersThe Rohingya - a distinct Muslim ethnic group who are effectively stateless - have been fleeing Myanmar for decades with Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia the most desired destinations. While they say they are descendants of Arab traders who have been in the region for generations, Myanmar's government insists they are not a genuine ethnic group but rather Bengali migrants. Among the refugees stranded during the 2015 crisis were also many economic migrants from neighbouring Bangladesh."

632,Actor Paul Nicholls rescued from Thailand waterfall,"British actor Paul Nicholls has been rescued after being trapped at the bottom of a waterfall in Thailand for three days, his agent has said.The ex-EastEnders star had motorcycled to the site in Koh Samui before falling, breaking both legs and shattering a knee. He was unable to use his phone after it broke, but local villagers alerted police to his abandoned motorbike. The 38-year-old Bolton-born actor's agent said he was ""recovering well"". Nicholls will be flown back to the UK next week.The actor, who played Joe Wicks on the BBC soap in the 1990s, was on holiday in Thailand after finishing filming for the Channel 4 series Ackley Bridge. After being alerted, police searched records to find out who had rented the bike and found it had been rented to a British tourist called Paul Greenhalgh - Nicholls' real name.Volunteer rescuers, police, and medics went to search for the actor, and found him several hours after setting off. Nicholls' first TV appearance was aged 10 in Granada Television show Children's Ward. His EastEnders character Joe Wicks lived with schizophrenia, and the popular soap was praised for its portrayal of mental health on-screen. Since EastEnders, Nicholls has appeared in a number of TV shows, including Law and Order UK, Casualty, and Grantchester. His most recent TV appearance is in Channel 4's Ackley Bridge, where he plays a teacher in a school where British Asian and white British communities merge. "

634,Gunmen in Thailand kill eight in village chief's home,"Thai police say eight people died after gunmen opened fire inside a village chief's home, in a rare mass shooting.The incident took place on Monday in the southern province of Krabi, which is popular with tourists.Police said the gunmen, who wore military-style clothing, had demanded to search the house. The attackers held those in the home, including the chief, captive for several hours before shooting them and fleeing in a car.Three people were also seriously injured in the attack, which police believe stemmed from a personal dispute.An official told the Khao Sot news website that the chief had ""many disputes"" in the area.The gunmen reportedly gained entry to the house by posing as officials who wanted to check on illegal activity.Krabi province draws crowds every year who visit its beaches and cliffs. But AFP news agency said the incident did not take place in the province's main tourist areas.Many in Thailand own guns, and the country has a high gun-related homicide rate, but mass organised shootings are considered rare."

636,How did my cheap shoes lead to peace?,"In the grand scheme of things, they are pretty ugly shoes: brown, fake leather, with three buckle straps and a sole and heel the pollution in Bangkok and three months of constant wear would turn from a tan colour to a steadfast black.I'd been selected as one of 24 mid-career professionals from around the world to take up a Rotary International peace fellowship. It involved three months studying peace and conflict at Chulalongkorn University, in Thailand.My classmates would be peacekeepers who had seen war and conflict up close. They were professors and activists from places such as Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ireland, Zimbabwe and Nepal. The hope was we'd graduate brimming with solutions to help a world that, let's face it, needs people minded to try to find peace where they can.But I'd only been in Bangkok two days when I realised I had a problem. As I looked down after seven hours of exploring the streets, I saw my feet, swollen in the heat, were bleeding - cut to pieces by my seven-year-old weathered sandals. With temperatures set to rise, and school starting early the next morning, I had to buy new footwear. They had to be respectable, so my trainers wouldn't cut it. We had been warned before we came out that Thailand was still in the midst of a year-long mourning period for the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej. My outfits, therefore, had to be suitable from head to toe, especially since I was attending the royal university.I left my room in a rush and spotted a chap in my dorm corridor. ""Are you new? Are you a Rotary fellow too? Want to help me buy shoes?"" Andrew Miles, a policeman from Melbourne, knew when he had been ambushed. Fifteen minutes later, we found ourselves in the midst of the MBK shopping centre.Ten minutes after that and 500 baht (£11) poorer, I had in my hand two pairs of sandals that could easily be slipped off at temples and people's homes, as the Thai culture required, and could also cope with swelling feet in Bangkok's rising heat.Global educationIs a peace scholarship worth pursuing?How can you train to be a top tennis umpire?Historic violin lent by Oxford University to Syrian refugeeUN warns 'no progress' in lack of school placesRubbish collector builds library from discarded booksEducation aid 'stagnates' despite pledgesGet in touch with the Global education series.The sandals certainly got a battering. As a vegetarian, Bangkok's street food proved a bit of challenge. Lesson one: to find peace, learn as much of the language of the country you've moved to as quickly as you can - especially when it comes to meal time. This will prevent ""hanger"" (when you get angry because you are so hungry). Lesson two: be ready to walk, and walk and walk as you try to find somewhere that can cater for your strict dietary requirements. Be careful of getting overexcited by meal spots, as you may end up tripping over your toes.  I can testify that falling flat on your bottom on Bangkok's incredibly busy streets is not a good look.At first, things went well. School was a 10-minute walk away, and guest lecturers included Buddhist monks, military generals and academics with years of experience in peace studies.Topics included storytelling and peace and conflict analysis tools. Friendships and bonds emerged through this unique programme. Where else would a London journalist like me end up sharing washing powder with Natasha Dimitrovska - a feminist from Macedonia - or have daily morning coffee with Manty Hasan- a peace activist living in Aceh, Indonesia?I was following in the footsteps of more than 400 peace fellows who had studied peace and conflict at the Thailand centre.But those shoes were not what I thought I'd bargained for. The rubber soles on one pair gave away in the heat and when you live a student life, you revert to cheap fixes. One message I sent to the group's WhatsApp chat included: ""I accidently superglued my sandal to the floor; anyone got any nail polish remover I could borrow?""One day, Travis Burke, an American classmate who had worked in war zones, sewed together my other pair of broken sandals with a travel kit he had had the foresight to bring with him. Lesson three: a needle and thread is a life-essential for any emerging cracks.Designer Christian Louboutin has called shoes a ""communication tool between people"", and that leads to lesson four.Resolving conflict is about finding things in common. Even things that might seem insignificant. Like shoes.We were on a field trip to Sri Lanka to look at the after-effects of the civil war, which had almost destroyed the country. As we drove down in the coach from Jaffna, in the north, to Sri Lanka's capital, Colombo, the pounding those fake leather shoes had taken meant that the buckle snapped again. This time, the attempts by Travis and Kenyan farmer Emmanuel Karisa Baya to fix them with the adhesive tape led to something quite unexpected. Travis started playing his ukulele, and Kemuel Laeta, a Solomon Islander with a water-bottle tambourine, and two Kenyans, Karisa and Dan Noel Odaba began a jamming session.The combination of this motley crew who tried to fix my shoes led to not just an idea for a global business venture but an accompanying jingle - Mzungu Repair. The word 'Mzungu' means 'white person' in Swahili and the original repair shop would be founded by Travis and Karisa with franchises elsewhere.This petri dish of voices from different cultures blended together.The tape was a temporary fix - my shoes were a write-off.But the song brought people from 19 different countries together, not quite in vocal harmony but, certainly, in peace.Follow Dhruti Shah on Twitter: @dhrutishah"

638,Thai police called in to take on village's female ghost,"Officers of the Royal Thai Police Force have been called on to undertake a ghost-busting mission in eastern Thailand, where a malevolent female ghost has reportedly left villagers spooked for months.Police were dispatched to a village in Amnat Charoen province to deal with the ghost, known locally as ""phi pob"", which villagers said had killed four cows and caused four border police officers to fall ill, Thai online media outlet Khaosod English reports.Village leaders had requested a police presence to ""strengthen civilian morale, prevent panic and boost residents' confidence in living their daily lives"", the website said.Police have already started their patrols to ward off the spirit, with local police chief Adul Chaiprasithikul stating that, at present, ""more people believe in phi pob than those who don't"".The so-called phi pob is believed to have the ability to possess humans and wreak havoc on an entire village, with many rural communities reporting hauntings each year, the report says. In 2016, three individuals reportedly possessed by a phi pob forced family members and neighbours to strip naked at knifepoint.The spirit is the subject of a long-running Thai film franchise known as Baan Phi Pob.But it doesn't appear to be the only ghost on the scene in Thailand, a country known for its superstitions.According to online Thai newspaper Samui Times, at least 20 other spirits inhabit the country, but not all are malign.The Phi Poang Khang spirit, for instance, is known to take the ""shape of a black monkey that likes to hang out near salt licks in the jungle and suck the big toes of people sleeping there.""At the other end of the spectrum is the Phi Kra-sue spirit, described as the most feared ghost in the country.The spirit is said to takes the form of a beautiful woman who mesmerises her prey and is ""often seen in long flowing dresses to hide the fact that she has no lower body, just a mass of internal organs and intestines suspended from her head"".Next story: Algerians champion traditional dress for Eid al-Fitr Use #NewsfromElsewhere to stay up-to-date with our reports via Twitter."
639,Nitcharee Peneakchanasak: Amputee wins 'best job in Thailand',"A Thai woman who lost both her legs as a teenager has won a job in a hospital which will pay her one million baht (£23,000; $29,000) a month. Nitcharee Peneakchanasak was announced on a TV talk show as winner of the competition named Best Job in Thailand.She was chosen for the six-month ""happiness observer"" post from hundreds of applicants, the hospital says.Supporters across Thailand had been rooting for the 21-year-old who lost her legs in a 2011 rail accident.The World Medical Hospital in Bangkok which offered the job is only four years old and has attracted widespread attention with its unique job offer.According to a hospital spokesman, Nitcharee or ""Thun"" was selected from more than 800 applicants who submitted video applications for the job.""I think I won the competition because I was true to myself. I showed them that this is what I love doing. Plus, I had overcome the [accident], which was quite a unique experience,"" Nitcharee told the BBC's Thanyarat Doksone.""I was very surprised because I thought I was quite young and inexperienced, compared to other candidates. But I'm very glad because I love talking to people and I want to talk to the patients. I dreamed of being a psychologist.""Nitcharee is currently studying journalism at Thammasat University in Bangkok.Part of her duties will be to observe patients and talk to them to help the hospital administration find out more about their needs. She will also be asked to write inspiring stories on Facebook.""We believe that doctors can only treat physical conditions of patients but we rarely know what's on their mind,"" the spokesman told the BBC. ""If we know what they want and help them, they will recover more quickly from their illnesses.""Thun has experienced a tragic event that had a huge impact on her but her mind is so strong. She went on to speak to others and became their inspiration to fight. We're proud to have her,"" he explained. In 2011, the then teenage girl lost both her legs when she fell off an MRT platform in Singapore in front of an oncoming train.Her story gained huge attention both in Singapore and Thailand at the time.

640,Thailand King Vajiralongkorn shot at with air pistol,"The authorities in Germany say the King of Thailand was unhurt when two teenage boys shot at him in the dark with an air pistol.King Maha Vajiralongkorn - who spends much of his time in Germany - was cycling late at night with his entourage near Munich airport.The boys - aged 13 and 14 - shot at him from the window of a house in the town of Erding on 10 June, prosecutors say.It's not clear if they hit the king but no-one was injured.King Vajiralongkorn, 64, took the throne last year following the death of his father.""As of now it is not certain that the king himself was hit,"" a spokesman for the local prosecutor's office, Thomas Rauscher, told BBC Thai. ""All that is known is that the king was part of a group of cyclists and that shots were fired at this group.""He said shots were also fired later when the group drove past in the king's car. ""The total number of shots is as yet unknown. We know however that more than one shot was fired.""Profile: Thailand's new King VajiralongkornPrince Vajiralongkorn leads bike ride 'for Mom'Thailand's lese-majeste laws explainedIt's not clear if the boys knew who they were shooting at.The 14-year-old is being investigated on suspicion of attempted bodily harm, although the king declined to press charges. The 13-year-old is too young to face prosecution under German laws.""The king was not interested in taking any legal action against the boys… But in Germany, it is not up to the victim to decide [about the charges],"" said Mr Rauscher.The monarch's personal guards are understood to have called the police.The king has two villas on Lake Starnberg, about 60km (37.5 miles) away from Erding, Bild Zeitung reports.He will not be formally crowned until some time after the cremation of his father, which is expected later this year.Late King Bhumibol Adulyadej was widely seen as a pillar of stability during seven decades of political turmoil in Thailand.But his son is yet to enjoy the same level of popularity, and has spent much of his life abroad.Married and divorced three times, he has seven children. Most ordinary Thais know only a few details about who he is and how he lives his life.But many will remember his interest in cycling. In 2015 thousands of Thai cyclists joined the then-crown prince in a ride through Bangkok in honour of his mother, Queen Sirikit.It was the first event to be publicly led by the prince and served to underline that he was the undisputed heir to the throne."

642,Jailed for years for Thai king insult,"The United Nations has called on Thailand to amend the harsh law against insulting the monarchy. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said it was deeply troubled by the high rate of prosecutions, and the disproportionate sentences for the offence. It says that since the military coup in 2014 the number of people investigated for violating the lese-majeste law has risen to more than double the number investigated in the previous 12 years. The BBC spoke to the mother of Sasiwimon, who was jailed for 28 years after being found guilty of posting anti-monarchy content on Facebook. She was reported to the police by another Facebook user."
643,Thailand lese-majeste: UN urges amendment to law,"The United Nations has called on Thailand to amend its harsh law against insulting the monarchy. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said it was deeply troubled by the high rate of prosecutions, and the disproportionate sentences for the offence. The UN said that since the military coup in 2014 the number of people investigated for violating the lese-majeste laws has risen to more than double the number investigated in the previous 12 years, and that only 4% of those charged were acquitted.Trials are routinely held in closed session, often in military courts where defendants' rights are limited. Earlier this month a man was given a 35-year sentence for Facebook posts judged to have defamed the monarchy, the harshest penalty to date.Two years ago, a similarly harsh sentence was given to a woman in the northern city of Chiang Mai.On 7 August 2015, two military courts in Thailand handed down what were then the harshest sentences ever imposed under lese-majeste.In the first, a court in Bangkok sentenced a 48-year-old tour guide operator, Pongsak Sriboonpheng, to 60 years in prison, 10 years for each of the Facebook posts critical of the monarchy that he was charged with writing. Because he pleaded guilty the sentence was halved to 30 years.Pongsak acknowledged that he had become politicised during the prolonged political conflict which preceded the 2014 coup, and had often posted his views on Facebook.But the second case, in Chiang Mai, was baffling. A 29-year-old single mother, with no history of political involvement, was sentenced by a military court to 56 years in jail, also for posting anti-monarchy content on Facebook. Her sentence, too, was halved after she agreed to plead guilty.She had begged for leniency, given the ages of her two young daughters, and her mother's poor health. The tribunal was unmoved. Her name is Sasiwimon, and her story illustrates the sweeping scope of the lese majeste laws, deployed by a military government which has made defending the monarchy's exalted status in Thailand its highest priority.The regime at the Chiang Mai Women's Prison is relaxed enough to allow frequent family visits. But Sasiwimon's mother, Suchin, can rarely break away from her job as a cleaner in a hotel, and the two girls are in school most days. At best they can go every week or two. It takes up to two hours to get inside the prison, through the paperwork and security searches. Sasiwimon was brought out to meet us, in her loose blue prison dress, holding her arms out to the girls. For the hour we were allowed to stay, she did not let go of them.She had been married to a mechanic, she explained, but he had left her for another woman. A friend she had made during a previous job in a restaurant had suggested to Sasiwimon a way to get back at the woman, by using a fake Facebook account. Thailand's lese-majeste laws explainedDefaming a dog: The ways to get arrested for lese-majesteThailand investigates BBC over king profileShe says the friend came back to her home, and used her computer to set up the account. Sasiwimon only found out what kind of comments the she was leaving on the fake Facebook page when she was sent screenshots of them a few days later. That friend has since disappeared, she says.At around the same time Krit Yeammaethakorn, who leads a group of ultra-royalists in Chiang Mai that monitors social media for anti-monarchy content, spotted the offending Facebook page.""I was angry,"" he recalls. ""This was not about politics. It was a natural reaction. We discussed what we had seen among ourselves, and decided that we had to act.""Mr Krit has strong feelings about the monarchy. He sobbed openly when he remembered hearing of the death of King Bhumibol last year. ""I know we are the only country in the world that still treats kings like gods, like demigods. Yet our late king was not just a god - he was a living deity.""That's how Thais feel toward him. I believe that in 5,000 years of world history, there has been no other king who was as great as he was.""On 27 September 2014, Mr Krit's group informed the Chiang Mai police, whose investigations eventually traced the Facebook page to Sasiwimon's computer.Sasiwimon remembers the police coming to the house early in the morning a few days later. They confiscated her computer and two mobile phones. She accompanied them to the station, with her youngest daughter, who was running a high temperature. The police showed her some of the comments from the Facebook page, and asked her to sign a document acknowledging that she had seen them. She says she did not understand that she was in fact signing a confession. She and her mother say they knew nothing about the lese majeste laws. Sasiwimon says she had an alibi for the times the posts were published on Facebook; that she had been at work, in the hotel where her mother is also employed, and that she had no internet access there.Four months later, Sasiwimon was asked to come back to the police station. She has been in custody ever since.""I thought she was going to show up and then leave,"" Suchin told me. ""I had no idea it was going to be this severe. I thought it might be a one-year sentence, maybe suspended. We never sold drugs. We never killed anyone, or stole anything.""We learned about this law when it was too late. I didn't even have time to come to terms with the fact that my child would be gone.""Typically for a lese majeste case, she was refused bail. When her trial date finally arrived after five months, on 7 August 2015, her lawyer advised her that she had little chance of acquittal, and should change her plea to guilty to reduce the sentence.The charges were read out in a closed session, because the alleged offences were deemed too sensitive for the public to hear. And because she pleaded guilty the evidence against her was never tested.""When the verdict was read, my ears were ringing,"" recalls Suchin. ""They said this offence insulted the high institution, so it carried a high penalty. I didn't know how high. I thought ultimately it might be four to five years, but I never thought for a second it would go that high. More than 20 years… I didn't even think about 10 years.""In a military court, under martial law, there was no right of appeal.In their small rented house in Chiang Mai, the tatty calendar on the wall has been left with the front page at August 2015, the 7th ringed, and also the 28th. I asked Suchin why. She said that while her eldest granddaughter had understood the sentence, the youngest, who was then seven years old, had thought it meant her mother would be coming out on 28th August.There are also faded pictures of the royal family on the walls. ""No-one in this family has ever insulted or defamed the monarchy. Never,"" she said.When he informed the police about the Facebook posts, Mr Krit had not known who was responsible for them. Would he do the same again, knowing that a young mother of two girls would get such a long sentence?""I don't regret it and no-one else does. This is an issue affecting the highest institution, for which Thais have the utmost respect,"" he told me. ""It's like when a judge hands down a sentence but he still manages to remain unattached emotionally.""Although the culprit was young, she didn't understand the law, and has two young children, the right thing is… even if we had not filed a complaint, the law had to deal with her. The offender had to be punished.""Mr Krit has not inquired about Sasiwimon's situation now, but hopes she will get a pardon. And perhaps there is some official acknowledgement that the sentence against her was too harsh, as she has already had her sentence reduced, in two royal pardons, to 12 years. This still means her daughters will have grown up by the time she leaves prison.But she remains hopeful of further pardons, although embarrassed, she says, that she has to ask for mercy from the very institution she is accused of insulting."
644,Luke Miller Thai pool death: 'No evidence' of murder,"There is ""no evidence"" a British backpacker who was found dead in a swimming pool in Thailand was murdered, a coroner has concluded.Luke Miller, 26, of the Isle of Wight, died on Koh Tao island in January 2016. Coroner Caroline Sumeray said: ""It has been suggested this was a cover-up by the Thai authorities but there has been a very thorough police report.""British backpackers Hannah Witheridge and David Miller were murdered on the same island in 2014.Mr Miller, a bricklayer from Newport, travelled to Thailand with his friend James Gissing on 22 December 2015. His body was found at the bottom of the pool at the Sunset Bar at Sairee Beach on 8 January 2016. Mr Gissing and his sister Nicola Gissing - who joined the friends in Thailand from Australia - were initially told by local police he was seen to be assaulted at another bar the night before he was found dead, and they were treating the case as murder, the inquest at Newport heard. However, Ms Sumeray said the police contact could not be relied upon as there was no confirmation a man they spoke to was a Thai police officer.She said the man later told the friends via WhatsApp messages that police no longer believed Mr Miller had been ""fighting"" or was murdered. In a statement read to the court, Mr Gissing said he felt ""police were covering up as it was the death of another foreigner on Koh Tao"".The hearing was told a witness described a man banging heads with another swimmer but Ms Sumeray said there was no evidence this was Mr Miller.The court also heard Mr Miller lost the key to his rented motorcycle in the Sunset Bar pool a few days before his death, and despite searches to find it had paid the 5,000 baht (£114) fee for its replacement.A post-mortem examination in Thailand showed Mr Miller had a number of small bruises on his face and legs and concluded he died as a result of head injuries and drowning, the inquest was told.Toxicology tests showed he was one-and-three-quarters above the UK alcohol drink-drive level and also had traces of the drug Ritalin in his system.Ms Sumeray said: ""I can only record a conclusion based on the evidence before me, I cannot speculate about what may have happened.""At the conclusion, Mr Miller's mother Sara Cotton wept and said: ""I want my son.""

645,The drug addictions devastating Thai villages,"Across Thailand's southern provinces, communities have been struggling with rising drug use in recent years despite crackdowns and education efforts. BBC Thai's Nanchanok Wongsamuth reports on the villages devastated by addiction.In a small wooden hut in the middle of a rubber plantation in Narathiwat province, 28-year-old Fadel and his friends often take a drug known as kratom. Also known as ""4X100"" in Thai, kratom contains four main ingredients - the leaves of a local plant known as kratom, cough syrup, Coca-Cola and ice. It is sold for around 100 Thai baht (£2.30, $2.90) per kit.""In the past we used to boil [the leaves] ourselves, but now we buy them ready-to-drink,"" Fadel told BBC Thai at the hut, where Coca-Cola cans are seen scattered on the floor.Fadel has been taking drugs regularly for the past 11 years. He also uses crystal methamphetamine, and ya ba, a stimulant containing a mixture of methamphetamine and caffeine that sells for around 100 baht per pill.He now takes one ya ba pill every two days, and drinks kratom three times a week when he is tired from work as a rubber planter. He sometimes resorts to stealing dried betel nuts to sell and fund his addiction.Fadel is one of the estimated 80,000 to 100,000 drug users in Thailand's predominantly Muslim southernmost provinces, about 5% of the population. Most of these users are aged between 14 and 30 years old.The three provinces of Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat have the highest rates of drug addiction, according to the Thai military. An estimated one in five teenagers are addicts. Kratom is by far the most popular drug.A recent survey found that more than 80% of people living in those provinces feel that drugs is their most pressing issue, and want the government to solve it.Villagers have told BBC Thai that stealing is prevalent, as drug users are desperate to find a way to obtain money.""Most people here are farmers, and things get stolen when they go to bed and no one's minding the fields,"" said Samart Lakatap, a probation officer in Narathiwat province.""The problem is that the buyers are in it too - they know the sellers are drug addicts.""The addictions have had a deep impact on communities and relationships.Infidelity used to be the leading cause of divorce among Muslims in Thailand's southern province of Pattani. That has recently changed as a growing number of women face neglect as a result of their husbands using drugs.""Nowadays, when a man makes a marriage proposal, the first question the father will ask her daughter is if [her boyfriend] takes any drugs,"" said Ahama Hayeedermee, secretary of Pattani's Islamic Council. Last year, the council received 525 filings for divorce, of which 80% were on the grounds of drug use. The council says it tries to mediate, but most of the complaints end in divorce, since most men do not attend the sessions.In one village in Narathiwat's Marue Botok sub-district, a local man called Ismail told BBC Thai that his stepson Zabar got married last year. Four months later Zabar's wife divorced him, after her mother found out Zabar was a drug addict.Mr Ismail said Zabar started sniffing paint thinner at the age of nine, before getting addicted to marijuana and then ya ba. He quit school after second grade and was sent to a juvenile detention centre for two years at the age of 16.Mr Hayeedermee said kratom addiction started becoming a problem in 2012, and he estimates that almost 90% of all villages in Pattani have drug users, mostly teenagers. ""We don't know why, but the number [of addicts] is on the rise,"" Mr Hayeedermee said. ""I used to ask the soldiers why there are so many drugs in Pattani and how they can escape the checkpoints. They didn't have an answer.""The Thai military government has claimed that security issues in the insurgency-torn south have prevented them from solving drug-related issues in the region. That led to a ""secret"" report submitted by the national security council to the cabinet in 2009, which included claims that insurgency groups used drugs to influence youth to join their groups, and also used money from the drug trade to sponsor their violent activities. ""Many times when we arrest drug kingpins, we also find war weapons,"" Col Suwan Chirdshai of the Internal Security Operations Command (ISOC) Region 4, which oversees military missions in the south. ""Many times we also receive information that those involved in the drug trade have wired money to local insurgency groups…and those arrested by security forces have said they were paid for by drugs.""But that information contrasts with that from the non-governmental organisation Aids Access Foundation. A 2007-2011 field survey of staff found that none had been in contact with any drug users associated with insurgency groups. ""The government discourse is that those spreading drugs are insurgency groups… but they [local people] think that it's the government who is bringing in the drugs,"" said Phrae Sirisakdamkoeng, an assistant professor in anthropology at Silpakorn University. ""The only question they have is: how can there be drugs when there are so many checkpoints?"" Col Suwan said although there are many checkpoints in the southern provinces, vehicles are randomly checked or inspected only when there is a tip-off. ""There needs to be a tip-off in order [for a vehicle] to be thoroughly inspected, and therefore [the drugs] are from the vehicles that were not inspected,"" he said. The Thai military is trying other ways to tackle the problem, such as education.At an ISOC drug prevention training centre in Pattani's Yarang district, about 145 villagers, village headmen, former drug users and traders are singing and reciting oaths.""Do whatever you can for children to hate drugs,"" the centre's director, Col Suwan, told the crowd.The group is participating in the Yalannanbaru project, which means ""the new path"" in Malay.Yalannanbaru initially started in 2007 as a project to educate youth with risks of developing a drug addiction. In 2015 its volunteers started to reach out to those in need in each village, without the use of law enforcement.  There are currently 2,512 volunteers in 352 villages, with the number next year expected to reach 20,750 volunteers in 2,075 villages. ""A crackdown accomplishes very little, it is impossible for them [drug users] to quit because they are already addicted. Apart from that, the government is not able to gain access to drug users,"" said Col Suwan.Ladda Ningoh from non-governmental organisation Ozone Foundation said the government is also trying to solve drug issues by creating jobs, but this has run into problems too.""Getting them a new job in order to say that this project had this many successful participants is not a very straightforward thing to do, because sometimes you have rubber planters who have to learn how to become a barber just to meet the government's goals,"" she said.She added that follow-up attempts by village chiefs also cause conflict within communities.Some villages have taken matters into their own hands.Using drugs is considered a great sin in Islam, and some places have issued rules for the village known as ""hukum pakat"", such as religious leaders not participating in activities with drug users.In the village of Ban Uyib, scrap metal, electricity wires, boilers and even betel nuts, coconuts, bananas and scrap rubber are stolen on a daily basis.This has led to the village setting up rules where both drug buyers and sellers will be fined and reported to the police. The rules, which came into effect in March, were printed on a vinyl board and placed at the mosque.Rosalee Hajiteh, the village chief, claims that thefts have since stopped.But other places are still struggling.""I used to tell the village chief that our people are not happy with all the thieves around here, but he didn't do anything,"" said Ismail in the village in Marue Botok.""Even in our village we don't talk about it, and the government doesn't help.""The names of villagers in this story have been changed to protect their identities."
646,Asian nations make plastic oceans promise,"Nations responsible for much of the world's ocean plastic pollution have promised to start cleaning up their act.At a UN oceans summit, delegates from China, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines said they would work to keep plastics out of the seas.Some of the promises are not yet formalised and environmentalists say the measures proposed are not nearly urgent enough.But UN officials praised the statement. Meeting in New York, they said it was part of a clear international shift against ocean pollution.Eric Solheim, the UN's environment director, told BBC News: ""There are quite encouraging signs, with nations taking the ocean much more seriously. Of course, there is a very long way to go because the problems are huge."" 'Worst' products for recycling namedSeabirds 'blighted by plastic waste'Plastic heading for oceans quantifiedIt is estimated that 5-13 million tonnes of plastics flow into the world's oceans annually. Much of it is ingested by birds and fish – and fragments of plastic have even been found in organisms at the bottom of the ocean.A recent paper said much of the marine plastic often originates far from the sea – especially in countries which have developed consumer economies faster than their ability to manage waste.The  Helmholtz Centre in Leipzig, Germany, estimated that 75% of land-borne marine pollution comes from just 10 rivers, predominantly in Asia.Reducing the plastic loads in these rivers by 50% would reduce global plastic inputs by 37%, it said.Tom Dillon from the Pew Charitable Trusts, which campaign on oceans, urged China to move quickly.He told BBC News: ""For thousands of years the Maritime Silk Road was a pathway for export of Chinese culture and influence. Will the ocean be a vehicle for export of Chinese pollution, or a new culture of conservation and sustainability?""A report to the UN conference from the Thailand government says most marine plastic debris is land-based, caused by inefficient waste management and poor handling of plastic wastes.In Thailand, the total amount of garbage finding its way into the sea was estimated at 2.83 million tonnes in 2016 - of which 12% was plastic.The Thai government says the nation has established a 20-year strategy to tackle the problem, including developing financial incentives for keeping plastic out of the sea and encouraging eco-packaging design and eco-friendly substitutes for plastics.In Indonesia, the government is starting a mass education programme for schoolchildren, and in the Philippines new laws are being developed.Part of the challenge is finding substitutes for plastics. An international prize for smarter materials and design for packaging was launched recently by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"
647,Human Rights activist to sue Thai authorities,"A UK human rights campaigner is suing authorities in Thailand following his conviction for criminal defamation.Andy Hall, from Lincolnshire, was given a three-year suspended jail term and fined £3,300 in September 2016.He had contributed to a report by a Finnish group that accused a Thai fruit company of abusing migrant workers. Hall is taking legal action against Thai state prosecutors and police claiming unlawful prosecution and harassment.The Royal Thai Embassy in London has been contacted by the BBC for comment.More on this and other Lincolnshire storiesHall had provided research to a report by Finnwatch in 2013 alleging the Natural Fruit Company mistreated its workers. The report included claims migrant workers were being paid wages below the legal minimum, working long hours at factories and had had their passports illegally confiscated.Natural Fruit, one of the country's biggest pineapple producers, denied all the allegations and brought charges against Hall, who was living in Thailand at the time.Hall, who left Thailand after his conviction, is also taking action against the Natural Fruit Company for initiating the prosecution.""I am launching these litigations consisting of two sets of criminal  prosecutions today with a heavy heart and not out of anger or with any desire for revenge,"" he said.""It is regretful that things have reached this stage.""

648,Thai military hospital bomb blast injures more than 20,"More than 20 people have been injured in a small bomb blast at a military hospital in the Thai capital, Bangkok. The explosion happened at Phramongkutklao Hospital, which is used by serving and retired members of the military and their families. It took place on the third anniversary of the 2014 coup which brought the military government to power.Police said it was not clear who was behind the blast, which happened in a waiting room by a pharmacy.  ""We found pieces of a circuit and a battery, as well as some wires. We'll investigate further but initially we found the explosive had a range of 2-3 metres,"" the Bangkok Post quoted Deputy National Police Chief General Srivara Rangsibrahmanakul as saying. Officials said most people had minor wounds from flying glass. ""Eight people were admitted to hospital to observe their condition... among them is one woman who needed surgery because of shrapnel buried in her jaw,"" AFP quoted hospital director Saroj Keokajee as saying. Thai newspaper The Nation said Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha had ordered an immediate investigation into the attack at the hospital, which also treats civilians. Three years after the armed forces seized power in Thailand, they rule almost unchallenged; the few who have dared oppose the government openly have been detained and charged. But there have been occasional small bombs, presumed to be in protest against the military. One went off last week close to the royal palace, where preparations are still under way for the elaborate cremation of the late King Bhumibol, who died last October. The military has succeeded in maintaining order and stability through a sensitive royal succession; but it has done little to address the political divisions underlying the conflicts which preceded the coup.Three years ago to the day the military ousted an elected government following months of street protests. Since then, Thailand's military leaders have clamped down on critics, political opponents and free speech. An election is due by the end of next year. It will be held under a new military-drafted constitution that critics claim only allows for a partial, guided democracy.Thailand has faced a power struggle since Thaksin Shinawatra was ousted by the military as prime minister in 2006.He and his sister (who led the government ousted in 2014) have strong support in rural areas, but they are hated by a military-backed urban elite who accuse them of corruption."
649,Danny Glass charged over Thailand scooter death,"The boyfriend of a pregnant woman killed in a scooter accident in Thailand is to be charged over her death, police in the country have said.The scooter Danny Glass was riding on with Sophie Emma Rose Anderson collided with a truck in Phuket on 8 May.Mr Glass, 29, originally from Margate, escaped serious injury. Now he and the lorry driver Natt Awut Timsue are to be charged with causing death by reckless driving, Thai police said.Mr Glass - who lived in Thailand with Ms Anderson - is to hear the charges formally on Thursday and a translator has been called in for the hearing.His family is expected to attend.Ms Anderson, 41, originally from Blackpool, was a keen video blogger, as was Mr Glass.She had a YouTube channel called Sophie's Joy Breastfeeding Mama, on which she uploaded videos about nursing her son until the age of eight.After her death Mr Glass paid tribute to her in a video he uploaded on YouTube.He said he ""missed her so much"" and added: ""Somebody wake me up from this nightmare... she is meant to be having my baby in three months.""On Tuesday he posted another video titled 'When will I come back to Youtube', in which he stated he would not be posting any more videos for ""a while"" and did not know when he would return online.He said: ""It's not the right time at the moment, I need to get my life in order and get through this death.""A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We are in contact with the Thai police and are providing consular support to a British man following a road traffic accident in Phuket."""
650,Two Britons arrested in Thailand over football streaming,"Two British men have been arrested in Bangkok for allegedly selling online access to illegally streamed football broadcasts.The Premier League said it supported local authorities in investigations that led to arrests on 11 May.The men were named as William Lloyd, 39 and William Robinson, 35.They are accused of causing damages worth more than 100 million baht (£2.2m) to the broadcast rights holders.A third man, who is Thai, was also arrested and named as Supatra Raksasat, 33.Agents for the Department of Special Investigation (DSI) also seized nine computer servers, nine computers, 49 set-top boxes and three mobile phones.The three men allegedly sold illegal broadcasts of football matches on the 365sport.tv website, which is currently offline.Customers of 365sport.tv have discussed problems accessing the site in recent days via online forums.In a statement, the Premier League said that it had supported Thai police in efforts to crack down on the illegal use of Kodi and IPTV boxes.""This included a series of raids in Bangkok that targeted several website operators engaged in selling the devices that are pre-loaded with apps that facilitate pirate broadcasts of Premier League football, across South East Asia,"" the organisation said.""The Premier League is currently engaged in its largest ever programme to protect its copyright and the legitimate investment made by its broadcasting partners. ""Their contribution allows our clubs to develop and acquire players, invest in facilities and support the wider football pyramid and communities - all things that fans enjoy and society benefits from.""Deputy chief of the DSI, Suriya Singhakamol, said the suspects may also have been involved in transmissions broadcast via Thaiexpat.tv, Hkexpat.tv, Indoexpat.tv, Vietexpat.tx and Euroexpat.tv.The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office is aware of the situation.In March, the Premier League secured a court order in the UK that gave it the means to block computer servers used to host illegal streams.At the time, a spokesman said the organisation was prepared to target pirates in a ""precise manner""."
651,Thailand backs off lese-majeste Facebook ban threat,"Thailand has backed off from a threat to ban Facebook for failing to block illegal content, including posts critical of the monarchy.The social media network was given a deadline of 10:00 local time (04:00 GMT) to block 131 pages from being seen within Thailand.But Facebook, and the offending pages, remained accessible on Tuesday. Authorities said they held off from taking action as court orders were not delivered to Facebook in time.Authorities had issued their threat to ban and take legal action against Facebook last week.More than a third of the 131 pages were deemed to have violated Thailand's strict lese-majeste laws, which forbid insults to the royal family.The rest of the pages were identified to contain other kinds of illegal content such as pornography, phishing scams, and gambling. After the Tuesday morning deadline had passed, the secretary-general of the Thai telecom regulator Takorn Tantasith told reporters that criminal court orders had been issued for 34 pages, and authorities were seeking court orders for the other 97  pages.However, none of the documents had been sent to Facebook yet, added Mr Takorn from the National Broadcasting and Telecommunication Commission (NBTC), which meant the pages were still accessible in Thailand.He also told reporters that Facebook was ""co-operating with Thailand"". Facebook has yet to comment publicly on the matter.It isn't clear yet whether a new deadline for compliance has been set. Facebook has already blocked hundreds of posts considered offensive to the monarchy; thousands of websites have also been blocked. More than 100 people have been charged under the lese-majeste law since the military seized power three years ago.Acquittals are rare, and sentences of up to 30 years in prison have been given for using Facebook to post anti-monarchy comments.The government seems determined to ensure that no material it deems damaging to the monarchy is visible in Thailand, despite the challenge of doing this in an open economy, and in the digital information age. It is especially sensitive about photographs of the new King Maha Vajiralongkorn which have been circulated by some critics of the monarchy. The king, who succeeded his father last December, has had a colourful personal life, although the severe lese-majeste law makes any discussion of the monarchy impossible inside Thailand.Thailand's lese-majeste laws explainedIn 2015, when Facebook set up an office in Thailand, it said 34 million Thais were using Facebook every month, and that they posted three times more than the global average.Most social media monitoring companies predict the number of users in Thailand has grown significantly since then.The firm has previously said it carefully scrutinises requests made by governments wanting to restrict content. If it determines the content does violate local laws, it makes it unavailable in the country and notifies people who try to access it.In May 2014, days after the military coup, Thailand blocked access to Facebook, with the Information Communications Technology Ministry saying the order came from the military. The military denied this.The military government has increased censorship of online content since coming to power - especially criticism of the royal family.Last month it banned Thais making any contact or sharing content from three outspoken critics of the monarchy."
652,Thailand warns Facebook to block content critical of the monarchy,"Authorities in Thailand have warned Facebook to take down content critical of the monarchy, or face legal action. The social media giant has been given until next Tuesday to remove more than 130 items from pages viewable in Thailand. Facebook says it does consider requests from governments to block material, and will comply if it breaks local laws. Any comment critical of the monarchy can result in prosecution under Thailand's strict lese-majeste law.Those convicted face long prison sentences.Thailand's lese-majeste laws explainedDefaming a dog: The ways to get arrested for lese-majesteThailand's military government that seized power in Thailand in 2014 has made great efforts to suppress any criticism of the monarchy. Thousands of websites have been blocked, and people caught sharing, or even liking Facebook posts deemed unflattering to the monarchy have been prosecuted.  The National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission told the BBC that Facebook had already co-operated in blocking some pages, but that more than 130 judged to be illegal remained visible in Thailand. Last year, the country's deputy prime minister said Google agreed to co-operate with the removal of online content insulting Thailand's monarchy.The US internet company said it was following its existing policies on content removal.""When we are notified of content that is illegal through official processes, we will restrict it in the country where it's illegal after a thorough review,"" Google said at the time.Thailand's lese-majeste laws are intended to protect the most senior members of Thailand's royal family from insult or threat.Article 112 of the country's criminal code says anyone who ""defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir-apparent or the regent"" will be punished with up to 15 years in prison.Lese-majeste complaints can be filed by anyone against anyone, and they must always be formally investigated by the police.Trials are usually conducted in secret, and with almost no chance of being acquitted defendants usually plead guilty in the hope of reducing the sentence.More than 100 people have been charged with lese-majeste since the coup; seven were detained by the military last month, including a lawyer who is being charged on 10 counts of violating the law, carrying a punishment of up to 150 years in prison. Some of the recent arrests have related to posts on social media sites.A man faces 15 years in jail for posting images on Facebook in 2015 of then-King Bhumibol's favourite dog in a way that mocked the king, according to the prosecutor.And a cleaning lady is being charged for posting the words ""I see"" in an exchange on Facebook between her and a political activist that police say had defamatory comments."
653,Bangkok street food 'is what defines us',"Food stalls have long been part of Bangkok's culture, but a government plan to clean up the streets has got people worried.Reporter: Jonathan Head. Produced by: Daniel Bull, Miho Tanaka and Thanyarat Doksone"
654,Street food: Thai foodies defend Bangkok vendor culture,"In a city where eating well is an obsession, a statement by a senior official last month, published in a national newspaper, caused a public outcry. Vallop Suwandee, who chairs an advisory board to the governor of Bangkok, was quoted as saying that street vendors would be removed from all 50 districts of the city. It seemed that one of the most popular and distinctive aspects of Bangkok life was to be wiped out, days after CNN had voted Bangkok the best place in the world for street food, and just two months before the city government was planning to hold a street-food festival.Mr Vallop now says he was misquoted: ""Let me be clear, on behalf of the city of Bangkok. Street food will continue to be part of Bangkok life, on the condition that there will not be obstructions for pedestrians, and that the vendors observe sanitary rules in the interest of public health. ""We will allow them to be in certain areas, under strict conditions.""This is not the first time the Bangkok Metropolitan Authority (BMA), which is responsible for running the city, has tried to impose order and standards on the hundreds of thousands of food vendors operating on the streets. Right after the BMA was first established in 1972 it launched a similar campaign to force the vendors to operate in designated markets instead. Variations of that campaign were revived every few years but implementation has always been weak because the BMA recognised the vital role street vending played in providing a source of income in difficult economic times. Most of the time it has quietly chosen not to push too hard.This time may be different. The number of officially approved locations for street food vendors has been cut dramatically, from a peak of 726 four years ago to 243 by the end of last year. Tens of thousands of vendors have been forced to move already, leaving many downtown areas like Siam Square, Asok and Silom with few or no street-food stalls now visible during the day and night. The most recent area to be cleared is the increasingly wealthy neighbourhood of Thonglor. A small side street, or soi, which for many years had been famous for its street food, is no more, although city officials say the vendors were offered alternative locations in smaller sois further away. The BMA is not being specific about its ultimate plans but it looks as though it aims to have street-food confined to a very few well-known city-centre areas, like the backpacker hangout of Khao San Road and Yaowarat Road, which runs through the historic Chinatown area, and to be more widely permitted in outer city neighbourhoods. With growing numbers of tourists and commuters coming into the downtown area, Mr Vallop says there is not enough space for street vendors. A vendor may occupy a space where land prices run to many thousands of dollars per square metre, he told me - why should one person have that privilege? He said the BMA had received many complaints about blocked pavements.These arguments, though, have been lost in the furore over the perceived threat to the city's much-loved street-cuisine. Chawadee Nulkair is a self-styled street food fanatic who publishes a blog, bangkokglutton.com, cataloguing her culinary discoveries. She opposes the BMA's move against the vendors, even though she acknowledges the inconvenience to pedestrians.""As much as we complain about the clutter and the chaos,"" she told me, ""this is what defines us.""This street food is Thai culture. Motorbikes drive on the pavements here. Even without the vendors the pavements would still be awful."" Chawadee took me to Yaowarat Road, sometimes described as the birthplace of street food, and still one of the best places to eat in Bangkok. She explained how the Chinese immigrants, who settled in large numbers in the 19th Century, began cooking food along the roadsides to make a living, using simple stoves and iron woks. That style of cooking, along with classic Chinese ingredients like noodles, significantly changed Thai cooking. Street food has also become an essential service for the growing numbers of commuters, who may have long journeys to and from work, and limited time and space to cook at home.We passed a number of stalls sending out mouth-watering aromas into the night air, before settling on a stall Chawadee knew would cook an excellent prawn noodle hot pot, a classic Thai-Chinese dish. The kitchen was set out on the front steps of a bank, with the chef cooking fried rice and noodle dishes at lightning speed, sheets of flame curling around his blazing wok. The stall has been run by Voracha Rujarawan and her family for three generations. She is worried by the city government's plans. Already she has to make regular payments to local officials and the police. Now they are insisting she needs proper dish-washing facilities, although it is not clear how they can do that without running water. On cue, a uniformed municipal officer arrived and started questioning her at length about how she would meet the tougher new hygiene standards.The city's argument that public demand for better pedestrian access has also been challenged by a survey carried out by the Urban Design and Development Centre, a city planning project started by the architecture faculty at Chulalongkorn University, which is actually campaigning to make walking better in Bangkok. The UDDC Director, Niramon Kulsirisombat, says the survey of more than 1,000 respondents showed that food vendors were not considered the worst problem; in fact Bangkok's typically narrow pavements are such an obstacle course of electricity poles, hydrants, disused phone boxes and road signs that pedestrians usually find themselves walking in the road even without food stalls.She said there were too few channels for Bangkok's residents to have their views heard by the city government; that it took too much of a government-knows-best, top-down approach to development. This criticism has also been applied to the BMA's controversial decision to demolish a historic community in old Bangkok to make way for a tourist park, and its ambitious plan to build a concrete walkway 10m (33ft) wide and 14km (nine miles) long, along the bank of the Chaophraya river.""The reasons the BMA gives for moving the street food, blocking the pavements and hygiene, are not enough. Like Singapore 50 years ago, when Lee Kwan Yew began modernising the city, they said we have to move all this street food chaos, that it is a symbol of a third world country. But actually, in Bangkok, you should see street food as a form of life support for so many people."""

""He then came to the police station to report himself and gave testimony about the accident.""He said: ""We haven't pressed any charges at this point but we've questioned both the driver and the motorcycle driver.""From the CCTV footage, the motorcycle driver applied the brake quite abruptly and lost control of the vehicle.

""All of you who knew my dad will know that he went the way he wanted and no-one should feel sad, fly free my hero xx.""Harry Harrison, director of flight operations at Thai Sky Adventures, said the centre began its own investigation immediately after the incident on Thursday.Eyewitnesses told the centre they saw the man rolling onto his back and spinning in mid-air shortly after he jumped. His parachute was seen to be deployed, but he did not steer it as he drifted towards the ground. He missed the designated landing spot and landed in water. Mr Harrison said the man was pulled out within five minutes by a rescue team, who tried to revive him.It is the second death to have happened at Thai Sky Adventures, which opened in 2009. Last year a Russian instructor died during a jump, said Mr Harrison.He said the causes for both deaths could not be attributed to the centre.

He is accused of knocking down and killing a police officer in 2012.The untouchable Red Bull heir in ThailandA spokeswoman for the Singapore police told the BBC on Thursday that Mr Vorayuth ""is not in Singapore"".She added that they would ""provide the necessary assistance and support to the Thai authorities in accordance with our laws"".Thai police have summoned Mr Vorayuth multiple times to face charges, but he has repeatedly failed to attend these meetings.Mr Vorayuth's representatives have said each time that he was either away for business or too ill to meet police.Thai investigators are now seeking to cancel his passport.The case has attracted criticism that the Thai elite enjoy special treatment from authorities.Even if the Thai authorities try to bring Vorayuth Yoovidhaya back to face charges related to the hit-and-run killing of a policeman in 2012, the chances of him being sentenced, let alone imprisoned, are not high. Wealthy defendants in Thailand have shown time and again that they can evade justice.Ask Vatana Asavahame, a veteran politician who was given a 10-year sentence in 2008 for a notorious corruption case. He simply moved overseas, and has never served a day in prison.Or ask Somchai Khunpleum, better known as Kamnan Poh, the godfather who once controlled much of the business around Pattaya. He was convicted of ordering the murder of a political rival in 2004. But it was only in 2013 that the police caught him, at an expressway toll-booth, driving to Bangkok for routine medical treatment. He has since been allowed to serve his 30-year sentence in a hospital close to his home.Then there are the other cases of rich kids involved in road accidents.In July 2007 Kanpitak ""Moo Ham"" Patchimsawas, then 22, drove his Mercedes car into a crowd of passengers after an argument with the bus driver, killing one woman. He went to prison to serve a two-year sentence in only 2015.In December 2010 Orachorn Devahastin Na Ayudhya, then 16, collided with a minivan while driving without a licence. Nine passengers in the van died. She was given a suspended jail sentence and less than 200 hours of community service.Last year, a car driven by Janepob Veraporn was caught on a dashcam slamming at very high speed into the rear of another car in the slow lane of an expressway north of Bangkok. The other car burst into flames, killing the two postgraduate students inside. At the scene, Janepob was allowed by the police to refuse both a drug and alcohol test. After a massive public outcry, he was charged, and is currently on trial.By contrast, a middle-aged couple from Thailand's north-east caught after picking mushrooms in a national park in 2010 were each given a 15-year prison sentence. They confessed to illegal logging on the advice of their lawyer, who said it would reduce their sentence, but they say they took only the mushrooms. This week, their sentence was reduced to five years."
660,Thai fugitive Red Bull heir Vorayuth 'in Singapore',"Thai police say the heir to the Red Bull empire Vorayuth Yoovidhaya, who is wanted in Thailand over the death of a police officer, has fled to Singapore.Authorities have said he left last Tuesday, days before a warrant was issued for his arrest after he failed to show up to face charges.Mr Vorayuth allegedly knocked down the officer while speeding in 2012.The high-profile case has attracted criticism that the elite enjoy special treatment from Thai authorities.The untouchable Red Bull heir in ThailandSingaporean police and aviation authorities did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.The Associated Press news agency said Singapore airport authorities had confirmed with them that Mr Vorayuth's private plane was in the country as of Tuesday.A representative at Seletar Airport, which receives private aeroplanes, told the BBC that they were ""unable to release any information"" and declined to give a reason.Singapore does not have an extradition agreement with Thailand, but the two countries frequently co-operate in transnational cases.Mr Vorayuth has repeatedly failed to meet Thai police to face charges of speeding, reckless driving causing death, and fleeing the scene of an accident. Some charges have since expired.His representatives have said each time that he was either away for business or too ill to meet police.Thai news outlets quoted police as saying that Mr Vorayuth travelled to Singapore on 25 April, and that they were unable to stop him as this was before the warrant was issued on Friday.A police spokesman also told The Nation newspaper that they did not put in place a travel ban as the case was about recklessness rather than one of criminal intent.Thai investigators are now seeking to cancel Mr Vorayuth's passport."
661,Turbulence injures 27 on Aeroflot flight to Bangkok,"At least 27 people were hurt when an Aeroflot flight from Moscow to Bangkok hit a patch of severe turbulence.No injuries were life-threatening, but several passengers suffered broken bones and three needed surgery, Russian officials said.A passenger described being ""hurled"" up to the ceiling, trying to cling on amid shaking which ""wouldn't stop"".The turbulence occurred in clear skies, which meant the crew were not able to warn passengers, the airline said.""The reasons behind the injures were that some of the passengers had not had their seatbelts fastened,"" Aeroflot said in a statement.Mobile phone footage of the aftermath of the incident showed injured people lying in the aisles, with packets of food and other items scattered on the floor.""We were hurled up into the roof of the plane, it was practically impossible to hold on,"" a passenger who gave her first name as Yevgenia told Rossiya 24 by phone.""It felt like the shaking wouldn't stop, that we would just crash,"" she added.The pilot, Aleksandr Ruzov, said the turbulence was ""impossible to predict"", in an interview with the Russia 24 news channel.He said the worst effects were felt at the back of the plane.CAT - clear air turbulence - is turbulence that occurs in otherwise calm, clear blue skies, without any visual indication such as clouds.It is caused when masses of air moving at different speeds meet, and can't be identified by the naked eye or conventional radar.Pilots use reports from other aircraft, passed on via air traffic control, to keep track of patches of clear air turbulence.Why is in-flight turbulence so unpredictable?Atlantic turbulence 'to hit flights', climate scientists sayThe incident took place about 40 minutes before the Boeing 777 carrying 313 passengers was due to land in Bangkok.Twenty-four of those injured were Russians while the other three were Thai, the Russian embassy in Thailand said.Fifteen people, including one child, were admitted to hospitals in Bangkok, a health ministry spokesman told the Russian news agency Interfax.Three people needed surgery, two for multiple leg fractures and one for broken ribs, he said.By early evening on Monday, 14 passengers remained in hospital, according to Aeroflot, which has said it will pay the medical costs of the injured.The airline said the pilot's experience amounted to more than 23,000 flight hours and that about 750 cases of clear-air turbulence are recorded in civil aviation every year."
662,Sudden turbulence hits Aeroflot Moscow-Bangkok flight,"Severe turbulence has left 27 people injured during a flight from Moscow to Bangkok, Russian officials say.There was apparently no warning before the incident, which happened in clear skies shortly before the Aeroflot flight landed in the Thai capital on Monday.The Russian embassy said while no one suffered serious injuries, those with fractures and bruising had had their seat belts unfastened."
663,Thai court seeks Red Bull heir arrest after five years,"A Thai court has issued an arrest warrant for Red Bull heir Vorayuth Yoovidhaya, in a move critics say is long overdue.Mr Vorayuth is accused of knocking down and killing a policeman while speeding in Bangkok in 2012.He has repeatedly failed to meet police to face charges, which include reckless driving causing death.The closely watched case has fuelled criticism that Thailand's elite enjoy special treatment by the authorities.Mr Vorayuth is the grandson of Chaleo Yoovidhaya, who co-founded the Red Bull empire with Austrian Dietrich Mateschitz.The untouchable Red Bull heir in ThailandHe was first arrested shortly after the incident and later let go. He was subsequently summoned repeatedly to face charges, but each time his lawyers said he was unable to do so, citing overseas work commitments and illness. A charge for speeding has since expired.Prosecutors asked police to request the arrest warrant after he failed to meet another deadline on Thursday. ""A court in Bangkok has approved the request and we've entered the arrest warrant into the system, meaning that police all over the country will be searching for him,"" Police Col Kajohnpong Jitparkpoom, the superintendent of Thong Lor police district, told the BBC. ""But if he is found to be overseas, then the prosecutors will have to initiate the procedure to have him extradited, if possible.""If found guilty of reckless driving causing death, a charge which expires in 2027, he could be jailed for up to 10 years.Many Thais have questioned why the police have not tried to arrest Mr Vorayuth before now to face charges.Before the arrest warrant was issued, the office of the attorney-general said it would explore applying for extradition of Mr Vorayuth, who it said was recently seen in London, if a warrant was issued."
664,Wives wanted in the Faroe Islands,"There's a shortage of women in the Faroe Islands. So local men are increasingly seeking wives from further afield - Thailand and the Philippines in particular. But what's it like for the brides who swap the tropics for this windswept archipelago?When Athaya Slaetalid first moved from Thailand to the Faroe Islands, where winter lasts six months, she would sit next to the heater all day:""People told me to go outside because the sun was shining but I just said: 'No! Leave me alone, I'm very cold.'"" Moving here six years ago was tough for Athaya at first, she admits. She'd met her husband Jan when he was working with a Faroese friend who had started a business in Thailand. Jan knew in advance that bringing his wife to this very different culture, weather and landscape would be challenging.Listen to Wives Wanted in the Faroes on BBC Radio 4's Crossing Continents at 11:00 on Thursday 27 April - or catch up on BBC iPlayer RadioThe programme can also be heard on Assignment on BBC World Service""I had my concerns, because everything she was leaving and everything she was coming to were opposites,"" he admits. ""But knowing Athaya, I knew she would cope.""There are now more than 300 women from Thailand and Philippines living in the Faroes. It doesn't sound like a lot, but in a population of just 50,000 people they now make up the largest ethnic minority in these 18 islands, located between Norway and Iceland.In recent years the Faroes have experienced population decline, with young people leaving, often in search of education, and not returning. Women have proved more likely to settle abroad. As a result, according to Prime Minister Axel Johannesen, the Faroes have a ""gender deficit"" with approximately 2,000 fewer women than men. This, in turn, has lead Faroese men to look beyond the islands for romance. Many, though not all, of the Asian women met their husbands online, some through commercial dating websites. Others have made connections through social media networks or existing Asian-Faroese couples.For the new arrivals, the culture shock can be dramatic. Officially part of the Kingdom of Denmark, the Faroes have their own language (derived from Old Norse) and a very distinctive culture - especially when it comes to food. Fermented mutton, dried cod and occasional whale meat and blubber are typical of the strong flavours here, with none of the traditional herbs and spices of Asian cooking. And, although it never gets as cold as neighbouring Iceland, the wet, cool climate is a challenge for many people. A good summer's day would see the temperature reach 16°C. Athaya is a confident woman with a ready smile who now works in the restaurant business in Torshavn, the Faroese capital. She and Jan share a cosy cottage on the banks of a fjord surrounded by dramatic mountains. But she's honest about how difficult swapping countries was at first. ""When our son Jacob was a baby, I was at home all day with no-one to talk to,"" she says. ""The other villagers are older people and mostly don't speak English. People our age were out at work and there were no children for Jacob to play with. I was really alone. When you stay at home here, you really stay at home. I can say I was depressed. But I knew it would be like that for two or three years."" Then, when Jacob started kindergarten, she began working in catering and met other Thai women. ""That was important because it gave me a network. And it gave me a taste of home again.""Krongrak Jokladal felt isolated at first, too, when she arrived from Thailand. Her husband Trondur is a sailor and works away from home for several months at a time. She started her own Thai massage salon in the centre of Torshavn. ""You can't work regular hours with a baby, and although my parents-in-law help out with childcare, running the business myself means I can choose my hours,"" she says. It's a far cry from Krongrak's previous job as head of an accountancy division in Thai local government.But she is unusual in that she runs her own business. Even for many highly educated Asian women in the Faroes, the language barrier means they have to take lower-level work.Axel Johannesen, the prime minister, says helping the newcomers overcome this is something the government takes seriously. ""The Asian women who have come in are very active in the labour market, which is good,"" he says. ""One of our priorities is to help them learn Faroese, and there are government programmes offering free language classes.""Kristjan Arnason recalls the effort his Thai wife Bunlom, who arrived in the Faroes in 2002, put into learning the language.""After a long day at work she would sit reading the English-Faeroese dictionary,"" he says. ""She was extraordinarily dedicated."" ""I was lucky,"" Bunlom adds. ""I told Kristjan that if I was moving here he had to find me a job. And he did, and I was working with Faeroese people in a hotel so I had to learn how to talk to them."" In an age when immigration has become such a sensitive topic in many parts of Europe, Faeroes society seems remarkably accepting of foreign incomers.""I think it helps that the immigrants we have seen so far are mostly women,"" says local politician Magni Arge, who also sits in the Danish parliament, ""They come and they work and they don't cause any social problems. ""But we've seen problems when you have people coming from other cultures into places like the UK, in Sweden and in other parts of Europe - even Denmark. That's why we need to work hard at government level to make sure we don't isolate people and have some kind of sub-culture developing.""But Antonette Egholm, originally from the Philippines, hasn't encountered any anti-immigrant sentiment. I met her and her husband as they moved into a new flat in Torshavn.""People here are friendly, she explains, ""and I've never experienced any negative reactions to my being a foreigner. I lived in metro Manila and there we worried about traffic and pollution and crime. Here we don't need to worry about locking the house, and things like healthcare and education are free. At home we have to pay. And here you can just call spontaneously at someone's house, it's not formal. For me, it feels like the Philippines in that way.""Likewise, her husband Regin believes increasing diversity is something that should be welcomed not feared. ""We actually need fresh blood here,"" he adds, ""I like seeing so many children now who have mixed parentage. Our gene pool is very restricted, and it's got to be a good thing that we welcome outsiders who can have families.""He acknowledges that he's had occasional ribbing from some male friends who jokingly ask if he pressed ""enter"" on his computer to order a wife. But he denies he and Antonette have encountered any serious prejudice as a result of their relationship.Athaya Slaetalid tells me that some of her Thai friends have asked why she doesn't leave her small hamlet, and move to the capital, where almost 40% of Faroe Islanders now live. They say Jacob would have more friends there. ""No, I don't need to do that,"" she says. ""I'm happy here now, not just surviving but making a life for our family. ""Look,"" she says, as we step into the garden overlooking the fjord. ""Jacob plays next to the beach. He is surrounded by hills covered in sheep and exposed to nature. And his grandparents live just up the road. There is no pollution and no crime. Not many kids have that these days. This could be the last paradise on earth.""Tim Ecott is the author of Stealing Water, Neutral Buoyancy: Adventures in a Liquid World and Vanilla: Travels in Search of the Luscious Substance.Join the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter."
665,Facebook baby killing: Grief and questions after shocking murder,"An incident as shocking as a man murdering his 11-month-old daughter live on Facebook before killing himself was bound to provoke heated debate. The 21-year-old man broadcast himself hanging his daughter from a half-finished building on the island of Phuket in Thailand, reportedly after ending a turbulent and sometimes violent relationship with his wife.The man's Facebook page has received dozens of comments from Thai people outraged by the death of the little girl. Some men who have also had failed relationships have posted how they got through their problems and rebuilt bonds with their children. Thais are accustomed to seeing violent scenes on their television news bulletins, which would be deemed unacceptable in many Western countries. Previous shocking incidents, like appalling car accidents caused by negligent driving, have led to brief national debates, but have quickly dropped from public consciousness. But there have been some reflective responses to this incident, with a number of people urging people not to share the video. The long period of time the video remained viewable on Facebook - 24 hours - is one area the social media giant may be able to address. Thai police were aware of the video almost immediately after the crime took place. It is not clear yet when the Thai authorities alerted Facebook. The police now say that in future they will discuss inappropriate online content with social media companies like Facebook, YouTube or Instagram, and how to take it down quickly. But the challenge of stopping offensive and disturbing content on a medium, which is used by so many people, including two-thirds of the Thai population, is a difficult one.The Thai military government does operate a range of censorship regimes, and blocks many thousands of websites, especially those carrying content deemed critical of the monarchy. On the day this awful incident occurred, the Ministry of Digital Information and Economy demanded that local internet service providers (ISPs) do even more to block anti-monarchy content, and the government is believed to be trying to implement a single digital gateway which will allow it to wall Thailand off from such content.But until now it has been wary of tampering with Facebook. A clumsy attempt to block Facebook shortly after the military had seized power in 2014 provoked a huge public outcry, and the social media giant remained unavailable for only 30 minutes. Aside from the general popularity of Facebook for social communication, it is also used by large numbers of Thai businesses to promote their products and services.Until now there has been little public debate over the negative sides of social media, for example hate speech, trolling and fake news, which have aggravated Thailand's bitter political polarisation. There is no law against hate speech.So Thai society is less prepared to address issues like those thrown up by this murder-suicide.A more fruitful area for discussion coming out of this incident might instead be the issue of domestic violence in Thailand, and the high level of suicides related to it. The Thai Department of Mental Health reports that there are around 350 suicides a month here, a figure it says it is working to reduce. Four times as many men than women are victims of suicide, and the highest number of those male suicides are related to relationship problems, and reactions to being criticised or insulted, or loss of face. The department says alcohol consumption also plays a big role in encouraging these men to kill themselves, and that it is very common for them to assault others, usually family members, before they do."
666,Thai man kills baby on Facebook Live then takes own life,"A Thai man filmed himself killing his baby daughter on Facebook Live, before taking his own life, Thai police say.The 21-year-old hanged his daughter, and then himself, at a deserted hotel in Phuket on Monday, reportedly after an argument with his wife.Facebook sent condolences to the family for the ""appalling"" incident and said that the content had now been removed.The company pledged a review of its processes after footage of a US killing stayed online for hours this month.The footage of the Thai killing had also been available on video sharing website YouTube, but the company took it down after the BBC alerted it to its presence.Relatives of the Thai man, Wuttisan Wongtalay, saw the distressing footage and alerted the police - but the authorities arrived too late to save him and his daughter.In a statement, a Facebook spokesperson said: ""This is an appalling incident and our hearts go out to the family of the victim. There is absolutely no place for content of this kind on Facebook and it has now been removed.""Zuckerberg addresses US 'Facebook killing'Facebook to review violent content policiesUS killer a 'monster' who 'just snapped'Reuters said two videos were posted, at 16:50 (09:50 GMT) and 16:57 on Monday, and were taken down at about 17:00 on Tuesday, roughly 24 hours later. Facebook has yet to confirm the times to the BBC.Thailand's ministry of digital economy said it had contacted Facebook on Tuesday afternoon about removing the videos.Ministry spokesman Somsak Khaosuwan told Reuters: ""We will not be able to press charges against Facebook, because Facebook is the service provider and they acted according to their protocol when we sent our request. They co-operated very well.""YouTube said it had taken down the video within 15 minutes of being told of its presence by the BBC.Its statement read: ""YouTube has clear policies that outline what's acceptable to post and we quickly remove videos that break our rules when they're flagged.""Shortly before the BBC alerted YouTube, the video was showing 2,351 views.Thai social media users reacted with anger to the footage, while offering condolences to the family of the girl, BBC Thai editor Nopporn Wong-Anan says.Devastated relatives of the child, including the mother, picked up the body of the girl and her father from hospital on Tuesday.Following the US killing, Facebook said it was ""constantly exploring ways that new technologies can help us make sure Facebook is a safe environment"". ""We prioritise reports with serious safety implications for our community, and are working on making that review process go even faster,"" blogged one of its executives last week.Separately on Tuesday, a court in Sweden jailed three men over the gang-rape of a woman in the city of Uppsala, 80km (50 miles) north of Stockholm, earlier this year and its live-streaming on Facebook.One man was jailed for two years and four months, and another for one year, both for rape. The third was jailed for six months for posting the rape on Facebook and failing to report it. This latest atrocity comes less than a fortnight after a US man bragged on Facebook Live about his murder of a 74-year-old man in Cleveland, having also posted a video of the killing to the social network.The platform's chief, Mark Zuckerberg, subsequently acknowledged he had ""a lot of work"" to do after it emerged the murder clip had remained online for more than two hours despite Facebook having received complaints in the meantime.Prior to that, Facebook Live broadcast the death of a Chicago man who was shot in the neck and head last June, and then in July a woman streamed the death of her boyfriend after he was shot by police in Minneapolis.There have also been reports of sexual assaults, animal abuse and teenage suicide having been shown.For its part, Facebook is trying to find ways for its review team - which employs thousands of people - to react to such content more quickly.In addition, the firm has developed software to prevent such footage being reshared in full on its service at a later point. And it is also exploring the use of artificial intelligence to automatically flag videos and photos that need to be reviewed rather than waiting for other users to report them.What it hasn't discussed is the idea of scrapping Facebook Live altogether. With Twitter and YouTube, among others, offering rival live-streaming products, doing so could put it at a disadvantage.But as a result, there will inevitably be further outrages and criticism because Facebook Live's popularity makes it all but impossible for the firm to keep a human eye over each broadcast."
667,Thai beach murders: Convicted men given longer to appeal,"Two men who face the death penalty in Thailand for murdering two British tourists have had their appeal deadline extended.The bodies of backpackers Hannah Witheridge, 23, from Norfolk, and David Miller, 24, from Jersey, were found on a beach on Koh Tao in September 2014.In 2015 Burmese bar workers Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo, also known as Win Zaw Tun, were found guilty of the killings.Their lawyers have until 23 May to file an appeal with the Supreme Court.A Thai appeal court upheld the death sentences given to the two men in March.Lawyers had been given 30 days to appeal to the Supreme Court, Thailand's final court of appeal.The men claim DNA evidence used to secure their conviction was unsound and a forensic investigator previously testified that evidence had been improperly collected.Lawyers for the convicted men have said they can still challenge the verdict, but because the defence team claims it is working on such limited resources they need more time to prepare a large amount of technical documents.Miss Witheridge, a University of Essex student from Hemsby near Great Yarmouth, and Mr Miller, a civil and structural engineering graduate from the University of Leeds, were found on a beach bludgeoned to death.A post-mortem examination showed Miss Witheridge had been raped."
668,"Isle of Man tourist found dead on beach in Phuket, Thailand","A tourist from the Isle of Man has been found dead on a beach in Thailand, according to local media.The Phuket News said Scott Robert Townsend, from Douglas, was pulled from the water on Patong Beach, which is on Phuket's west coast, on Friday.The 37-year-old, who had been due to fly home from the island on Saturday, had been on holiday with friends.The Foreign Office said it was ""assisting the family of a British man who sadly died in Patong, Thailand"".Mr Townsend's cause of death has not yet been established.Tributes to him have appeared on social media.One friend wrote: ""Devastating news. So tragic. Another absolutely smashing lad taken far too soon.""Another added: ""I am absolutely gutted to hear this news, Scott Townsend was a great friend."""
669,Inside Thailand's elephant hospital,"The world's first elephant hospital opened in Thailand in 1993. Since then it has treated about 4,000 elephants for a variety of ailments from diarrhoea to cataracts and even cancer.Other elephants arrive at the hospital with serious injuries from knives or gunshot wounds. Some also have to be fitted with prosthetic limbs after treading on landmines.The Travel Show's Henry Golding went to visit the hospital in Lampang, Northern Thailand to find out more."
670,Thai police arrest man smuggling semen into Laos,"Thai police have arrested a man attempting to smuggle six vials of human semen into Laos.Authorities found a nitrogen tank containing the vials in the man's bag when he was crossing the border at the northern Thai town of Nong Khai.Police said the man confessed that the semen was bound for a fertility clinic in the capital of Laos - Vientiane.Laos has seen a boom in commercial surrogacy after neighbouring Thailand and Cambodia banned the practice. The semen was collected from Chinese and Vietnamese men, police said.The smuggler, a Thai national, told police he had done 12 similar trips in the past year where he would collect semen from Bangkok clinics and transport them to the clinic in Laos, reported The Bangkok Post newspaper.He said he had also done several deliveries to a hospital in Cambodia, the paper reported.In 2015, Thailand banned foreigners from paying Thai women to act as surrogates following a string of scandals in the once thriving industry. Cambodia followed with a total ban last year.This has coincided with a rise in the number of Laos-linked surrogacy agencies and fertility clinics, reported AFP news agency."
671,The mystery of the missing brass plaque,"For more than 80 years a small brass plaque, no larger than a dinner plate, sat embedded in the tarmac in front of Bangkok's Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall, worn down after being driven over countless of times by traffic. Very few Thais even knew of its existence, apart from dedicated pro-democracy activists who would occasionally clean the plaque or decorate it with flowers.Yet the plaque is one of the very few monuments to mark the most significant moment in modern Thai history.In June 1932, a revolution overthrew 700 years of absolute monarchy and a constitutional political structure, requiring non-royal governments elected by the people, was introduced. Four-and-a-half years later, one of the leaders of that uprising and the first post-revolution prime minister Phraya Phahol held a small ceremony, embedding the plaque into the ground at the spot where he had first announced the end of the absolute monarchy. The inscription on it read: ""Here on 24 June 1932 at dawn, the People's Party proclaimed a constitution for the country's advancement.""Earlier this month two teams of students from Kasetsart University were sent by their professor to study the plaque.The first group, on 2 April, found it intact. A second group who visited it on 8 April discovered that it had been replaced.Neatly cemented in the same spot was a new plaque, with a different message: ""To love and respect the Buddhist trinity, one's own state, one's own family, and to have a heart faithful to your monarch, will bring prosperity to the country"". The same inscription surrounds the Chakri Star, a symbol of the reigning dynasty in Thailand.Unsurprisingly there has been an uproar, as pro-democracy activists, historians and social media commentators have protested against this apparent violation of a piece of Thailand's historic heritage. This was no casual act of vandalism. A fringe, ultra-royalist group had threatened to remove the plaque last year, but given the location, it seems unlikely even they would dare carry out their threat without significant official backing.The instigators of the 1932 revolution had chosen the location for their early morning announcement with care. Symbols, and locations, have always mattered in Thai power politics. Royal Plaza was the dramatic entrance to the new district of Dusit, built by Thailand's greatest absolute monarch, Chulalongkorn, as a more modern centre of royal power, away from the glittering palaces by the river. It marks the end of Ratchadamnoen Avenue, the grand royal boulevard connecting the two districts, and is dominated by a large statue of King Chulalongkorn astride a horse. The little brass plaque, stuck right next to the statue, was a deliberate snub, by a government determined to curb, or even end, royal power.But they failed. During the long reign of King Bhumibol, which ended with his death last October, royal power and prestige were restored to levels unknown since the days of absolute kings. Royal Plaza remains a potent symbol of the monarchy's elevated status. The new King Vajiralongkorn chose the imposing throne hall to host an elaborate formal ceremony, unseen in almost half a century, on 6 April, giving his royal approval to a new constitution drafted by Thailand's military rulers.Thailand's new King Vajiralongkorn in profileHow King Bhumibol shaped modern ThailandPhotographs published in the Thai media suggest the plaque was removed on the night before that ceremony.The reaction of the Thai authorities to the theft has left people perplexed. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha dismissed it as unimportant. ""What good will it do to demand its return?"" he responded to journalists, adding warnings not to organise protests about the plaque.The police insisted they could not investigate the disappearance because they did not know who owned the plaque. The deputy police chief even suggested that it had originally been put illegally in Royal Plaza, even though it was done by the government of the day.One activist who turned up at Royal Plaza to protest was detained; an opposition politician, who posted that the plaque was a national asset and should be protected by law, is being charged under the tough Computer Crimes Act.Two more who filed a complaint to the local police were warned not to go there, and instead bussed to Bangkok City Hall, where they were told that all 11 CCTV cameras in the area had been removed days before the plaque was taken. For a few hours a fence was erected around the new plaque to stop people photographing it, until the police realised it was a hazard to traffic, and took it down.Because 1932 was such a pivotal moment in Thai history, it has long been the subject of debate among the country's main political factions, each aiming to co-opt the event to enhance its own legitimacy.Some of the language used by the leaders of the uprising was stridently critical of the monarchy. It could hardly be republished now, under the exceptionally harsh interpretation of the lese majeste law used by today's military government. But very quickly the uprising's leaders decided they needed the endorsement of their new regime by then-King Prajadhipok, softening their proposals to limit royal powers in the constitution they finalised by the end of 1932.Relations between the two remained tense, with a failed royalist uprising in 1933 leading to the king eventually abdicating two years later. That chaotic start to Thailand's first attempt at democracy has allowed royalists to present it more as a gift from a caring monarchy, and for democrats and republicans to present democracy as something that must stem from the will of the people.In many ways, Thailand's recent political turmoil reflects a debate over the true source of political legitimacy in the country which has never been settled.So whoever removed the little brass plaque, with its brief homage to the first ""people's constitution"", was sending a message, or adjusting the symbolic balance in Royal Plaza. The evasive responses of the government and police show it is a very sensitive matter that they are reluctant to investigate.

673,Thai military warns against online contact with prominent critics,"Thailand's military government has warned its citizens against online interaction with three prominent critics, saying they could face prosecution. In an unprecedented move, the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society advised against following, contacting or sharing content from the three men. Those who did could be in violation of the Computer Crimes Act, it warned.A rights group said it ""showed brazen determination to silence dissent"".The three people are historian Somsak Jeamteerasakul, academic Pavin Chachavanpongpun and journalist Andrew MacGregor Marshall.Thailand's Lese Majeste laws explainedThai man faces trial over Facebook shareAll three currently live outside Thailand and are active on social media. They have spoken about the military government, the monarchy and the use of the Lese Majeste law - strict regulations that block any criticism of the royal institution but which rights groups say are used to stifle dissent. An official from the ministry, Somsak Khaosuwan, said the order was to ""benefit the people so they can search for the right information... and use their judgement so that it (the order) will not affect them"".But Amnesty International, in a statement, said Thai authorities had ""plunged to fresh depths in restricting people's freedoms of expression"". ""After imprisoning people for what they say both online and offline, and hounding critics into exile, they want to cut people off from each other altogether,"" Deputy Director for South East Asia and the Pacific Josef Benedict said.  Thailand has been run by the military since it ousted an elected civilian government in 2014. Widely-revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who had spent decades on the throne, died in October 2016. He has been succeeded by his son, King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who is yet to enjoy the same level of popularity as his father. In its latest report in March, the UN Human Rights Committee expressed concern about freedom of expression in Thailand. It called on Thailand to stop using criminal defamation laws and provisions such as the Computer Crimes Act as ""tools to suppress the expression of critical and dissenting opinions""."
674,"Thailand's constitution: New era, new uncertainties","When a country has gone through 19 constitutions in less than a century, the official launch of its 20th risks being a non-event. The nonchalance with which Thailand has brushed off repeated coups and constitutional rewrites makes it hard for outsiders to take the arrival of yet another charter seriously.But the military government, which has ruled Thailand since the 2014 coup, is taking this constitution very seriously indeed.Right after seizing power, the generals announced their intention to restructure the country, in such a way, they said, that they would never have to mount another coup. We failed to fix things permanently after our last (2006) coup, they told us at the time - this time we have to get it right.Their first attempt in 2015 failed, after the junta itself withdrew its own draft charter, fearful that it might not win sufficient support in the referendum they had promised the public. Last August they tried again. This time they made sure their amended draft would pass, by imposing a strict ban on any campaigning, so the public understood very little about it, and by warning that the only alternative was extended military rule.Why Thais said yes to new constitution Profile: Thailand's new king How King Bhumibol shaped modern ThailandBut even after the referendum, the constitution has been altered again at the request of the new king, Maha Vajiralongkorn, who succeeded to the throne after the death of his father King Bhumibol last October. This overt intervention by the monarch was unexpected. The changes restore royal influence over important procedures, for example over the appointment of a regent, if the king is overseas or incapacitated, and at times of acute political crisis.The King presided over an elaborate signing ceremony at the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall in Bangkok, where the first steps in ending the absolute monarchy took place in 1932. It was held on Chakri Day, which commemorates the current royal dynasty, and the palace requested a 21-gun salute and for prayers to be chanted by Buddhist monks in temples around the country. By contrast the last constitution in 2007 was quietly signed by his father just days after the referendum. By doing this King Vajiralongkorn appears to want to link this charter, in the minds of the Thai public, with the start of his reign, making it a central part of the historic political transition brought on by the death of King Bhumibol.Weaker governmentsSo what was it that the military wanted to fix in this constitution? The two issues of concern most commonly cited by the government and its supporters are political conflict and corruption. But after examining the substance of the 279-clause document, its main target appears to be politicians, and their parties. ""We saw the past constitutions where the Thai people were very happy with their rights and freedoms fully protected"", explained Norachit Sinhaseni, spokesman for the Constitutional Drafting Committee. ""Those constitutions did not last because of the way the politicians and political parties interacted with each other. What this constitution attempts to do is to find safety valves.""The new charter introduces a different electoral system, a modified proportional method of choosing the 500 members of the lower house of parliament in which people vote for one of 350 constituency candidates; those votes are totalled to determine which of the remaining 150 party list seats go to which party. Under the previous system voters cast two ballots, one for the candidate and one for the party.This is likely to increase the seats held by medium-sized parties, but significantly reduce the seats held by the party of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, which won every election held since 2001. Weakening Mr Thaksin and his allies was an undeclared, but barely disguised, objective of the coup-makers. Under the new system Thailand is more likely to have fractious coalition governments, as it did back in the 1990s.Along with weaker governments, the constitution stipulates that an unelected, 250-seat upper house, or senate, will wield significant influence in the years following the election, currently expected at the end of 2018. Membership of the senate will be essentially determined by the military, giving the generals enormous sway over future governments, which would need three quarters of the seats in the lower house to have a majority in both houses.Elected governments will also be bound in this constitution to follow the military's 20-year blueprint for Thailand, and it will be easier for the ""independent"" bodies, like the Constitutional Court, which will have enhanced powers, to constrain those governments even further. It is not hard to see this charter as a straitjacket around any elected administration. Even the man who oversaw its drafting, Meechai Ruchupan, described it as ""strong medicine"" which would not be popular with political parties. Academic Prinya Thaewanarumitkul from Thammasat University argues that it will create a ""hybrid"" political system, only partially democratic. He believes it will fail to address the deep political rifts in Thai society.""Our checks and balances have not worked well,"" he says, ""so the drafters of the constitution have tried to write down what everyone should do and not do, in a document running to 42,000 words. ""But few people can read such a long constitution, so they do not understand the new rules, they cannot control the way the game is played. They will feel left out.""Tyrell Haberkorn, a fellow of the Department of Political & Social Change at the Australian National University who has written extensively on Thailand, is more critical.""Despite claims by the junta otherwise,"" she writes, ""the new constitution creates a permanent place for the military in government and seeks to normalise their intervention. ""From start to finish - the drafting by a select group, the strict control of discussion of the draft, and the last minute amendments - the new constitution risks institutionalising authoritarianism rather than paving the way for democracy.""These concerns have been repeated by other academics, Thai politicians and legal experts. But they will carry little weight with a military government which has, time and again, said it prioritises maintaining stability through a difficult transition over democratic principles.Thais are left with one certainty, and two uncertainties, as this constitution comes into effect. The certainty is that the armed forces will try to retain the whip-hand over future governments for at least another decade.The two uncertainties are over, firstly, how the new king will play his part. He is a very different personality from his father, and has already raised eyebrows by requesting changes to the constitution. The dynamic between him, the armed forces and future governments could profoundly reshape Thai politics.Second, no one knows how strong the residual support is for Thaksin Shinawatra and his allies. In two previous elections, in late 2007 and in 2011, pro-Thaksin parties did better than expected. Even with the tighter constraints imposed by the new charter, once political activity is permitted again, it is possible that parties could rebuild sufficient popular support to challenge those constraints."
675,Thailand king signs constitution paving way for polls,"The king of Thailand has signed a new constitution that paves the way for a return to democracy but still gives the army an influential role in politics.King Maha Vajiralongkorn signed the document at a ceremony in Bangkok.It constrains future elected governments with an appointed senate, and commits governments to follow the military's 20-year development plan.The last constitution was abolished after the military seized power nearly three years ago. Critics claim the new document only allows for a partial, guided democracy.It was approved by a referendum last August. Elections could now be held next year.Thailand has had so many constitutions in its modern history - this is the 20th since 1932 - that many of them were introduced with little fanfare, reports the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok.But King Vajiralongkorn, who succeeded his father last year, signalled royal approval for the new charter by requesting an elaborate ceremony for its signing. The king had requested changes to the charter earlier this year that restore some significant areas of royal influence.The edits remove a power that would have been granted to the constitutional court to call a meeting in the event of a political crisis.A requirement that the king appoint a regent when he leaves the country was also removed. The king often spends time in Germany, where a son attends school.The generals say they need to impose some limits on democratic practice in order to prevent the need for military coups in the future.Thailand's military has a history of intervening in politics and has seized power 12 times since the end of the absolute monarchy - and the introduction of the first constitution - in 1932.It has promised not to intervene after the next elections, which have been delayed many times."
676,The untouchable Red Bull heir in Thailand," Among the many uncertainties hanging over Thailand as it is steered hesitantly through a delicate political transition, its people could be sure of one thing this week.That Vorayuth Yoovidhaya, the grandson of the billionaire who invented the energy drink Red Bull, would once again fail to appear at a Bangkok prosecutor's office to face charges relating to the death of a police officer.On 3 September 2012, that officer was struck by a Ferrari driven by Mr Vorayuth.The sometimes farcical attempts by the Thai authorities to bring Mr Vorayuth to justice are now commonly cited as epitomising the untouchability of the super-rich in Thailand.The facts of the incident early on the morning of 3 September are reasonably clear. Police Sergeant-Major Wichian Klanprasert was riding his motorbike along Bangkok's Sukhumvit Road when he was hit by a grey Ferrari, which dragged his body more than 100m (109yds) down the road, before driving off. Investigating officers followed a trail of brake fluid to a luxury home less than a kilometre away, owned by one of Thailand's wealthiest families.The badly-dented Ferrari was there, but initially the police were persuaded to detain a driver employed by the family as their main suspect.When they subsequently discovered the car had actually been driven by Mr Vorayuth, then 27 years old, he was tested and found to have excessive alcohol in his blood - but, he said, this was from drinking at home after the accident. The police believe from security camera videos, the distance the car travelled after the crash, and the injuries that instantly killed Sergeant-Major Wichian, that Mr Vorayuth must have been speeding, they estimate at around 170km/h (106mph) in an 80km/h zone. His lawyers have denied this.It took the police six months to prepare criminal charges of speeding, reckless driving causing death, and fleeing the scene of an accident. Throughout 2013, Mr Vorayuth failed to appear seven times to hear the charges, with his lawyers providing an array of justifications, from him being on business overseas to feeling unwell. In September 2013 the limitation period for the speeding charge expired.Mr Vorayuth's grandfather, Chaleo Yoovidhya, made his fortune when, in the mid-1980s, he teamed up with an Austrian marketing executive to turn his energy drink known as Kratindaeng, or Red Bull, into a global sales success. Today the extended Yoovidhya family is believed to be worth more than $20bn (£16bn). The Red Bull logo is now seen all over the world, in particular sponsoring spectacular stunts and sporting events. But the family has shunned the limelight; before his death in March 2012 Chaleo Yoovidhya never gave a single media interview. After the accident, his grandson, Mr Vorayuth, vanished from public view.But social media posts by him and his jet-setting friends suggest he has often been inside Thailand, as well as travelling around the world to motor racing competitions or beach resorts. Life and death on Thailand's lethal roadsMexico newspaper stops printing after reporter shot deadThe Afghan restaurant run by domestic abuse survivorsHow Russia's YouTube generation is getting its newsRight after the accident the police chief of Bangkok at that time, Kamronwit Thoopkrajang, promised the public that the culprit in Sergeant-Major Wichian's death would be brought to justice, or he would resign. In April 2013 the attorney-general promised to indict Mr Vorayuth, only to backtrack after he was petitioned by the suspect's lawyers, who contested the fairness of the speeding charge. In September 2013 the prosecutor ordered police to arrest him after his seventh no-show. Nothing happened.Then, against a backdrop of growing political turmoil in Thailand, the case appeared to be forgotten.Public interest in it was revived only after a horrifying road accident last year, involving another wealthy young man who drove his luxury car at high speed into another vehicle, killing two graduate students.People started asking what had happened to the Red Bull heir. And a military government, which had promised to address the abuses of previous governments, felt forced to act. Or, perhaps more accurately, to be seen to be acting.In March last year the Attorney-General announced that he would once again press charges against Mr Vorayuth. But throughout last year, his lawyers successfully postponed repeated requests for him to report to the prosecutor's office, claiming that their client had filed a complaint of unfair treatment to the National Legislative Assembly, the military-appointed parliament. Lawyers spoken to by the BBC say there is no legal justification for using this device to delay proceedings against Mr Vorayuth, but that is what is happening.Today the police insist they can do nothing.Asked why they have not issued an arrest warrant against the accused, as requested three and a half years ago, they told the BBC that it is up to the Attorney-General's office to act. The Attorney-General's office says he cannot be indicted unless he appears in person.And for the latest request for him to report to the prosecutor's office to hear those charges? Mr Vorayuth, we are now told by his lawyers, is on business in the UK. The Attorney-General has once again granted a postponement, to next month.The relatives of Sergeant-Major Wichian have said little about the case. As usually happens in these situations, the Yoovidhya family have paid them a large sum of money, around $100,000. In return they have agreed not to press charges themselves. And public interest in Thailand will probably wane, as people wearily conclude that, once again, the rich have shown that they are beyond the reach of the law, in a country ridden with corruption and abuses of power.One lawyer, who was once closely connected to the case, told the BBC he had never seen another example of a suspect evading justice like this one. Had it been someone else, without a powerful family behind him, he said, he would certainly have been arrested the first time he failed to report himself.The most serious charge against Mr Vorayuth, of reckless driving causing death, expires in the year 2027. Few people are betting that he will face any legal sanction, or indeed any meaningful restrictions on his lifestyle before that deadline frees him completely from any lingering repercussions of the events of that morning four and a half years ago.Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning"

678,'Exploding dumplings': When Asian food is done wrong,"You may have seen the recent outrage over Time Out London's seemingly innocent video about ""exploding dumplings"". The travel and lifestyle organisation was criticised by foodies for ""manhandling"" traditional soup dumplings, known as Xiao Long Bao, literally, little basket buns. In the one-minute video, diners were shown bursting their baos with chopsticks and, much to my horror, throwing away the soup. Any Xiao Long Bao enthusiast knows you are meant to eat them in one go, even at the risk of scalding your mouth from the broth.Time Out London said its intention was just to show viewers ""the visual treat of the broth that is tasted but not seen"". It even extended an olive branch with a public blog post asking food lovers of Asia for culinary advice. 'Exploding' soup dumpling video angers Asian foodiesAsia is a continent of fierce food lovers, and this is not the first time a foreign misunderstanding of our culinary heritage has caused uproar.Here are some more examples of when beloved dishes went wrong. Mention Pinoy cuisine and you'll think of Halo-halo, a colourful dessert of shaved ice and evaporated milk with boiled sweet beans, coconut, sago, jelly, tubers and fruits added to the mix. What could be more Filipino? Thanks (or no thanks) to a group of US chefs, the legendary delicacy soon reached America's most famous music and arts festival: Coachella.Much to the dismay of Filipino foodies everywhere, the Coachella version was gluten-free and vegan. It was given a hipster twist, with fruity pebbles cereal, soft tofu and gasp, Red Bull added to it. ""The 'Halo-halo' they had at Coachella makes me sad because that's not Halo-halo,"" cried one Twitter user. ""In other news, Coachella just bastardised Halo-halo by serving it drenched in Red Bull instead of milk,"" lamented another. Are you ready pho this, Vietnamese aficionados? Los Angeles restaurant Komodo paid tribute last year to Vietnam's national dish by merging slices of beef, vermicelli rice noodles, bean sprouts, herbs and hoisin sauce into a burrito it dubbed a Phoritto. For an extra spicy kick, it also added jalapeños. The creation shot to popularity thanks to an Insider food video, generating more than 157,000 Facebook reactions and 335,000 shares. The dish was not as controversial as Coachella Halo-halo and exploding Xiao Long Baos. It actually got rave reviews. ""The ingredients of a bowl of pho wrapped in a tortilla, without the broth. The perfect fusion of Vietnamese and Mexican cuisine,"" wrote Binhtri Vu in a Facebook review. ""I've had pho before, ate it in different parts of Vietnam so I can honestly say that I have plenty of experience."" But one simply does not mess with Vietnam's national dish. Not according to rants on social media. ""No-one can convince me that the phoritto is a good idea,"" said Huong Nguyen on Twitter. ""They've gone too far. It's not pho if there's no broth, that's the best part. Don't murder a staple of our country for your own selfish commercial gain,"" said another outraged foodie on Facebook. Komodo, by the way, is in neither Mexico nor Vietnam, but an island in Indonesia.Are you listening, Tyler Akin? The owner of a Philadelphia-based pho restaurant incurred the wrath of a nation of pho lovers by telling them how to ""get the most out of"" their national dish. The video titled, ""How to Eat Pho"" racked up over 1.2m views with even more negative comments from angry Asians who grew up eating the delicacy.""When people come in and immediately squirt Hoisin Sriracha sauce, it completely destroys the decisions we make about the soup. I do not put sauce in my soup,"" the US chef said in a running commentary that was rebutted by many diners, who pointed out that they enjoyed hot sauce, particularly with their beef slices. ""Hey Vietnamese people, guess what? We have been eating our pho the wrong way,"" said Facebook user Klot Kleng Dong. ""This is coming from a white boy trying to culturally appropriate our comfort food. First of all, adding Thai basil is a preference and so is the Sriracha and hoisin sauce."" It's Hell's Kitchen, turned around. Back in 2009, British celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay got torn apart by a renowned Thai chef on an episode of his popular television series The F-Word for serving up less than perfect Pad Thai. ""This is not Pad Thai at all,"" Chef Chang admonished. ""Pad Thai has to be sweet, sour and salty."" Ramsay did try to save himself, saying that his dish tasted ""pretty good"". But Chang wasn't having any of it. ""For you maybe, but not for me.""The episode was hilarious, particularly because it showcased the difference in culinary standards between Westerners and native Asians. ""Did Ramsay just get Ramsayed,"" asked one amused YouTube user. ﻿""Roses are red, Violets are blue. Even if you are Ramsey, there's an Asian better than you,"" said another. ﻿﻿For an accurate verdict, I consulted my colleague Thanyarat Doksone in Bangkok. ""Of course everyone wants to try everything Ramsay cooks. But I'd personally rather go for a Pad Thai joint on the streets of Bangkok to get a more authentic taste."""
679,New population of rare tigers found in eastern Thailand,"A new breeding population of the critically endangered Indochinese tiger has been found in a national park in eastern Thailand, conservationists say.Camera traps discovered a small population with at least six cubs in the jungle.Poaching and the loss of habitat has reduced the global population of the sub-species to under 250.Conservationists said the success was due to the stepping-up of anti-poaching efforts in Thailand.Counter-trafficking organisation Freeland and Panthera, the wild cat conservation group, conducted the survey with the support of the Thai park authorities.Until this find, only one other breeding population of Indochinese tigers - also in a Thai national park - was known of.World tiger numbers show increaseHunting Thailand's farm tiger traffickers""The extraordinary rebound of eastern Thailand's tigers is nothing short of miraculous,"" said John Goodrich, tiger programme director at Panthera. The director of Thailand's national parks, Songtam Suksawang, said: ""The stepping up of anti-poaching patrols and law enforcement efforts in this area have played a pivotal role in conserving the tiger population by ensuring a safe environment for them to breed. ""However, we must remain vigilant and continue these efforts, because well-armed poachers still pose a major threat.""Numbers of tigers in the wild have dwindled from 100,000 a century ago to 3,900 today, the groups said in a joint statement.Thailand was the first country in this region to deplete its forests, to such an extent that by the 1980s it had banned logging. It was also among the first to establish national parks, but initially these were also badly stressed by illegal logging and hunting.At the time, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and even Vietnam had a lot of pristine forests left, with healthy populations of tigers. Tigers had declined in Thailand to the point where in the early 2000s it was thought they were very small and fragmented.But since then, massive illegal exploitation has badly depleted the forests and tiger populations in the other countries - even Myanmar - to the point where Indochinese tigers are believed to be extinct in Cambodia, down to just a handful in Laos and Vietnam and with unknown, but almost certainly greatly reduced numbers in eastern Myanmar. Meanwhile,  improved conservation strategies have allowed the tiny population of Indochinese tigers in Thailand to recover in some areas, although they have disappeared in others. So, with its reasonably well-run national parks, Thailand finds itself unexpectedly the last stronghold of the Indochinese tiger."

Neil was jailed in Thailand between August 2008 and September 2012 following a conviction for sexual offences against two boys.  He was released and deported to Canada. In December 2015 he pleaded guilty to five new charges involving the sexual abuse of young boys in Cambodia and possession of child pornography in Canada.  His sentenced was reduced due to time already served. Neil, originally from Maple Ridge, BC, had spent about 15 years in Asia teaching English. "

685,The curious case of a hidden abbot and a besieged temple,"Over the past month what is often cited as the world's largest Buddhist temple, on the outskirts of Bangkok, has been the scene of an extraordinary stalemate. Police officers, in rows three deep, blocked the gates to the Wat Dhammakaya temple compound. Around the back, helmeted soldiers guarded alleyways, with some crawling through surrounding rice-fields. It was, they explained, a restricted military zone. Nobody was allowed inside. The official reason for this siege was that the elderly abbot, Phra Dhammachayo, was wanted on multiple criminal charges related to a collapsed credit union and police believed he was being hidden inside the temple. It was the largest security operation since the 2014 coup, involving thousands of troops and police officers, trying to flush him out. At one point it seemed certain they would storm the temple. Conservative supporters of the government made no secret of their wish to see what they view as a dangerously deviant Buddhist sect shut down.But then, after three weeks,  the operation was suddenly called off. The police, after their third search through the sprawling complex, appeared to have been convinced that the abbot was no longer there. So the temple's passionate followers, who had been confined by the police in a nearby marketplace, were finally allowed to enter. Even now it remains unclear what exactly the police wanted to achieve.As so often in Thailand, the official explanation is misleading. Allegations of financial malpractice have hung over the temple and its charismatic abbot for decades. They also hang over many other institutions and individuals in Thailand, many of whom are neither investigated nor prosecuted. To be pursued by the state with this much commitment suggests that much larger issues are at stake.Wat Dhammakaya is controversial. The temple compound has been constructed on a vast scale, with a huge, open-air auditorium, centred on a gold, flying-saucer-shaped chedi (stupa). Other futuristic buildings are dotted around the site - it is quite unlike any other Buddhist temple. It does not hide the fact that it is perhaps the wealthiest religious sect in Thailand. The auditorium can, we were told, accommodate up to one million people, and Dhammakaya is famous for its impressively choreographed mass-meditations, sometimes by candlelight. The movement is big on discipline. Its stripped-down interpretation of traditional Buddhist thinking and practices, and the intense, shared experience of meditation, has proven very appealing to its urban, middle-class followers, whose intense devotion to Phra Dhammachayo has been likened by some to a form of cult worship. The emphasis on donations has prompted accusations that it has commercialised Buddhism.So it should come as no surprise that a military government bent on restoring traditional values, and backed by ultra-conservatives who want to see the Buddhist clergy cleansed of corrupting, modern influences, dislikes Wat Dhammakaya. A former senator, Paiboon Nititawan, who has led the calls for the temple to be taken over, goes further and argues that it is a threat to national security.""Phra Dhammachayo is ready to ask his followers to protect him, and those tens of thousands of people could easily turn into a mob. The abbot's followers insisted the police needed their permission to enter, and that they would only comply with their orders when Thailand is democratic again. This is like declaring autonomy, and denying the sovereignty of the state.""Temple followers laugh off these accusations as absurd. Spokeperson Phra Pasura Dantamano, a former Thai Airways flight attendant who became a monk at Dhammakaya 11 years ago, said that even if the security forces stormed the temple, they would face only peaceful resistance.""We are just a temple, we are not a threat to national security. As you can see, we are women and old people, chanting and meditating. We are not dangerous.""But the government continues to push its argument that there is something sinister about Wat Dhammakaya. Last weekend the police showed off a large cache of weapons seized, they said, from the home of a now-exiled dissident. Although many of the weapons were ancient, the police argued that there was a plan to arm the temple's supporters and even to assassinate top government officials.The attempt to link the temple with this dissident is telling. His name is Wuthipong ""Kotee"" Kochathamakun, one of the most outspoken members of the ""red-shirt"" movement, which backed the government unseated by the coup. He left Thailand even before the coup and has been charged in absentia with lese majeste, insulting the monarchy. He was singled out by the military in 2014 as a dangerous radical, although other red-shirt activists say his tough talk was largely posturing. But the police statements help reinforce the government's view that Wat Dhammakaya is allied to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, whose parties won every election held over the past 20 years and whose destruction as a political force is still thought to be the primary, though unstated, aim of the 2014 coup leaders.Again the temple denies this charge, insisting it is above politics and pointing out that its followers come from all political factions.More do appear to come from the red-shirt side; a number of prominent red politicians attend the meditation sessions. But academic James Taylor from Adelaide University, who has studied Wat Dhammakaya for years, believes the notion of a political alliance is now outdated.""The movement was clearly ambitious during its early decades, contesting religious convention by attempting to reframe the religious system from within, recruiting economically and politically influential individuals... But in the past decade it has remained outside of politics in an effort to disassociate itself from any political alliances.""There are striking parallels between the methods used by Wat Dhammakaya and Mr Thaksin's political movement to build a mass support base. Both offered a powerful sense of belonging to people feeling rootless in Thailand's increasingly urban and material society. Both were skilled at using modern media to project a simple, appealing philosophy and skilled at raising large amounts of money, an essential ingredient for any successful movement in Thailand.Indeed the temple is the largest institution in the country not under the military's control, and its refusal to hand over its abbot is the most sustained defiance of military rule since the coup.But there is another equally important factor which may have driven the government to act. Buddhism itself has been in crisis in Thailand for many years, as the modern, material world has either corrupted parts of the monkhood, or made its role seem less relevant, much as the church has lost its influence in Western societies. The popularity of Wat Dhammakaya is a symptom of that lost faith in traditional religion. And this matters in a country lacking the reinforcing narrative of an anti-colonial struggle that has defined the identity of so many other countries in this region. Thailand's official national slogan has long been ""Nation, Religion, King"", although the military government has now added ""People"" to the slogan, and an ""s"" to ""Religion"" to acknowledge that not every Thai is Buddhist.Just as the monarchy is seen by Thailand's rulers as the essential institution holding the country together and legitimising governments, so the monarch's official role as protector of Buddhism gives each occupant of the throne a unique, sacred stature. Kings preside over the most important Buddhist rituals at the most prestigious temples. The two institutions reinforce each other. And that symbiotic relationship is never more important than in a time of transition, as now, after the defining, 70 year-long reign of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, and while his untested son, King Maha Vajiralongkorn, is shaping his own, very different reign, one which the harsh penalties of the lese majeste law prevent any Thailand-based journalist from writing about it freely.Presiding over his father's elaborate cremation later this year will be an important source of legitimacy for the new king. But his relationship with the Buddhist hierarchy also matters. Already he has made his mark, restoring the monarch's right to name the Supreme Patriarch, the head of the Sangha, the body that regulates the faith, but which has lain moribund for some years.King Vajirakongkorn's command to strip the royal monastic titles from Phra Dhammachayo and his de facto replacement as abbot also signals royal support for the government's move against the temple.Thailand is in the midst of a complex and potentially dangerous, triple transition; a delicate royal succession, a battle over the future of Buddhism and a still uncertain political transition to a military-guided democracy. Given that, a sect as controversial as Wat Dhammakaya was perhaps bound to be caught up in the turbulence.  "

687,Thailand coin-eating sea turtle 'Piggy Bank' dies,"A turtle in Thailand that had an operation to remove nearly 1,000 coins from her stomach two weeks ago has died from blood poisoning.The 25-year-old sea turtle fell into a coma after a second operation on Sunday, following intestinal problems.Named Omsin, meaning ""Piggy Bank"", she was found to be eating coins thrown into a public pond where she lived, in Chonburi province.By the time they were removed, she was carrying 5kg (11lb) of coins.The unusual mass of metal had cracked her shell, making the initial seven-hour operation necessary.She was said to have been doing well after that surgery but developed blood poisoning at the weekend, which doctors said was the cause of death.The coins were thrown into the pond by visitors hoping for good luck - a practice some hope will become less common after widespread coverage of the case in Thailand.Omsin's demise prompted sadness and soul-searching.Many took issue with ""merit making"" practices common in Thailand, that sometimes harm animal welfare.  Hopes had been high for Omsin's recovery.Even after she slipped into a coma, the surgeon leading the team trying to save her said they wouldn't give up.Doctors said the removal of the coins had created a space in Omsin's stomach that had probably blocked blood flow in her intestine. That became fatal after she suffered an acute intestinal infection."
688,'Insulting' Thai palace soap opera angers Myanmar,"A Thai soap opera that appears to depict Burmese palace intrigue has angered some in Myanmar including a descendant of Myanmar's last king.Soe Win, the great-grandson of King Thibaw, has called for the show to be cancelled as it is ""insulting"". But producers of the historical drama, called A Lady's Flames, have insisted it is purely fictional.Thailand strictly regulates depictions and reporting on its own monarchy under its lese majeste laws.""We have asked Thais this, would they accept it if one of our companies here did the same thing about their country,"" Soe Win told news agency AFP.A Lady's Flames, also known as Plerng Phra Nang in Thai, depicts the bloody court politics of a 19th Century South East Asian kingdom that appears to closely resemble Myanmar, also known as Burma.The lady in question is Ananthip, a character who schemes to seize control of the kingdom.Some have observed she closely resembles Hsinbyumashin, a real-life Burmese palace consort who orchestrated the massacre of scores of royals so that Thibaw could ascend the throne.Thibaw abdicated and the Burmese monarchy was abolished in 1885, when British forces defeated and invaded Burma.Some Burmese online have also observed the show's costumes and setting are strikingly similar to that of the Burmese court. One Facebook user called Cho Lay posted a series of pictures of characters from the show, complaining that it was ""defamation of Myanmar Royals"".In statements to the media Soe Win said the drama was ""distasteful"" and that scenes showing royal family members slapping each other was ""quite insulting, as if we are wild"".He called on Thailand to cancel the drama ""to develop our... relations as good neighbours.""A Lady's Flames is a remake of a 1996 drama that was based on historical books about Myanmar, according to Thai news portal Khaosod.But a producer of the show, which airs on Thailand's Channel 7, told Khaosod that it was ""unrelated to Burma and is completely fictional, with the costumes and setting not meant to evoke any country or time period in particular"".Thailand and Myanmar have had centuries of animosity, having fought several wars against each other. Burmese characters often appear in Thai historical dramas, and are usually depicted as cunning or as villains."

691,Thai beach murders: Convicted men lose death sentence appeal,"Two men convicted of murdering British tourists Hannah Witheridge and David Miller in Thailand have lost their appeal against the death sentence.The bodies of backpackers Miss Witheridge, 23, from Norfolk, and Mr Miller, 24, from Jersey, were found on a beach on Koh Tao in September 2014.Burmese bar workers Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Tun were found guilty of the killings in December 2015.An appeal court in Thailand upheld the death sentences handed down to them.Lawyers for the two men now have 30 days to appeal to the Supreme Court - Thailand's final court of appeal.The pair's mothers lodged appeals at Koh Samui court last May over concerns about the judgements, in particular the DNA evidence used in the investigation.""We don't believe the court can say beyond reasonable doubt that Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were responsible for the events which took place in September 2014,"" said Andy Hall, one of the families' legal advisors.Miss Witheridge, a University of Essex student from Hemsby, and Mr Miller, a civil and structural engineering graduate, were found on a beach having been bludgeoned to death.A post-mortem examination showed Miss Witheridge had been raped.Prosecutors said DNA evidence collected from cigarette butts, a condom and the bodies of the victims linked Lin and Phyo to the deaths.The men, from Myanmar, retracted their initial confessions to the offences, saying they had been tortured by police.Their lawyers argued DNA from a garden hoe - allegedly used as the murder weapon - did not match samples taken from the men.They also claimed evidence had been mishandled by police and the pair's confessions were the result of ""systematic abuse"" of migrants in the area."

693,Thailand's Phuket relaxes ban on beach sun loungers,"Sun loungers are returning to at least one public beach at the popular Thai resort of Phuket, after a three-year ban on them by the army, the Phuket Gazette website reports.The loungers were first outlawed in 2014, as part of an effort to better regulate the vendors renting them and other beach paraphernalia, and to reduce the amount of clutter on the seafront. Local authorities had even raided beaches and seized loungers and chairs to enforce the ban. Thailand has been ruled by a military government since May 2014.However, rules have relaxed over the three years since the ban was put in place, and vendors have been able to rent out mats or umbrellas in restricted areas on beaches, and tourists can bring their own to use. But sun loungers have remained off-limits until now. Even wily attempts by some vendors to build sand beds shaped like loungers were barred this Christmas, the Bangkok Post says. Phuket's mayor, Chalermluck Kebsup, said the decision had been been reversed on Patong, Phuket's most popular beach. It remains to be seen whether the island's other stretches of sand will also benefit from the more laid-back rules, the Phuket News website says.

696,Phra Dhammajayo search: Thai monks clash with police,
697,Thai police fail to find monk in Dhammakaya temple raid,"Thai police have failed to find an influential Buddhist leader, wanted for alleged money-laundering, after searching his sect's vast headquarters.Police said they found medical equipment in rooms where they had expected to find the group's former abbot, 72-year-old Phra Dhammajayo.They say they will keep searching the Dhammakaya temple complex, under a 10-day search warrant.Officers first entered the site, near Bangkok, on Thursday.Previous attempts to search the complex were thwarted when thousands of the monk's devotees turned up in his defence.The latest search is being carried out under an emergency law, after the temple for months failed to hand over Phra Dhammajayo, saying he was too ill to be questioned.Phra Dhammajayo, who founded the temple, is wanted on money laundering charges and accusations of receiving stolen goods. But when officers attempted to search the site last June they were blocked by his supporters.The abbot appears not to have left the temple for months and has long denied the allegations, saying they are politically motivated.Founded in the 1970s, it contrasts starkly with the informal, tradition-bound character of most Thai temples. It more closely resembles charismatic cult, with tightly choreographed mass meditations at its flying saucer-like chedi.It is controversial partly due to its size, its followers intense devotion and its unusual interpretation of Buddhist practice.It has become wealthy on the back of generous donations, and critics accuse it of distorting Buddhism at the expense of local temples. They also allege links to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.Temple followers deny ties but the potential for huge numbers of them to be mobilised in protests may weigh on the minds of the military government.Thousands of police and soldiers surrounded the site before dawn on Thursday, blocking the roads leading to and from the temple and putting the area under military control.""We are sealing off the temple and after that we will search all the buildings,"" said Col Paisit Wongmaung, head of the Department of Special Investigations (DSI).""If [the abbot] thinks he is innocent he should surrender and enter [a] judicial process,"" he said.A spokesman for the temple said he did not know if Phra Dhammajayo was inside. ""I don't know his whereabouts - I haven't seen him in about nine months,"" AFP quoted spokesman Phra Sanitwong Wutthiwangso as saying."
698,Thai police raid Dhammakaya temple in hunt for wanted monk,"Thai police have begun searching a Buddhist temple complex in a bid to arrest an influential monk wanted over alleged money laundering.Officers entered the site after previous attempts were thwarted when thousands of the monk's devotees turned up in his defence.The spiritual leader is believed to be inside the large compound.Police said they did not find him on Thursday but would return on Friday to continue looking. A Thai police spokesman said officers covered 15-20% of the complex. The search warrant was valid for 10 days, he said. The Dhammakaya temple is a sprawling compound on the outskirts of Bangkok. Its founder, Phra Dhammajayo, is accused of embezzling funds from the temple, but when officers attempted to search the site last June they were blocked by his supporters.The 72-year-old abbot has remained inside the temple for months, saying he is too ill to face officials. He denies the allegations and says they are politically motivated.Thousands of police and soldiers surrounded the site before dawn on Thursday, blocking the roads leading to and from the temple and putting the area under military control.""We are sealing off the temple and after that we will search all the buildings,"" said Col Paisit Wongmaung, head of the Department of Special Investigations (DSI).""If [the abbot] thinks he is innocent he should surrender and enter [a] judicial process,"" he said.A spokesman for the temple said he did not know if Phra Dhammajayo was inside. ""I don't know his whereabouts - I haven't seen him in about nine months,"" AFP quoted spokesman Phra Sanitwong Wutthiwangso as saying.There have been several failed attempts to persuade the former abbot to leave the temple, which is home to a charismatic Buddhist sect. It has more than a million followers but has been criticised for commercialising Buddhism.There is also speculation that the temple has links to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Both his government and one led by his sister were ousted by military coups in 2006 and 2014. The temple, however, says it has no political affiliation and says it attracts Thais from all walks of life and political persuasions.The military has been running Thailand since the coup in 2014."

Trash Dove, a Facebook sticker which has bowled over social media in Asia, is the cartoon baby of American artist Syd Weiler.The Florida-based illustrator drew the bird in September 2016 and subsequently created a set of Facebook stickers in January 2017.Trash Dove appeared in various guises that people could use as emojis, the most popular one showing the bird vigorously thrashing its head up and down.  It was all ticking along quietly and then wham - or coo coo - the dove appeared on a popular Thai Facebook page in a dance-off with a cartoon cat in early February.Within a week, it had racked up 4 million views, and an army of fans.After its popularity was picked up by news channels in Thailand, Weiler posted a thank you video on her Facebook page:  ""Hello Thailand, thank you all so so much for your support. I'm really glad that you like the stickers.""However, not everyone is a fan. There is a petition to ban the bird from the internet by those fed up with seeing its purple bobbing head. But what does it actually mean? Well, who knows? Perhaps its ambiguity is one of the reasons it is so popular.As Syd Weiler wrote on her Facebook page in October 2016 : ""In case you didn't know, I made some fantastically dumb iOS stickers, you can spam your friends and family with them!""It's just another in a long list of internet memes we've seen so far this year like salt bae and cash me ousside.'And if you haven't spotted Trash Dove yet, fear not.

707,Prolific paedophile Mark Frost admits to abuse in UK and Asia,"A prolific paedophile faces years in jail after admitting to 45 sex offences against children in the UK and abroad.Retired English teacher Mark Frost, 70, admitted abusing nine children in Thailand between 2009 and 2012.He pleaded guilty to 23 charges at the Old Bailey after admitting 22 charges last year. Six of the charges relate to abuse of two pupils at a Worcestershire school during the 1980s and 1990s. Frost is due to be sentenced on Thursday.Previously known as Andrew Tracey, Frost was brought to justice following an international investigation involving the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA), and authorities in Thailand, Spain and the Netherlands.Frost raped impoverished Asian boys and encouraged them to engage in sex acts after he groomed them with money, sweets, computer games and swims in his pool.He skipped bail to avoid prosecution in Thailand but was extradited from Spain last year after his activities were uncovered by Dutch police on the computer of a man in the Netherlands.Frost had got the boys, aged between 10 and 14, to give thumbs-up signs and make heart gestures with their hands while being filmed on a webcam engaging in sexual acts.The court also heard details of Frost's abuse of two pupils at a school in Worcestershire during the late 1980s and 1990s. He had sex with the boys in a school storeroom, during breaks, at his home where he lived with his adopted son, and also at a car park in Woking, Surrey, the Old Bailey heard.One of those victims has died since coming forward, while the other said in a statement he had ""lived in fear"" every day following the abuse. Frost admitted to charges that included multiple rapes, sex assaults, inciting children to engage in sexual activity and making indecent pictures. Prosecutor Sally-Ann Hales said images and web chats seized from Frost's Dutch contact featured 15 boys, nine of whom were identified and interviewed.The boys' mothers expressed their ""sorrow"" at finding out the man they regarded as a ""kind and generous foreigner"" had abused their children.One of the youngsters was ""too ashamed"" to tell his mother and had gone from being a ""bubbly, happy boy"" to being ""withdrawn and sometimes aggressive"", the court heard.The court heard Frost had subscribed to the now-defunct Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), an international organisation of people who traded obscene material.In 1986 he tried to adopt a son through the Catholic Church and was turned down, only to succeed through a local authority. The pair are now estranged.Having joined the Scouts in 1967, he reached a senior position but resigned in 1991 before his first conviction.He was banned from teaching by the Department for Education in 1995.The NCA believes he may have assaulted many more youngsters he had contact with through his 25-year career in schools and as a senior Scouts volunteer.It has appealed for any more victims to come forward who may have gone to schools where Frost taught in east London, Worcestershire and Hertfordshire."
708,Thai official resigns after stealing paintings in Japan,"A Thai official has resigned after he was caught stealing paintings from a hotel in Japan. Suphat Saquandeekul, who was deputy director of the office of intellectual property, was identified on security cameras lifting three paintings off the corridor walls of the Kyoto hotel.The paintings, worth around $125 (£100), were later found in his bags. In an apology released to the media, Mr Suphat said that he was drunk when he attempted the theft.The 60-year-old, who was working for a body tasked with trying to roll back Thailand's reputation as a counterfeit hub, had been in the popular tourist city after attending meetings in Osaka.""After I finished my mission in Japan I met with some university friends. We were drunk and I unconsciously and unintentionally committed an inappropriate act,"" he wrote in the letter.Is Thailand's battle against corruption working?It did not take long for the hotel to notice the missing pictures, and Mr Suphat quickly found himself under arrest - sending Thai diplomats scrambling to secure his release.He was freed after he admitted his guilt and paid the hotel compensation.But his hopes of retaining a job on his return were short-lived, and the resignation comes a week after the scandal broke - ending his 33-year career with the service."
709,Growth in Spanish bars boosts Diageo sales,"The dominant distiller of Scotch whisky has reported a return to growth, in both volume and sales value.The improvement for Diageo is partly driven by growth in Spanish bars and clubs.This previously saw a sharp fall in sales with the country's economic downturn.Germany and Austria also saw a strong growth in demand for Scotch, but sales are weaker in Asia, particularly Korea, Thailand and airport duty-free shops.The London-headquartered drinks firm reported a 4% growth in Scotch whisky sales by volume, and a 6% growth in the comparable value of those sales.Its figures looked much better through the impact of the weakened British pound. That meant there was a 20% rise in the reported value of sales.Because foreign sales for the world's biggest distiller of spirits are converted back into sterling, it saw total sales for the second half of 2016 rise by 15% to £6.4bn, and operating profit was up by 28% to top £2bn. The total volume of production fell by 1%.Diageo represents about 40% of Scotch whisky production, and Scotch represents 27% of all the drinks the company sells. Its reported half-year growth was strongest for two of its main brands - Johnnie Walker and Buchanan's. Its other brands include Bells, Talisker and Dalwhinnie.In the important US market, Johnnie Walker benefited from stronger promotion, with sales up 8%.  In both Nigeria and Mexico, there was 22% growth for Johnnie Walker sales.Chinese demand for Scotch whisky had stalled, with official disapproval of the extravagant corporate gift and hospitality culture. But the latest figures for July to December show it back to 5% growth.Korea had also been a country seeing strong growth in demand, but the Windsor brand has fallen sharply as demand grows for a rival, lower-alcohol, locally-produced drink.Other Diageo products to do well in the second half of last year were US and Canadian whiskey. There was sharp growth, from a low base, in its tequila sales. Vodka revenue fell 2% worldwide, and was only growing in Africa.In Britain, Diageo's sales were flat. The strongest brand was Tanqueray, up by 42%, reflecting the growth in premium gins, and Diageo's efforts to improve its distribution. Bailey's Irish Cream rose 2%, helped by Christmas promotions. Guinness, the leading beer produced by Diageo, saw flat sales.Ivan Menezes, chief executive of Diageo, said: ""Highlights this half include improved performance in our US spirits business and across our Scotch portfolio, driven by our focus on marketing with impact, innovating at scale and expanding our route to consumer.""Progress on productivity supports growth, margin improvement and consistent strong cash-flow generation, as well as improving our agility.""In Scotland, Diageo runs 29 distilleries and two bottling plants at Leven in Fife and Shieldhall, Glasgow."
710,Briton shot dead in Porsche in Thailand's Pattaya resort,"A British man has been shot dead in his Porsche in Thailand.Tony Kenway, originally from Southampton, was killed in a car park in the resort of Pattaya at 14:10 local time, according to the Bangkok Post.The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has confirmed it is in contact with local police regarding the death of a British national.Sanit Sport Club, where the shooting happened, offered its condolences in a message posted on its Facebook page.It read: ""We are very sad to announce the death of Tony Kenway who lost his life this morning. We would like to offer Tony's family and friends our deepest sympathy and condolences at this difficult time. RIP Tony.""The Bangkok Post reported that an eyewitness described the gunman as a ""chubby man wearing a white T-shirt and black jacket"" who opened the door of the red Cayenne GTS before firing once and escaping on a black motorcycle.Mr Kenway was described as a father-of-four who had set up a website design business.His Facebook profile shows he lived in Bangkok but previously resided in Marbella, Spain, and had been married to his wife, Pans, since November.A FCO spokeswoman said: ""We are in contact with the family of a British man following his death in Pattaya, Thailand. Our sympathies are with them at this difficult time. We are in touch with the local police."" "
711,Life and death on Thailand's lethal roads,"There is a ritual that is now very familiar to Thais, before the two big holiday seasons of the year, in late December for the new year, and in April for the Songkran Festival. The government will set a target for reducing fatalities on Thailand's notoriously dangerous roads, exhorting Thais not to speed, or drink and drive. Sometimes good citizens will run publicity stunts, like the coffin-maker, who last year invited journalists to film the huge stockpile his workers were building up for the holiday season. And every year these efforts fail. The grim statistics of death and injury on the roads are tallied each day in the media with, as often as not, worse figures than the year before.And so it was this last new year - 478 people lost their lives on the roads in just seven days. In one horrific collision in Chonburi on 2 January, 25 people died - some burned to death in a crushed and overcrowded passenger van they could not escape.Thailand's roads are currently ranked the second most lethal in the world after Libya's by the World Health Organization. This status is all the more extraordinary given the fact that Thailand has been peaceful and increasingly prosperous for decades, with governments that in other fields, like healthcare and infrastructure, have made impressive progress.In 2011 the then-government announced the following ten years as Thailand's 'Decade of Action on Road Safety'. It declared 2012 as the year of 100 percent helmet use on motorbikes. In 2015 the Department of Disaster Prevention, which is tasked with road safety in addition to problems like floods and landslides, boldly announced a target of reducing road deaths by 80%. All in vain.The challenge they face is not hard to see. Thailand's rapid development has bequeathed it an unrivalled network of 462,133 roads in the region, nearly all paved, with plenty of multi-lane highways. There are 37 million registered vehicles, 20 million of them motorbikes, and millions more that are unregistered. Driving on a Thai expressway is akin to playing a hyper-caffeinated video game. A cursory web search for road accident videos will throw up examples of breathtaking, sometimes suicidal, recklessness. Drunk driving is a huge problem.In 2014 and 2015 three foreigners, a British couple and a Chilean man, who were cycling around the world, and near the end of their journeys, were killed while travelling through Thailand. A pick-up truck driver, who struck the British couple while trying to reach a hat on the floor of his cab, was fined the equivalent of $30 and given a suspended prison sentence.""Thailand has beautiful roads"", explains Ratana Winther, the country director for the US-based Asia Injury Prevention Foundation. ""And people tend to go very fast. So the number one killer is speed.""Police Sergeant-Major Kanthachat Nua-on can attest to that. At a speed trap he had set up on a stretch of elevated expressway outside Bangkok, he watched car after car pass him at speeds well in excess of the 80km/h (50 mph) limit. He did not bother to ticket them. ""If we strictly follow what the law says, and issue a ticket for people driving over the speed limit, then we will end up booking everyone."" He booked just one car, travelling at 129km/h. But the fines are small, and more than half of those ticketed do not bother to pay, with little follow-up. In recent years there have been a number of cases where drivers from wealthy families have killed, and been treated with extraordinary leniency. In 2012 the grandson of the man who made a fortune from the Red Bull energy drink killed a policeman while driving at speed in his Ferrari. He was charged, but has repeatedly failed to show up in court. Another case was that of a 16-year-old girl from an influential family, driving without a license, who struck a passenger van, killing nine of its occupants. She was given a suspended prison sentence, and ordered to do community service - which it turned out two years later she had avoided doing. ""Enforcement is the key"", says Ratana Winther. ""But that is not just about telling the police to enforce the law. The police should be told to prioritise traffic policing over traffic management.""But it is a multi-sectoral challenge. The punishment needs to be big enough for people to be afraid of it. And the safety campaigns must be continuous, not just at peak seasons. Then we need to move on to issues like improving the engineering of roads.""Former Deputy Transport Minister and safety campaigner Nikorn Chamnong goes further. ""We need to go back and change the DNA of the country,"" he says. ""Education, right back in schools, is important"".He has been petitioning the current military-appointed National Assembly to do more. It is now on the point of approving ten changes to driving laws, including mandating the use of rear seatbelts - overall the largest overhaul of road safety legislation in 40 years. But no-one knows how well these laws will be enforced.Members of the public are cynical. ""There is a saying, that a true Thai follows his own rules,"" said Pongsak Putta, a motorbike taxi driver, who was hit by a car and injured over the new year.""As long as it does not happen to them, people do not think safety is an issue,"" said Pornpen Wongbantoon, who complains about the poor driving of the buses she has to take to work.""Enforcement is everything,"" says Dr Liviu Vedrasco, who works on road safety at the World Health Organization.The government officials he works with are serious about road safety, he believes, but co-ordination is a real challenge. The Road Safety Direction Centre is responsible for leading on the issue, but is subsumed within the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Department, which is itself within the Ministry of Interior. Roads are the responsibility of the Ministry of Transport.Dr Vedrasco believes the best way to cut the appalling death toll on the roads is to focus on the most vulnerable group, motorbikes, which account for 80% of deaths.""If you cannot reduce the number of motorbikes, the next best thing is separating them. Make a dedicated lane; maybe not a hundred percent of roads in Thailand, but aim to increase the percentage of roads with separated traffic - this will definitely have a tremendous impact.""After the shocking collision in Chonburi, the government has promised to phase out passenger vans, which it says are not designed to carry up to 15 people over long distances. The police believe the 64 year-old driver fell asleep at the wheel. He was on his fifth 300km, 3.5 hour journey in 33 hours.Twenty-six-year-old Hathaitip Modpai was one of the victims. She had been travelling in the van back from a new year visit to her parents to Bangkok, where she worked as a car saleswoman. She was an only child.After her funeral, her mother, Wimol, reflected on what the impact of her daughter's death would be.""I wish the government would do more,"" she said. ""After the accident people got excited for a while, but once the fuss dies down, everything will go back to the way it was before."""
712,Thailand road safety: Carnage on the roads,"About 24,000 people are killed every year on Thailand's roads, the BBC's Jonathan Head reports, yet few law-enforcement or road safety measures are in place to combat the problem."
713,Drenched Thailand still waiting for its green revolution,"Mr Supit bows low, palms together, fingers pointing to the wrathful heavens above.The north-east monsoon should have left the Thai island of Koh Samui more than a month ago, but the start of 2017 there has been greeted by a week of unremitting tropical storms.  Supposedly the high season, Mr Supit's hotel is dripping with umbrellas and soaking towels. The rains have prevented many staff from getting to work, made his international guests miserable and washed away his organic garden.  He breaks his wai - the traditional palms together gesture of greeting - throwing his arms apart with a shrug and a shake of his head. ""What more can I do?"" he asks.""We are going to cross the sea in front of us,"" he jokes as he attempts to drive down Main Street, floodwater sloshing up to the gunwales of his Ford.  ""This is very strange weather. We had similar storms five years ago, but that was in March. I have never known a new year like this.  We are thinking this must be the result of climate change.""Like the scooters abandoned beside the flooded roads, many of the resorts dotted around Samui's coast have spluttered to a stop.  A few plucky guests have filmed themselves laughing on lilos bobbing down the street, beers in hand, but Thai tourism is an industry that floats on sunshine and there has been virtually none of that for a week.    The local TV news is reporting that hundreds of families on the holiday island have been left homeless, bridges are down and many roads are impassable beneath brown, malodorous floodwater. Elsewhere in the province, the unexpected deluge has killed at least 18 people. A mile from his hotel, Mr Supit stops his car to look at a rockfall that has crashed across the ring road, red boulders brought down by the heavy rains. ""We need to be focusing on green again,"" he murmurs.Mr Supit recalls the environmental initiative launched with much fanfare by hoteliers and tour companies on Koh Samui in the late 90s after a landmark speech from the late king.  Thailand is still in mourning for King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died last October after 70 years on the throne. Black and white shrines to his memory are everywhere, reverence for the monarch akin to worship of a deity, his utterances regarded almost as sacred texts.In 1997, after massive currency speculation led to the total collapse of the Thai economy, mass unemployment and food shortages, King Bhumibol addressed the nation. He appealed for what he called a ""sufficiency economy"", a philosophy of moderation, balance and caution that, he argued, would help Thailand cope with the socio-economic, cultural and environmental challenges of globalisation.Some translated the speech as a decree to introduce a sustainable tourism policy - a change long overdue in a country that had witnessed almost unconstrained development for decades. Deforestation, the destruction of natural habitats and a brazen prostitution industry were among the ugly faces of the tourism goldrush.   Officials cautioned that without the kind of restraint implicit in the king's crisis speech, many of the unspoiled natural environments that attracted travellers would be destroyed. Thailand's famous white beaches would be lost to the sea, one minister warned.  Vibrant marine habitats and dense tropical jungles would be obliterated.A number of private hoteliers joined the Green Leaf Foundation, committing them to make their resorts carbon neutral. There are eco-friendly tour companies offering trips to the beautiful Angthong National Marine Park.  On Koh Samui, a government-backed initiative called Seven Greens was introduced, promoting sustainable practices and philosophy.  Recently, the Ministry of Tourism has urged holiday businesses to focus on attracting ""quality"" visitors - sophisticated and environmentally aware travellers who will value Thailand's natural and cultural treasures. The days of low-cost mass tourism are supposed to be numbered. But political rhetoric has not always matched reality. The tourist strips are still overflowing with sex bars, cheap beer and greasy burgers. Among Koh Samui's top attractions are monkey shows that animal welfare groups blame for wiping out half of Thailand's white-handed gibbon population. This is not a country that finds it easy to embrace the sacrifices of a green revolution: government figures suggest the average Thai uses an astonishing eight plastic bags a day. In the last two decades around 60 environmental activists have been killed in Thailand while campaigning against powerful logging companies and industrial polluters. Some question just how serious the military-backed government is in pursuing green policies.In his flooded organic garden, Mr Supit reflects on the 40 years since he landed his first tourist job as a pot washer in a Bangkok kitchen.  ""In the early days, people spent more money than now,"" he tells me as we assess the damage wreaked by the unwelcome storms.  In 1960, only 81,000 tourists visited Thailand, mostly high-rollers and adventurers from Europe and the Far East, people prepared to pay for something exotic. ""Today many more come, but they don't spend - particularly the Chinese,"" Mr Supit laments.A record 33 million tourists visited Thailand in 2016, more than eight million of them from China, pushing revenues up 18% in a single year. But Mr Supit is not alone in worrying that the country is overstretching itself.""I am very much concerned,"" he confides. ""We have to lift up the quality and we must focus on green again. At the moment I don't think my guests are prepared to pay more for that.""  His two-acre organic garden is an act of defiance: beds of traditional Thai basil and morning glory, lemongrass and lime trees are fed with homemade fertiliser, brewed on the plot from pineapple, molasses and water. When available, the Fairhouse Villa hotel chef makes full use of the fresh fruit, vegetables and spices. Sadly, his kitchen will not benefit for a while, with many of the garden's tender plants washed into the sea by the unseasonal storms.""It is tough work,"" Mr Supit says, surveying the damage. ""But we will keep planting.  We will get there."" He smiles and looks ruefully at the darkening sky.With the rains still falling, Thailand needs more people like Mr Supit.    "
714,Thailand floods: 12 dead as record rainfall persists,"At least 12 people have died and many villages been submerged after heavy rains caused severe flooding in southern Thailand.Hundreds of thousands of people have been affected with water levels reaching ""roof-high"" in some areas, Thailand's interior ministry said.Transport services, including flights, have been disrupted and rescue efforts are under way to reach those stranded.The heavy downpour is expected to continue for at least two more days.The flash floods have also damaged hundreds of schools and toppled power cables across southern Thailand.Residents in villages across the region are using inflatables, such as rubber rings, to cross submerged roads. Meanwhile, the airport in Nakhon Si Thammarat province has been forced to close after the area received a record 162mm (6.4 in) of rain on Friday, officials said.An official for Thailand's Meteorological Department told AFP news agency that the situation was ""very bad"", adding that it was still ""raining heavily"" in the south. In response to the crisis, the Thai navy has stationed its largest ship in the South to act as a floating command centre, dispatching aid using helicopters and small boats.Last month, aerial footage showed flood damage to parts of southern Thailand with only rooftops visible above the flood waters. Supplies were being delivered to residents by boat. Despite it being dry season between November and January in central and northern parts of Thailand, this time of year can see some of the heaviest rainfall in the southwest, where temperatures are more consistent throughout the year. In 2011, devastating floods in Thailand displaced thousands of people in more than a third of the country's provinces, resulting in more than 600 deaths."

720,Cambodia hunting suspects over doctored porn image of king,"Cambodian police plan to arrest three suspects who are accused of doctoring an image of the country's sovereign to place him in a gay porn scene, along with the words ""Cambodia King is gay"".The picture was posted on Facebook on Christmas Day, and seen in both Cambodia and Thailand. It is being viewed as a rare public insult against King Norodom Sihamoni.The monarch, who became king in 2004, is largely respected by the public and seen as being above politics. While the monarchy in neighbouring Thailand is protected by a lese majeste law that outlaws any criticism, there is no similar law in Cambodia. However, the country's constitution says the king is ""inviolable"" - or too significant to be treated with disrespect. Profile: What is Cambodia like?Cambodia's iconic former king diesA spokesman for Cambodia's interior ministry confirmed that an investigation had been launched.General Khieu Sopheak told the AFP news agency: ""We have got orders to arrest them. If we don't take action against them, more people might follow their act.""He refused to specify which law the three suspects might have broken, saying: ""The king represents the whole nation, and they are insulting the king, which is like they are insulting the whole nation.""Two of the suspects are believed to be in Cambodia, and the third in Thailand. Gen Sopheak said the authorities could seek help from Bangkok.Cambodia's kings once enjoyed a semi-divine status, but the role is mostly ceremonial nowadays.Observers say 63-year-old Sihamoni has ruled quietly as a constitutional monarch, fulfilling his duties while keeping out of the country's turbulent domestic politics.This is an arrangement that has suited the country's wily prime minister, Hun Sen, one of the world's longest serving heads of government.The king is an accomplished linguist who speaks English, French and Czech. Before becoming sovereign he spent much of his adult life abroad, pursuing a career in classical dance. He is unmarried, and has no children.When King Norodom Sihamoni inherited the throne from his father, Norodom Sihanouk, the BBC reported:""Few people had heard of Norodom Sihamoni before Cambodia's former king, Sihanouk, announced his abdication in early October.""But within days of the announcement, the 51-year-old ex-ballet dancer was thrust into the limelight as the most likely candidate to become the impoverished nation's next king.""The modest, music-loving bachelor was initially reluctant to take the throne, but said he was willing to do so if asked by Cambodia's official Throne Council.""Although he has represented his country as ambassador to the United Nations cultural organisation, Unesco, he has so far played no part in Cambodia's often chaotic politics.But his distance from political wrangling led him to be seen by both Sihanouk and Prime Minister Hun Sen as the most suitable candidate to succeed to the throne, a position which in recent years has become largely symbolic."""
721,Facebook Safety Check creates false alarm in Bangkok,"Facebook users in Bangkok were falsely alerted to an ""explosion"" in the Thai capital, after the social network activated its Safety Check feature.It allows Facebook users in danger zones to mark themselves as safe, but in this instance was triggered by a protester throwing firecrackers.Facebook said it relied on a ""trusted third party to confirm the incident"". But the way it was labelled misled many online as people started sharing false news of a blast.Facebook has recently faced criticism for allowing fake news to proliferate.How can Facebook fix its fake news problem?The person who writes fake news to be shared on FacebookOn Tuesday, a protester threw small firecrackers at a government building in Bangkok (link in Thai).According to Facebook, this triggered the Safety Check feature at about 21:00 local time which created a page titled ""The Explosion in Bangkok, Thailand"" and people started marking themselves as safe.The page also pulled in a link from a website called bangkokinformer.com referencing a BBC breaking news video about an explosion in Bangkok, but the video was in fact taken in 2015 in reference to a blast at the Erawan shrine. The safety check feature was later deactivated.The first I knew something was wrong was a stream of messages asking if I was ok, and spotting friends marking themselves as safe in Bangkok. By the time my colleagues had made efforts to get the erroneous post taken down, it had circulated widely, within minutes. It turned out Facebook was generating an automatic request to people to declare themselves safe, so even experienced journalists, who would have realised the story was not genuine, inadvertently gave it some credence by responding to the Facebook prompt.In a country so dependent on tourism any report of a suspected terrorist attack is a serious matter. The BBC and other reputable media take great care when reporting news of such incidents, stating only what we can already confirm. The latest false post spread quickly partly because people instantly saw the BBC's distinctive news logo, and assumed it was reliable before they checked the real date - 17 August 2015. This is a real problem for a journalist based in a country where we are under close scrutiny, and subject to criticism by government officials and Thai citizens for reporting in what is still a sensitive political climate. When Facebook first introduced the safety feature tool in 2014, it would activate the feature manually. In November, Facebook changed course and said it would now be activated ""by our community"".Now, a third-party source alerts Facebook when an incident occurs. The social platform then searches to see if users in the area are discussing the incident.If enough users are referencing the incident, those in the area are invited to mark themselves as safe.According to Facebook, the title of the safety check is taken from the alert provided by the third-party source."

The prince was widely expected to succeed his father, but officials had earlier said he wanted to postpone it by at least a year.The official reason given was that he wanted to give the Thai people time to mourn his father before he became king.Profile: Crown Prince Maha VajiralongkornWho holds power in Thailand?How King Bhumibol shaped modern ThailandViewpoint: Did Thai king help stifle democracy?Correspondents say Thailand was left in an odd constitutional limbo as the prince, the undisputed heir, should have succeeded his father immediately. In the past doubts have been expressed by senior officials over how the crown prince can perform the role played by his father for 70 years.The monarchy occupies a pivotal place in Thailand's political order. King Bhumibol Adulyadej had been seen as a unifying figure amid periods of political unrest, including during the most recent military coup in 2014.The leader of Thailand's parliament, the National Legislative Assembly, is expected to meet the crown prince in the next few days to formally invite him. Once the crown prince accepts, his succession would then be announced to the public.But it is still not clear when that will happen.Former Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda is currently standing in as regent.Thailand has rarely had what might be called routine royal successions. The last was 70 years ago, when the young King Ananda was found shot dead in his bedroom in still unexplained circumstances. When he died, an emergency session of parliament that night named his grief-stricken brother Bhumibol king.Despite private speculation over the prospects of his popular sister Princess Sirindhorn, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn has been the undisputed heir to the throne since his formal investiture in 1972.Thai succession law follows the principle of primogeniture, where the throne should pass to the eldest son of the reigning king, but it also gives the king the discretion to name his own choice. King Bhumibol never wavered in his endorsement of the crown prince.But the crown prince's unexpected decision to delay taking the throne has made this yet another succession which has departed from the script. His real reasons are not known; public mourning for his father would not have been affected had he been anointed immediately after his father's death. "
733,Viewpoint: Did Thai king help stifle democracy?,"After the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Thailand is preparing for Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn to succeed him on the throne. The king's declining health seemed to coincide with the beginning of a decade-long political crisis, writes Serhat Uenaldi, and in the end Thai democracy died long before the king. The king himself helped kill off democracy in the fateful year of 2006, when he endorsed a military coup against the popular Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and gave royal assent to an interim cabinet.Mr Thaksin, a telecommunications billionaire, had been swept to power in the wake of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. He managed to get Thailand's economy back on track by introducing mildly redistributive policies that benefitted people in previously neglected provincial areas. As a result, he became the first prime minister to complete a full term in office. His popularity soared, partly at the expense of the monarchy. Previously, King Bhumibol had been regarded as the supreme patron of rural Thailand, initiating hundreds of development projects. With Mr Thaksin's rise many came to realise that an elected leader could improve their lives and lead to real structural change. They no longer felt dependent on a supposedly benevolent monarch who ruled by birthright. Obituary: King BhumibolHow King Bhumibol shaped modern Thailand A life in pictures: King Bhumibol AdulyadejBut royalists began to fight back, spearheading a movement against Mr Thaksin which they formed in late 2005. Thaksin, however, proved resilient, backed by the majority of Thais. Poll after poll showed his apparently unbeatable popularity. Without Bhumibol's blessing, he could never have been ousted by a coup in September 2006. Its leaders were granted an audience with the king immediately afterwards which was a clear sign of royal support. If due democratic processes had run their course, Mr Thaksin's economic policies may or may not have proven unsustainable, and his negative human rights track record may have become unacceptable to the majority of Thais. That would have been for the voters to decide. But Thailand's royalists appear to have made that decision for them.Seen in this light, it seems easy to conclude, as some have done, that King Bhumibol was the one to blame for the political mess that followed. In the wake of the 2006 coup, criticism directed at him as the country's most potent anti-democratic player mounted. Mr Thaksin's supporters, journalists and academics began to examine his political track-record critically, in spite of the existence of a law against defaming the monarchy which allows for up to 15 years imprisonment for each act deemed insulting to the king or a member of his family.However, the question of whether man makes history or whether history makes a man - a king, in this instance - looms large over the assessment of King Bhumibol's reign. Is it justified to hold him responsible, or was he in actuality a weak king who simply found himself at the centre of forces that were even bigger than the demi-god he was supposed to be?As so often, the truth lies in between. Thailand's turbulent politics can be best explained by the interplay between King Bhumibol as a leadership figure and Thai society at large. The point is that the king could not have become invested with the authority he had if that authority had not served the purposes of broad sections of the Thai people. When King Bhumibol acceded to the throne in 1946, the Thai monarchy was at a low point after a revolution that ended absolute monarchy in 1932. The king's star only rose when military dictators started again to actively cultivate the charisma of the royal institution to promote royalism to fight communism in the 1950s. Royal traditions were invented or revived, the monarch was paraded around the countryside and abroad, old beliefs in Buddhist and Hindu sources of royal strength were nurtured.And this is how King Bhumibol's reign worked. The enormous power he seemed to hold was in a way given to him by those Thais who drew on royal charisma as a source of legitimacy. The king's advice was what people made of it and what people made of it depended on their interests. Whenever unionists rallied against privatisation by parading images of the king, whenever slum dwellers on royal land referred to their historical bond with the monarchy to counter threats of eviction, whenever a bureaucrat devised a scheme with reference to the king's guiding words of wisdom, whenever businesses attached a royal emblem to the front of their headquarters, whenever military generals purported to protect the king while carrying out coups against civilian governments, they were at the same time strengthening their own position and entrenching the centrality of the monarchy. An example of this was the king's repeated but failed attempt to instil a so-called ""sufficiency"" mind-set in his people through his vague concept of a ""sufficiency economy"" - focus on balanced development that stresses environmental and social responsibilities as much as conventional measures of economic progress. But while environmentalists and opponents of neo-liberalism used the idea to back their calls for a more sustainable and less exploitative economy, nostalgic social conservatives claimed royal sanction for their vision of a country eternally fed by rice farmers who were content with their lot. Opponents of a welfare state and advocates of the free market needed only refer to the king's approval of trade and consumption in the context of sufficiency. In his 1998 birthday speech, King Bhumibol, the nation's biggest capitalist, was quick to clarify that people's frugality should not be excessive and that the consumption of luxurious goods was permissible - a message well-received among Bangkok's middle and upper class.And certainly it was not the king alone who killed Thai democracy. It was the people who profited from his stamp of approval for the coup. They feared that Thaksin was a threat to the monarchy, and therefore to their own source of legitimacy.But coups did not solve their problems. In King Bhumibol's later years, more and more Thais started to question the power of the king because Mr Thaksin had indeed initiated a slow drift away from power based on royal charisma towards leadership based on democratic legitimacy. Consequently, the authority derived from latching on to royal charisma has weakened. It is doubtful that the next Thai monarch will be able to restore the carefully calibrated symbiosis between the monarchy and those sections of the Thai public who had for decades benefitted the most from working towards it. Rumours of the death of that symbiosis might not be exaggerated. Then, Thai democracy might rise again like a phoenix from the ashes.Serhat Uenaldi is the author of Working towards the Monarchy: The Politics of Space in Downtown Bangkok."
734,Can Thailand's rice farmers survive low prices?,"Over the past month the military government in Thailand has announced subsidies for rice farmers of 38bn baht ($1.1bn; £860m) to address a sharp fall in global rice prices. Thailand was once the world’s leading exporter of rice, but lost that status after the collapse of an extravagant price support scheme run by the last elected government. However, the new subsidies have raised awkward questions for the government, which has filed criminal charges against former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and imposed a $1bn fine on her for losses incurred under her scheme."
735,Thailand tiger farms: Hunting the traffickers,"When the Thai authorities moved in to shut down a tiger zoo in a temple at the end of May, they exposed a lot more than just the various irregularities in that one facility. The macabre sight of tiger foetuses preserved in bottles, and the shrivelled, frozen remains of other cubs, suddenly cast the popular tourist attraction into a more sinister light. Was this evidence of illegal trade in tiger parts?As it happens, few experts believe the cub carcasses have much value. The bones, skin, teeth, claws and meat of adult tigers are where the money is made. Officials of Thailand's Department of National Parks, who closed the temple zoo and removed its 147 tigers, did find some evidence of trafficking: amulets containing tiger claws, and a truck attempting to leave the temple with two skins and other small parts. At least three adult tigers had gone missing two years earlier. This, said DNP Deputy Director Adisorn Noochdumrong, suggested continuous involvement in small-scale illegal trafficking by the temple's managers. But his bigger concern is the criminal networks he believes have been encouraging the trade, from this and other so-called ""tiger farms"". There are at least 30 such farms in Thailand, where intensive breeding takes place. They are not illegal but the lack of records in the temple zoo illustrates the weak regulation of these places and allows the possibility of tiger trafficking.""I am quite certain there is a network behind what he have discovered at the temple,"" said Adisorn. ""The temple would not run this alone but tiger trading is hard to verify. The networks are sophisticated and hard to monitor. Influential people are involved.""Adisorn and his team have tried to trace the origins of the impounded tigers through their DNA. He believes there are seven original parent animals, two Siberian tigers, one Malayan tiger and four that died some years ago, for which he has no information. All tigers must be registered with the DNP under Thai law and agreements upheld by Cites, an international treaty to protect endangered species from irresponsible trading. All deaths, births and transfers must also be recorded. But this was not happening. Any argument that breeding these particular tigers was to help in their conservation makes no sense, as they are a mix of different subspecies.Thailand is a hub for the illegal wildlife trade, funnelling endangered animals from Africa and other parts of Asia through neighbouring Laos, where law enforcement is especially weak, and on to Vietnam and China, where the demand is. International pressure has pushed the Thai authorities to become more active in intercepting contraband wildlife shipments but little is being done to break up the syndicates running the trade. Very few arrests have been made.Campaigners monitoring the trade say ""farmed"" tigers are brought into trafficking all too easily because of the lack of regulation and enforcement. It is difficult to tell whether a carcass belongs to a wild or captive tiger but Thai officials believe at least 30% of those being trafficked come from a captive origin. Often they will be drowned in special submersion cages to avoid damaging the valuable skin. Traffickers then ""float"" the wrapped carcasses in the Mekong river from the Thai side and have them picked up by smugglers on the Laotian side.Thai Tiger Temple's long history of controversyEdwin Wiek, who runs an NGO trying to protect threatened wildlife in Thailand, explains why trading captive tigers matters so much to conservationists: ""To stop the trade, these tiger farms need to be closed down - not only the tiger temple but all the other ones as well. ""So that we can say that when tigers are being traded, that we are absolutely sure they are from the wild, and we can do something about it. Breeding a tiger, caring for a tiger until it is an adult costs a lot of money.""He estimates the cost of a farm tiger at $7,000 to $8,000 (£5,600-£6,500). ""When a poacher goes into the jungle he can kill a tiger with one or two bullets, which will be a lot cheaper,"" he says.""So there is a big chance the wild populations are being touched for the same market as captive animals."" The population of captive tigers in Thailand is now estimated to be around 1,500. When the growing numbers being kept in Laos, Vietnam and China are added, the total captive population in this region exceeds the entire world population of wild tigers, which is around 3,800.The economics of tiger farming are baffling and inevitably raise suspicions that some captive animals must be siphoned off for slaughter, in violation of Cites rules. An adult tiger consumes between four and eight kilos of meat a day (9 to 17 lb). An internal Laotian government report, seen by the BBC, openly acknowledges that a tiger farm near the Laotian border town of Thakhek was, until recently, killing 100 tigers a year for commercial use.At Thailand's biggest tiger zoo, Sri Racha, south of Bangkok, the tiger population reached 447 at one point, falling to 323 today. The management there argues that the ideal population is 350. Only a fraction of those can be seen by visitors, via performing tiger shows and - the most popular activity - feeding tiger cubs, which helps explain the huge populations.Tiger produce found on sale in MyanmarTanya Erzinclioglu is a British volunteer who worked at the tiger temple for six years, becoming a self-taught expert on the animals and, she says, trying to ensure their welfare was protected. She believes they were well-treated there, and that any involvement in trafficking was small-scale. But the breeding, she says, was out of control.""I hated it,"" she recalls.""When I first arrived there were 70. By the time we left I'd known 150-plus tigers. That's a double increase in six years, it's ridiculous. We could change a lot of things there, but this was one of the hardest because they thought they made so much money from the cub-feeding, and tourists want the cute babies. And they would come, and the babies were already 10 months old, and then they don't think it's cute, and they write bad reviews. So the management would ask 'why aren't there any cubs?'""Adisorn Noochdumrong and his colleagues at the Department of National Parks are now compiling a database of all captive tigers in Thailand, recording their DNA profiles and distinctive stripe patterns, so that they can be properly traced if they go missing. But there are growing calls now from international groups like the WWF to end tiger farming altogether. The Laotian government has already promised to do this, although whether that actually happens is still in question, given the record there of official tolerance for trafficking. If other countries like Thailand follow suit - and there are officials here now openly arguing for the farms to shut, and just zoos, with mixed animal populations to remain open - that would close one loophole through which the trade in endangered species is able to continue."
736,Bangkok bomb attack: Uighur suspects' trial under way,"The trial of two suspects accused of being behind a bomb attack that killed 20 people in August last year in central Bangkok is under way.Both suspects are ethnic Chinese Uighurs. They pleaded not guilty to the charges in February, and since then have complained of being tortured.Hearings have been delayed because of difficulties finding a Uighur interpreter. The bomb blast occurred at a shrine popular with Chinese and Buddhists.Uighurs - a Turkic-speaking Muslim minority in the far west of China, complain of cultural and religious persecution at the hands of the Beijing authorities.The Chinese embassy has now provided interpreters but the defendants have objected. Both men complained of being tortured while in military custody, but the court has dismissed the complaints. The two defendants were caught three weeks after the blast but 15 other suspects fled the country.Police told local media that 3kg of TNT had been stuffed in a pipe inside the shrine and that an electronic circuit suspected to have been used in the attack was found 30m from the scene. According to official figures at least 123 people had been injured in the attack.A month before the attack the Thai authorities deported more than 100 Uighurs to China - a move that prompted widespread condemnation. The BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok reported at the time that while there were violent elements in the Uighur movement, an attack on this scale outside China would have been unusual.The explosion was on the Ratchaprasong intersection, which has been the centre of political demonstrations in recent years.Eyewitness accounts of the blast - ""There was total chaos""CCTV footage - captures the moment of the explosionThe Erawan Shrine - popular with locals and touristsMobile phone footage captures the blast'I gave one man CPR' says BBC man"
737,"Andy Hall, British labour rights activist, flees Thailand","British labour rights campaigner Andy Hall has left Thailand after a three-and-a-half year legal battle with a pineapple processing company accused, in a report he contributed to, of abusing its workforce.The dismissal of one set of charges against the British activist was confirmed by Thailand's Supreme Court last week. However, he was convicted in September on two other counts under sweeping criminal defamation and computer crimes laws and was given a three-year suspended prison sentence. He also faces civil complaints by the pineapple company, Natural Fruit, which is demanding around $12m (£9.6m; €10.9) in damages.  But it was the prospect of further criminal charges over another group of workers he is supporting that persuaded Mr Hall that he should leave Thailand and not return. He and the 14 migrant workers from Myanmar (Burma) - who have alleged abusive treatment at the hands of a farm which supplied the big Thai poultry processor, Betagro, with chickens - recently had defamation lawsuits filed against them.Before he left Thailand Mr Hall told the BBC that he felt that the prospect of having to contest continuous lawsuits filed against him would make it impossible for him to defend migrant workers' rights effectively. The situation for human rights defenders, he said in a statement made as he prepared to depart, has rapidly deteriorated in Thailand, with significantly increased risks.The challenge confronting Mr Hall is one faced by many Thai activists as well. Unlike many countries, defamation is a criminal charge that can carry a two-year prison sentence. These days it is commonly used alongside the tougher Computer Crimes Act, which mandates a sentence of up to five years in prison.Two years ago, the editors of a small newsletter, Phuketwan, were prosecuted by the Thai navy for an article in which they quoted a Reuters news agency report alleging Thai military involvement in human trafficking. They were finally acquitted last year, but the effort of defending themselves contributed to the newsletter being shut down.In June this year three prominent human rights defenders were prosecuted under the same two laws by a unit of the Thai military over a report they took part in which alleged the use of torture against military detainees in southern Thailand. The laws were also invoked by a military officer, who filed charges against the niece of a conscript who was beaten and tortured to death because she had published details of an internal army investigation into his death.Criminal defamation and computer crimes cases are usually accepted for indictment by the courts in Thailand - lawyers describe the bar for accepting such cases as very low. Defendants must post bail to avoid immediate imprisonment, and then fight their cases over hearings which can stretch out over many years, with no prospect of recovering their legal costs even if they win. The cases are also usually heard in the location where the plaintiff files the complaint, forcing defendants to travel for each hearing.Questions have also been raised about some of the verdicts reached by Thai courts. Andy Hall's lawyers believed they would win the cases against him because he was not quoted in the Finnish report and did not write it, but had only contributed background research. Some human rights groups have described the cases against Mr Hall as ""judicial harassment"" aimed at inhibiting investigations into labour abuses. They have called repeatedly for the criminal defamation and computer crimes laws to be repealed, arguing that they are a serious impediment to freedom of expression in Thailand."
738,UK teacher sought after British colleague dies in Myanmar,"Police in Myanmar are searching for a 25-year-old British teacher after the death of a colleague also from the UK.Officers say Harris Binotti took a flight to Thailand on Saturday and they have requested help from Interpol.Police said the body of a 47-year-old man, named locally as Gary Ferguson, was found with chest and head injuries at Mr Binotti's apartment in Yangon.The dead man's wife is said to have gone to the property when he failed to return home.The two men are reported to have been out drinking together on Friday night.They were both working as English teachers at the Horizon International School in Yangon, in the south of the country previously known as Burma.A spokesman for the school said Mr Ferguson had worked there for a year. Mr Binotti, who is thought to have connections to Dumfries and Aberdeen, had been employed for the past three months. Mr Binotti's neighbours said they heard shouting and banging noises - as if a fight was taking place - in the early hours of Saturday morning.A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: ""We are providing help and support to the family of a British national following a death in Rangoon, Burma, and are in touch with the local authorities."""
739,Thailand's crown prince to be confirmed king on 1 December,"Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn is to be confirmed as the new king of Thailand on 1 December, a senior source has told the BBC.Once confirmed, he is expected to endorse a new, military-drafted constitution and to start appointing his own team of senior royal officials.His father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest-reigning monarch, died on 13 October, aged 88.The government has declared a year-long official mourning period.The widely revered king had served 70 years as head of state, and was seen as a stabilising figure, promoting economic development and social harmony in a country hit by cycles of political turmoil and multiple coups.Obituary: King BhumibolProfile: Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn'Gone, but not forgotten': Social media pays tributeHow King Bhumibol shaped modern Thailand The BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok says there have been concerns expressed quietly over how well his son will perform the same role.Following King Bhumibol's death, he had delayed taking the crown in order to join the people in mourning. The crown prince, who is 64, is much less well known to Thais than his father, and does not have his widespread popularity.Our correspondent says the crown prince will start his reign under a military government that is likely to dictate Thailand's political arrangements for several more years.He is also likely to start appointing his own advisers to senior positions in the palace hierarchy, ending the influence of a number of elderly but powerful men who had served King Bhumibol.Strict lese-majeste laws protect the most senior members of Thailand's royal family from insult or threat. Public discussion of the succession can be punishable by lengthy jail terms.Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha also said on Tuesday that restrictions on entertainment and television in place since the king's death would be lifted on 14 November.He said: ""In terms of entertainment - soap operas and movies - they can go ahead. We simply ask for co-operation. Some programmes need to lower their tone.""TV channels stopped normal broadcasting moments after the death was confirmed, and switched to broadcasts from the Grand Palace and archive footage of the royal family.The PM said that people should still maintain decorum throughout the mourning period and refrain from wearing ""inappropriate attire""."

741,Thai King Bhumibol: Mourners allowed into Grand Palace,"Thousands of mourners are being allowed to enter the throne hall of Bangkok's Grand Palace where the body of Thailand's late King Bhumibol Adulyadej is lying in state. Crowds have gathered outside the palace since the king died two weeks ago, but it is the first time they have been allowed to see his coffin. Authorities say 10,000 mourners will be allowed into the throne hall each day.Official mourning for the king is to last a year. ""I have been waiting here since 01:00,"" said 84-year-old Saman Daoruang, who was sitting in a long queue outside the palace holding portraits of the late monarch.""I haven't been able to sleep because I was so thrilled and proud to come here.""Many mourners wiped away tears as they left the Grand Palace.King Bhumibol, who died aged 88, was widely respected across Thailand and was thought of by many as semi-divine.So far there has been no word on when Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn will formally ascend the throne. The government says he wants time to mourn the death of his father.This morning a thick line of black-clad people stretched across and around the huge royal park next to the Grand Palace. The authorities say they will allow just 10,000 a day to view the elaborate gilded urn in which in older times the king's remains would have been interred - King Bhumibol requested that his body be placed in a coffin instead, which is concealed behind the urn. Many more people are expected to come, straining the resources outside the palace: new toilets are hastily being built and rubbish disposal is proving to be a challenge.

About 40% of the food provided to the public is being wasted.Volunteer groups are now being requested to use recycling containers made of paper or sugarcane bagasse instead of foam boxes.The authorities also say that visitors would reduce the amount of waste by further 20% by bringing their own food boxes and drinking bottles.Water points will be installed in the area for refilling bottles.The authorities have also provided containers for different types of waste, and are stressing the importance of using them correctly."

In the six months between July and December 2015, it received 33 requests from the government of Thailand to remove content.Those requests covered 1,566 individual content items, 97% of which were cited as ""government criticism"". Google says it complied with 85% of the Thai government's requests  - around 1,300 items -  though it did not publish full details on how many items were restricted from viewing within Thailand or removed completely.Article 112 of Thailand's criminal code says anyone who ""defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir-apparent or the regent"" will be punished with up to 15 years in prison.This has remained virtually unchanged since the creation of the country's first criminal code in 1908, although the penalty was toughened in 1976.However, there is no definition of what constitutes an insult to the monarchy.Complaints can be filed by anyone and they must always be formally investigated by the police.

A man was shown being pushed around by a mob and struck on the head. He was later forced to shout ""I love the king"" while onlookers punched and insulted him. On Monday, an elderly woman was struck in the face after commuters forced her to leave a bus. ""How could you insult the royal father? You shouldn't have been born,"" the person who assaulted her was heard shouting on the video.Police later said the woman was mentally ill.   Last week, the government asked people to report cases of lese majeste to authorities and also asked internet service providers to monitor content and block inappropriate material.The military government has also vowed to ""pursue those people who violate the law"".However they have also urged calm following recent incidents of mobs attacks. People have been asked not to judge those who are not wearing mourning colours as some cannot afford to buy new clothes.  The justice minister has also said Thailand would request the extradition of people living abroad who are suspected of insulting the monarchy. He said the government had been monitoring six high-profile exiles.He gave no details but one Thai living in France, Aum Neko, told the BBC she was not worried about the extradition threat because ""France recognises me as a political refugee"".However the 22-year-old added: ""I'm scared of royalists in France who want to hunt me down and hurt me."" Ms Neko, now 22, fled Thailand in 2014 after being summoned by the military government over photos and comments she posted on social media that were considered insulting to the royal family and officials.

749,Thai king's death: Who holds power now?,"Much about the death of King Bhumibol has been as expected. Thailand has been consumed in grief for the loss of a beloved ruler.But the decision to delay anointing his son and designated heir, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, as the next king has caught people by surprise. On the night of 13 October, members of the military-appointed National Legislative Assembly were summoned to a special session two hours after King Bhumibol's death was announced, and they expected they would go through the formality of inviting the crown prince to take the throne. But, following a meeting between him and Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, they were told the name of the next king would not be forwarded to them yet. Instead they held a nine-minute silent tribute to the late king, and went home.Normally the succession should take place immediately after the death of the monarch. On 9 June 1946, for example, King Bhumibol was formally invited to take the throne in a night-time session of parliament, even though this was the same day his elder brother Ananda had been found mysteriously shot dead in his bedroom. The young king was unprepared, but accepted, and then went back to Switzerland to continue studying for four years before returning for his coronation. Throughout that time, though, he was officially the king.The government says the crown prince wants time to mourn his father with the Thai people before taking the throne. It isn't clear yet when that will happen, although the government's legal expert, Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea-Ngam has stressed that it could be at any time, when the crown prince feels ready. Profile: Crown Prince VajiralongkornHow King Bhumibol shaped modern Thailand What do tourists need to know?Who is Thai regent Prem Tinsulanonda?Mr Wissanu has also said that the crown prince does not want his coronation to take place until after a one-year official mourning period is over, and his father's remains have been cremated.So who has real power in Thailand, now that King Bhumibol has gone? His was on paper only limited, constitutional power, to advise and to be consulted. But in practice the huge popularity he acquired over his long reign gave him great influence - his word, or his preferences, could change policy, or even governments. In May 1992, for example, he is credited with ending a bloody stand-off on the streets between the army and pro-democracy demonstrators simply by summoning and scolding the military-backed prime minister, who went into exile, and the protest leader. In April 2006, King Bhumibol broke another political stalemate by suggesting a boycotted election, won by then-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, should be annulled. It was.With no king yet formally anointed, his powers are exercised by a regent, who, under the constitution, is the chairman of the king's privy council. He is 96-year-old Prem Tinsulanonda, one of the late king's closest and most influential advisers, who has in the past expressed reservations about the crown prince's capabilities. As regent, he will carry out important duties like endorsing the new, military-drafted constitution, which must be done within a month. However, the BBC understands that he will exercise those powers in close consultation with the crown prince.But at the moment real power in Thailand still lies with the military junta that seized power two years ago. Many observers believe one of the principal reasons for the coup was to ensure that the ultra-royalist armed forces were in charge when the succession happened.It was the long partnership between the military and King Bhumibol through much of his reign that restored the monarchy from a low point in its fortunes when he acceded in 1946, to the pinnacle of its prestige in the 1990s. The military sees its role primarily as guardian of the monarchy, and it is difficult to imagine any succession scenario in which it does not have an important say.However, the generals are very loyal to King Bhumibol's wishes, and he never wavered from his belief that his son must inherit the throne. While the timeline is uncertain, the government has made it clear that Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn is the undisputed heir, and that he will eventually become king.Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has assured the Thai people that the succession will follow tradition, and that it will go smoothly. He has told them them not to worry about when it will happen, but to unite in sharing happy memories of the late king.That will not stop inevitable speculation over why the succession to so important an institution is being delayed. Like much else in Thailand's monarchy, there is still some mystery and ambiguity in this critical transition."

""He said at this time everyone is sad, he is still sad, so every side should wait until we pass this sad time.""Questions about the crown prince's capabilities have been raised in the past, although the strict lese-majeste laws prevent any open discussion of these.Gen Prayuth took power in a military coup in 2014 which overthrew the civilian government. He has promised elections next year.The monarchy is seen as a unifying force in Thailand at times of political upheaval and King Bhumibol, who died aged 88, was a figure revered by many Thais. The military government has made clear that Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn will be the new king, reports the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok, but it just isn't clear when this will happen.The military has traditionally been intensely loyal to the monarchy.Thailand is beginning a year of official mourning, and entertainment such as TV shows and sports events have been cancelled or toned down.Many Thais are wearing black and mourners have continued to converge on the Grand Palace in central Bangkok to pay their respects to the late king by signing a book of condolences.

753,Profile: Thai regent Prem Tinsulanonda,"The man who now takes the place of the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej is one of the most experienced, canny and influential political figures in modern Thai history.Prem Tinsulanonda, a native of southern Thailand, was also the closest confidant of the king during the last four decades of his reign.Born in Songkhla in 1920, he began his military career in 1941, serving in the brief war with France over Cambodian territory. He later received training in the US in the 1950s and 1960s.From the late 1950s, at a time when Thailand was ruled by a series of military governments, General Prem had parallel military and political careers. He took his first political role in 1959, as part of a committee drafting one of Thailand's many constitutions. He later served as a senator, and eventually as a deputy interior minister in 1977. He rose quickly through the military ranks, but perhaps more significantly, served as a royal aide-de-camp in the palace in 1968 and again in 1975, where he would have come to the attention of King Bhumibol.Obituary: King BhumibolHow King Bhumibol shaped modern ThailandKing Bhumibol: A life in picturesRoyal support was probably instrumental in General Prem's elevation to the most powerful military post of army commander in 1978, which he gained over other senior candidates. Palace backing was also instrumental in engineering General Prem into the prime minister's job in 1980, at a time when Thailand was still under military rule. He was to govern for eight years, an unprecedented tenure, and presided over a period when Thailand began to experience increasing stability and prosperity.The key to this stability was the unusually close partnership between the king and his prime minister. Known for his self-discipline and discretion, General Prem appealed to a monarch who disliked the messy wheeling and dealing of Thailand's notoriously febrile politics.King Bhumibol's personal support helped General Prem survive two coups by dissatisfied military factions in 1981 and 1985. In return the prime minister promoted the monarchy as the indispensable source of legitimacy in Thailand. It helped that under General Prem the communist insurgency dwindled, regional threats to Thailand eased after relations with China were normalised and the country's economy began a surge in growth.When General Prem stepped down in 1988, he was immediately elevated to the 19-member Privy Council, the king's official advisors, which he has dominated ever since. His long military career gave him unparalleled influence within the armed forces and he also proved an astute network-builder in elite Thai business circles. Until the election of populist prime minster Thaksin Shinawatra in 2001, General Prem is believed to have exercised decisive influence over important military promotions.When Mr Thaksin was deposed in a royalist military coup in September 2006, his supporters blamed General Prem for organising it. Two months before, the Privy Council chairman had given a speech to army officers, comparing Thailand to a stable of horses, in which, he implied, the prime minister was only the jockey, and the king the owner.General Prem has remained active until today, at the age of 96, frequently giving speeches warning of the dangers of corruption to Thai society. He was assumed to have lost some influence after the coup in 2014, which was led by officers from the queen's guard faction of the armed forces. But speculation has continued over the extent of his influence over current events. He is also known to have doubts over Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn's ability to perform the role of king, which makes his position now, as regent, politically significant.General Prem remains a controversial figure in Thailand. Some credit him with consolidating the military-palace partnership that has underpinned past periods of stability, and with helping elevate the extraordinary stature of King Bhumibol. Others argue that his endless meddling has contributed to the political instability of the past decade.     "

The majority - 13 - reported their cases this year.Thailand has recorded some 350 cases and Singapore nearly 400, including pregnant women.The Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia are among the countries reporting a handful of cases.The US Communicable Disease Center has advised pregnant women to consider postponing non-essential travel to most of the region, and to avoid Singapore.The Aedes mosquito, which transmits the virus, can be found across a wide swathe of South and South East Asia and northern Australia.Read more: Why Asia should worry about Zika tooZika first originated in Africa, but is believed to have been circulating in Asia since the first half of the 20th Century. Various strains have been circulating for several decades in the region. Singapore has said its outbreak was caused by a local strain, not the one which caused the huge outbreak in South America.An October 2016 WHO report said it was not clear which strain caused the two Zika-linked microcephaly cases there.The two mothers had not travelled outside Thailand. A confirmed link between the local strain of Zika and microcephaly would have a ""significant impact on the global risk assessment"" said the WHO, as it would show that deformation could happen with more than one strain.One reason why Zika is only now being linked to microcephaly in the region could be because tests for the link have only recently been developed.""Because the link was not previously scientifically known, and the disease [Zika] is often very mild, and testing not available, people just did not make the connection,"" says Prof Jesse Goodman, an infectious diseases expert from Georgetown University.There is a lack of data on this, but most experts believe there is a high level of immunity among adults, given the prevalence and long history of the disease in the region.This could mean that ""the outbreaks are likely to be a lot less explosive"" than in South America, says Prof Paul Tambyah, secretary-general of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection.But with some countries like Singapore and Malaysia seeing success with tackling Aedes mosquito numbers, which carries the virus, younger generations may have lesser immunity as they have less exposure to the disease.Read more: Zika travel advice and how to stay safeCountries have been ramping up efforts to destroy mosquito breeding grounds and raise public awareness, as well as screening travellers for Zika.Thailand also said it would test all pregnant women in the provinces where Zika had been detected, and a regional taskforce has been set up to combat the spread of the virus.Experts and the WHO have largely commended regional authorities for their quick responses so far, but there has been some criticism, particularly in Thailand, that governments are not doing enough.Prof Tambyah said authorities need to come up with more innovative ways to fight the disease. He said the region still sees relentless epidemics of dengue - a tropical disease similar to Zika and carried by the same mosquito - despite devoting ""huge amounts of resources"" to mosquito control.Deaths are rare and only one-in-five people infected is thought to develop symptoms. These include:mild feverconjunctivitis (red, sore eyes)headachejoint paina rashA rare nervous system disorder, Guillain-Barré syndrome, that can cause temporary paralysis has been linked to the infection.As there is no vaccine or treatment, the only option is to reduce the risk of being bitten.Health officials advise people to:use insect repellentscover up with long-sleeved clotheskeep windows and doors closedensure mosquitoes have nowhere to breed by removing standing waterPatients are advised to rest and drink plenty of fluids.A birth defect where a baby is born with an abnormally small head, as their brain has not developed properly.The severity varies, but it can be deadly if the brain is so underdeveloped that it cannot regulate the functions vital to life.Children that do survive face intellectual disability and development delays.

761,Profile: King Bhumibol Adulyadej,"King Bhumibol Adulyadej is the world's longest-reigning monarch. Still widely-revered in Thailand, the 88-year-old king was in the past seen as a stabilising influence in a country which, during his reign, has seen numerous military coups, 19 constitutions and even more prime ministers.Though he is a constitutional monarch with limited powers, many Thais regard him as semi-divine, and his usually opaque public utterances are minutely dissected for advice to his people. Officially the King is above politics, but King Bhumibol has intervened in times of high tension, and is credited with finding non-violent resolutions to some crises.However critics argue that the King has endorsed military takeovers, and at times failed to speak out against human rights abuses. During the political turmoil of the past decade some supporters of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra have accused senior royal officials of taking sides against him.King Bhumibol Adulyadej acceded to the throne on 9 June 1946 after his brother, King Ananda Mahidol, died in a still unexplained shooting accident at the Royal Palace in Bangkok.He was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where his father was studying, and he was later educated in Switzerland. He returned there to finish his studies before returning to Thailand where he was crowned in May 1950.The status of the monarchy had been in decline since the abolition of absolute monarchy in 1932, and then the abdication of King Prajadhipok, King Bhumibol's uncle, in 1935.In his early years King Bhumibol was overshadowed by a series of powerful military leaders. But with the support of other royal princes and sympathetic generals he rebuilt the monarchy's profile, making a series of tours to outlying provinces, and through numerous royal projects that established his lifelong concern with agricultural development.In 2006, then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan presented him with the United Nations' first Human Development Lifetime Achievement Award.The current public reverence for King Bhumibol appears genuine, but it has also been carefully nurtured by a formidable palace public relations machine, and by harsh ""lese-majeste"" laws that punish any criticism of the monarchy with up to 15 years in prison.King Bhumibol's first public intervention in Thailand's chaotic politics occurred in 1973, when pro-democracy demonstrators in Bangkok were fired on by soldiers and were allowed to shelter in the royal palace, a move which led to the collapse of the administration of the then Prime Minister, General Thanom Kittikachorn.But he failed to prevent the lynching of left-wing students by paramilitary vigilantes three years later, at a time when the monarchy feared the growth of communist sympathies after the end of the Vietnam War.In 1981, King Bhumibol stood up to a group of army officers who had staged a coup against the prime minister, and the king's personal friend, General Prem Tinsulanond. Units loyal to the king then retook Bangkok.In 1992 he again intervened when dozens of demonstrators were shot after protesting against an attempt by a former coup leader, General Suchinda Kraprayoon, to become prime minister. The king summoned General Suchinda and the protest leader, retired General Chamlong Srimuang, and had TV cameras film him scolding them while they were on their knees. Electoral democracy was restored after than, and a new constitution written.During the crisis that erupted over the leadership of the then Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra in 2006, the king was frequently asked to intervene but insisted this would be inappropriate. However, his influence was still viewed as pivotal when the election Mr Thaksin had won that April was quickly annulled by the courts. His precise role in the coup that deposed Mr Thaksin that year is unknown, although his advisors say he was not informed about it in advance.In recent years the king's name and image continued to be invoked by royalist protest groups trying to unseat pro-Thaksin governments. However the king himself was in poor health, and remained silent. Army chief Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha subsequently seized power in another military coup in May 2014.Three months later, in August, King Bhumibol formally endorsed Gen Prayuth as the new prime minister.In his younger days, King Bhumibol enjoyed a wide variety of pursuits, including photography, playing and composing songs for the saxophone, painting and writing.He even received a patent for his development of an artificial rain-making technique.The king has suffered from increasingly frail health in recent years, and has spent much of his time in hospital after being admitted for a lung infection in September 2009."
762,Thai pop song causes anger in marketing industry,"A Thai pop star has agreed to change his latest song after people working in the marketing industry said it cast them in a bad light.""Lost friends because of direct sales"" by hip-hop artist Natee ""Oui"" Eakwichit, tells the story of a man who takes a job as a network marketer and finds himself losing all his friends as a result of his incessant sales pitches to join his multi-level marketing (MLM) scheme, TNN24 news website reports. ""I called them but they didn't answer. I met them but they didn't wanna talk,"" the would-be salesman laments. Released a week ago, the catchy tune with its refrain of ""Rich, rich, rich!"" has already been viewed nearly one million times on YouTube.However, the lyrics have attracted the attention of Kritanong Suwannawong, leader of the People Network Power Party who says that the song ""misunderstands"" network marketing and portrays people in the profession as unscrupulous MLM peddlers pushing illegal pyramid schemes, the Bangkok Post reports. While acknowledging that such people exist, she tells the paper ""Every profession has the good and the bad,"" but the lyrics portray everybody in that line of work as ""bad and unwanted persons"".It is a criticism taken up by others working in the industry, who took to social media to call for the song to be banned, or for Oui write another song showing the positive side to the profession. In the end, a happy compromise has been reached with a subtle change to the song's title, which is now ""Lost friends due to indirect sales"". Oui is also allowing marketing companies to use the song for free, saying it might cheer up their staff, the Bangkok Post reported.Next story: Controversy over Russian sporting club's 'campaign medal'Use #NewsfromElsewhere to stay up-to-date with our reports via Twitter."
763,"Meet Joshua Wong, a 19-year-old activist who is trying to change China","Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong has been barred from entering Thailand, where he'd been planning to speak to students.The 19-year-old became the face of the Hong Kong street protests in 2014.He was detained on arrival at Suvarnabhumi airport on Wednesday.A student group has alleged that the move was made by Thailand at the request of China but the Thai government has denied giving any order for Mr Wong's detention.The military leaders, in power since a 2014 coup, said immigration officials had made the decision to bar him, although no reason for doing so has been given.China's foreign ministry said it had noted the reports and respected Thailand's immigration control.Joshua Wong has since returned to Hong Kong and spoken to the Chinese press. But who is Joshua Wong and why is he of such concern to governments in both China and Thailand?Joshua Wong is a student activist from Hong Kong who came to international attention in 2014 when he led a boycott of classes to protest against the political system in China.He has since staged more protests in China and has been branded an extremist by the Chinese press.Internationally, he was listed as one of Time Magazine's most influential teens in 2014 and by Fortune magazine as one of the world's greatest leaders in 2015.Aged just 15, he and some friends set up a group called ""Scholarism"" aimed, he says, at giving students a political voice.In an interview with a Hong Kong newspaper he explained why.""Even though students are under-age, non-professional and lack social status, they still have a role to play in intervening government policies.""Mr Wong had been invited by Thai student activist Netiwit Chotipatpaisal to address students at Chulalongkorn University to mark the 40th anniversary of a massacre of students in 1976.Mr Netiwit had told the South China Morning Post newspaper ahead of the visit that it could inspire Thai students to speak against the military leadership.But when he arrived in Bangkok in the early hours of Wednesday, Mr Wong was detained.""They forced me to stay inside the police station and stay in prison for 12 hours,"" Mr Wong said at a press conference back in Hong Kong.""When I asked what's the reason for them to detain me at Bangkok, they just say that, 'We will not give any explanation.'""Joshua lives in Hong Kong, an area governed by Britain until 1997, which is now meant to be an autonomous region of China.But critics say the Chinese government is trying to erode the controls agreed when power was transferred, and many like Joshua are protesting against that.In 2014 he led protests against a decision that China chooses any candidate standing for election in Hong Kong.In 2007 China promised Hong Kong residents they would be granted ""universal suffrage"" - where everybody has the vote.This happened but there was a catch. Voters in the region can only select from a list of candidates selected by leaders in Beijing.China said granting direct, open voting would cause a ""chaotic society"".Joshua Wong says Hong Kong is only ""semi-democratic"" and wants other students to ""care more"" about politics.He believes students are the perfect people to spread that message because he says they're, by their nature, ""idealistic"".His message is clear - he wants a free society where everyone has the chance to nominate and vote for potential candidates to Hong Kong's chief-executive. He says peaceful protests would be ideal, but says sometimes it's necessary to resort to ""civil disobedience"".His movement had an immediate impact on Hong Kong politics.  In 2012 the group led a rally of 120,000 students, helping to overturn a pro-China national education programme by occupying the government's headquarters.Leaders were forced to shelve the plans, designed to teach pupils about the ""advanced, selfless and united"" Chinese Communist Party.In 2014, Joshua and his fellow students blocked central Hong Kong by refusing to go to lessons and instead, gathered in the streets.The initial protests were planned by the Occupy Central movement, but their members joined protests early.""Rather than encouraging the students to join, we are encouraged by the students to join,"" said Benny Tai, one of the three main organisers of the Occupy movement.""We are touched and moved by the work of the students.""Wong was identified as a threat to the security of the ruling Communist Party.He was one of 78 people arrested after leading a charge at the government headquarters and he was held, without charge, for more than 40 hours. The government said releasing him would compromise further investigations, but a court disagreed. It said his detention was legal, but holding him for longer was illegal.Despite letting him go, police have said they still reserve the right to prosecute, or re-arrest him.He mobilised protests with the use of the FireChat app, which allows users to communicate without internet access.Find us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat"
764,Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong barred from entering Thailand,"Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong has been barred from entering Thailand and deported.Mr Wong, who became the face of the 2014 Hong Kong street protests, had been hoping to speak to Thai students.But the 19-year-old was detained on arrival at Suvarnabhumi airport and then flown back to Hong Kong.He said there had been ""no explanation for his detention"", but activists attributed the decision to intervention from Beijing.Mr Wong was at the heart of the mass demonstrations against Beijing that brought parts of Hong Kong to a standstill in late 2014.The protesters were calling for free elections for Hong Kong's leadership. The protests failed to achieve their goal, but several of their leaders have since entered politics.Mr Wong had been invited by Thai student activist Netiwit Chotipatpaisal to address students at Chulalongkorn University to mark the 40th anniversary of a massacre of students in 1976.Mr Netiwit had told the South China Morning Post newspaper ahead of the visit that it could inspire Thai students to speak against the military leadership.But when he arrived in Bangkok in the early hours of Wednesday, Mr Wong was detained. ""They forced me to stay inside the police station and stay in prison for 12 hours,"" Mr Wong said at a news conference back in Hong Kong. ""When I asked what's the reason for them to detain me at Bangkok, they just say that 'we will not give any explanation'.""Thailand's military leaders, in power since a 2014 coup, denied any role in the detention. But Mr Netiwit said on Facebook that police told him they had received a letter from China regarding the visit, without providing proof of his claim.The Nation newspaper also quoted an immigration official as saying a request to blacklist Joshua Wong came from China. Nathan Law, a fellow Hong Kong protest leader who has since been elected to parliament, told local radio Beijing was worried Mr Wong ""would bring (his) influence to other countries"". Hong Kong authorities said they had asked Thailand to respect Mr Wong's rights. China's foreign ministry, meanwhile, said it respected Thailand's immigration control.Rights groups condemned the move. Amnesty International said it underscored government willingness to suppress freedom of expression and raised serious concerns ""about how China is using its influence over Thai authorities"". Last May, Mr Wong was denied entry to Malaysia where he had been set to take part in talks about democracy in China.  In recent years, Thailand has faced criticism for its co-operation with Beijing.Last year, Hong Kong publisher Gui Minhai disappeared while on holiday in Thailand. He later appeared on Chinese state TV, saying he had voluntarily handed himself over to the authorities over a drink-driving fatality years ago.There was widespread speculation that he had been deported to China at Beijing's request because of his involvement with a publishing house which published material critical of China's leaders. The UN condemned Thailand last year for deporting two Chinese dissidents it had given refugee status. The men had been in detention for illegal entry and rights group believe they were returned to China. "

766,Inver House Distillers posts sharp fall in profits,"Thai-owned Scotch whisky producer Inver House Distillers has reported a sharp fall in revenue and profits.  The Airdrie-based company, whose single malts include Old Pulteney, Speyburn, anCnoc and Balblair, said pre-tax profits fell 19.5% last year to £9.5m.Turnover was also down by 15.2% to £67.2m.Inver House, which is owned by ThaiBev, said the drop was largely due to a reduction in sales of bulk whiskies and other ""value-for-money"" products.It also cited a major reorganisation of distribution arrangements in its key US market.Inver House said it remained focused on the long-term global success of its brands, having completed a £10m investment programme which included boosting production capacity at its Speyburn distillery in Moray.In its results statement, the distiller said its core brands had continued to perform strongly in most of its markets.Its ""super-premium"" small batch gin Caorunn, which is made at Balmenach Distillery in the Spey valley, also performed strongly, with sales up in value by 65% on last year. Inver House managing director Graham Stevenson said: ""Although our reported profits have fallen, our actual results are slightly ahead of expectations. ""2015 was the start of a period of transition as we began to reduce our reliance on bulk and lower value products, and we took the opportunity to make significant changes to our distribution arrangements in the very important US market.'We have strong brands which continue to grow despite difficult trading conditions in numerous markets.""

770,The magpie that saved a family,"Sam Bloom fell into a deep depression after a fall from a roof terrace during a family holiday left her paralysed from the chest down. But help was to come from an unexpected source - a magpie chick which had fallen from its nest. When the family took in the bird, it brought joy back to their home and allowed Sam to make a new start.Sam Bloom doesn't remember falling. The last thing she remembers is admiring the view from the terrace of their hotel in Thailand.  It was January 2013 and she was on a family holiday with husband, Cameron, and their three young boys in a small coastal village on the Andaman Sea. After a morning swim in the sea they discovered the hotel had a rooftop terrace and all bounded up the stairs to take in their surroundings. Suddenly Cameron heard a tremendous crash. He turned around and Sam was gone - as was the railing she had been leaning against.  He ran over and saw Sam lying on the concrete floor, two storeys below - a fall of about 6m. Cameron screamed and ran down. When he reached Sam he saw that she had bitten through her tongue and her eyes had rolled back into her head. ""She had this huge lump on her back and I realised that she had probably done some really horrific damage to her spine,"" he says. There was no time to shield the boys from the sight of their mother's injuries. Cameron remembers hearing Rueben, the eldest, asking: ""Is Mummy going to die?"" ""I knew she was alive but the blood started seeping from Sam's head and I really worried that her head injury was going to cause her death,"" says Cameron. Listen to Sam and Cameron Bloom speaking to Outlook on the BBC World ServiceGet the Outlook podcast for more extraordinary real-life storiesWhen Sam woke up she was strapped to a board in the local hospital, where doctors took an X-ray and shook their heads.On arrival at a larger hospital, four hours' drive away, Sam's blood pressure was too low to operate. Her skull was fractured in several places, her brain was bleeding and bruised, both lungs had ruptured and one had collapsed completely. Her spine was shattered just below the shoulder blades. But four days later the surgeons were able to operate, and she pulled through. Six weeks later, Sam was strong enough to be flown back home to Australia, where she was finally given an MRI scan - and a prognosis. ""The doctor came in and said: 'On a scale of moderate to severe, you're severe,'"" says Sam. ""That's when I said: 'Will I ever walk again?'""He just went: 'No, you'll never walk again.' And that was it. So blunt. ""It was the worst thing anyone ever said to me. I pulled the sheet over my head and burst into tears. And I never saw him again.""  Sam fell into a deep depression. ""I was so angry. I'm still angry to be honest. I was also really angry at myself."" She couldn't believe that she had leant on that safety rail - the wooden posts supporting it had been rotten through and through. The next six months in hospital were tough. Cameron and the boys often found Sam crying when they came to visit. Meanwhile Cameron was adapting their house on the beach in Sydney to accommodate a wheelchair. ""We really looked forward to the day that Sam came home.  We thought that everything would be much better and her spirits would lift,"" he says.The opposite turned out to be the case.When Sam came home she was immediately confronted by everything she could no longer do. Surfing and running on the beach had been a big part of her life - and the house looked out on to her favourite surf spot. ""I actually did wish I'd died,"" says Sam. But three months later something unexpected happened. Sam and the boys were visiting her mother.  It was a very windy day and as they were heading home Noah, her middle son, spotted a baby magpie that had fallen to the ground. So they picked it up and took it home.   ""We called her Penguin because she looked like a penguin,"" says Sam. ""She was just white and fluffy and had really big feet."" At first they thought she had a broken wing, but it turned out she hadn't. She was just very fragile at two or three weeks old.A vet told them it was a big commitment and that she would have to be fed every two hours, but they decided rescuing this little bird would be a great thing to do together.  ""I loved having her around because she was like company,"" says Sam. ""She was pretty much on my lap or on my shoulder from the moment we brought her home. She was just company and she'd make us laugh."" Sam could finally unburden herself without feeling guilty.""I would talk to her, I'd whinge, tell her how I was. ""I don't think Cam wanted to hear it any more. Penguin knows it all."" Penguin could be quite moody, says Cameron. ""Some mornings she'd be cross and give you a little peck on the hand - at other times she would just run down the hall and jump up into bed, work her way into the doona (quilt) and then roll over and sleep. So it was hysterical.""  The boys played with Penguin by throwing her a small stick or a sock, which she'd catch. ""They loved her,"" says Cameron. He soon found himself taking pictures of the quirky magpie. ""Penguin provided so many crazy opportunities to take photos,"" he says.  He created an Instagram account for her and she soon had thousands of followers. Penguin roamed free but there were drawbacks - she was not toilet-trained, and the house got quite messy. As she grew older, the family tried to encourage her out into the garden.Eventually Penguin did sleep outside, but at six o'clock in the morning she'd be at the back door, with a special call that meant, ""Let me in!""As her independence grew, she stayed away for longer periods and one summer, when she was a year old, she disappeared for six weeks. The family were distraught. But on the day of Rueben's 13th birthday, Penguin made a surprise visit. She stayed for another eight months. A year ago, she left and hasn't been seen since.  The rescued bird has found her freedom - and Sam has a new-found freedom of her own. Three years ago she took up kayaking and last summer she made the Australian para-kayaking team. ""I'm out of the wheelchair, I'm in the water and back in nature, which I missed."" Over the two years that Penguin stayed with the family, Cameron, a professional photographer, took about 14,000 pictures of her. The photographs went viral but nobody knew about the family's struggle. This story has now been told by the author Bradley Trevor Greive, in a book filled with Cameron's pictures.It was through the book that Sam first found out how her sons had reacted to seeing her unconscious on that concrete floor.""I did cry when I read about the accident,"" she says. ""Noah had hot tears streaming down his cheeks. You feel guilty as a mum putting your kids through that."" Cameron thinks the magpie rescued the family as much as they rescued her. ""Sam was in an incredibly dark place when she came home and when Penguin arrived in our lives it changed the mood in the house. It changed Sam dramatically."" Sam agrees.""Oh I loved her,"" she says. ""I absolutely adored her."" Cameron Bloom's images have now been collected in a book called Penguin Bloom, which also tells the story of Sam's accident and recovery. In the epilogue Sam is candid about living with a spinal injury. ""Being paralysed is a little like waking up from a coma to find you are 120 years old,"" she writes. ""Your family and friends want you to be happy that you are still alive, but everything you do is very slow and very painful, and so much of what you enjoyed most, the things that actually made you feel alive, are now quite impossible."" She says she got through it thanks to her family, exercise and yes, the friendship of a bird - as the promotional video says, ""Angels come in all shapes and sizes.""

772,"Thailand's military allows 'culture of torture', says Amnesty","Thailand's military government has allowed a ""culture of torture"" to flourish since assuming power, says a new report by rights group Amnesty International.The report lists 74 alleged cases of torture and other ill-treatment, including methods such as beatings and waterboarding, by soldiers and police.The military seized power in 2014 after months of political unrest, saying it wanted to restore stability.It has denied allegations of torture. ""Our investigations into such allegations have shown no indication of torture, I have seen no indication of torture and the Thai people have seen no indication of torture,"" Gen Sansern Kaewkamnerd, a spokesman for the prime minister's office, told Reuters.Amnesty was due to hold a press conference in Bangkok on Wednesday to release the report.But it was cancelled at the last minute after officials warned that speakers could face arrest under labour laws.""We are not singling out the Thai government,"" Amnesty's Asia media manager Omar Waraich told Reuters.""We are here on business visas, we have an office in Thailand."" Rafendi Djamin, Amnesty International's director for South East Asia and the Pacific, said Thailand ""may claim to be tough on torture, but actions speak louder than words"". ""[Its] military rulers have allowed a culture of torture to flourish, where there is no accountability for the perpetrators and no justice for the victims.""Thailand had earlier defended its rights records since the coup, with the coup leader and current Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha saying that ""every country has gone through rough times"".In a speech earlier this month he told countries criticising Thailand: ""Don't tell us that we abuse rights, you also abuse the rights of others."" He has promised that an election will be held next year.  Since coming to power, the military government - officially known as the National Council for Peace and Order - has jailed critics, censored the media and cracked down on dissidents.Article 44 of an interim constitution gives the government powers to ""disrupt or suppress"" anything deemed a threat to national security. It also allows for soldiers to detain people for up to a week without a warrant. "
773,Thai tourism video stirs cultural heritage debate,"A music video promoting Thailand's tourism industry has been edited after the government complained about its playful use of characters from classical literature.The video was released earlier this month and shows four people in traditional Khon masks dancing their way around the country's tourist sights. As well as visiting temples and snapping selfies on the beach, they're shown doing a host of other activities including go-karting and whizzing down a zip wire. Among the characters depicted is Thotsakan, a king of giants in Thailand's national epic Ramakien, The Nation explains.The original version has racked up more than a million views on YouTube so far, but last week the culture ministry said the way it used Thotsakan was ""inappropriate"", and that some scenes must be cut. ""Thotsakan is the king of giants. He is a grand, formidable character. So, he is not supposed to engage in things like sweetmeat cooking,"" permanent secretary Apinan Poshyananda was quoted as saying. The video's director, Bandit Thongdee, said he just wanted to put a modern spin on traditional Thai culture, but agreed to re-edit it in order to meet the ministry's requirements. The new video was released on Monday. The Nation compared the two versions and highlighted ""seven things that Thotsakan can't do"" - in the culture ministry's opinion. Cycling and horse riding are off-limits, and there's no race track fun for Thotsakan in the new video. Images of him cooking, riding on a speedboat and enjoying coconut juice in a deckchair with his pals have been cut, too, as has that most modern of pastimes - taking selfies.The video prompted a debate over how traditional characters should be portrayed in modern day Thailand. A Change.org petition in support of the original video gathered more than 70,000 signatures in less than a week, although the newspaper reported that some on social media felt the ministry was simply protecting the country's heritage.Next story: China city blocks sale of tiny 'pigeon nest' homesUse #NewsfromElsewhere to stay up-to-date with our reports via Twitter."

It was concealed in many rubbish bags.""He said he did not know the gender of the victim at this stage."
775,Thai police raid unearths dismembered body in freezer,"Thai police who raided a suspected passport-forging operation in Bangkok say they found guns, drugs and the dismembered body of a man in a freezer.Officers say they have no idea who the man was and what his links to the forgery operation might be. Five foreigners were arrested and one police officer was shot and wounded during the operation.Quantities of fake passports were also found at the flat in the Phra Kanong district of the city.Bangkok police chief Sanit Mahathavorn said those arrested were three English-speaking men and a Burmese maid and her husband.Thai media said the three English speakers were two Americans and one Briton but this was not confirmed.Police said that during the raid one of the suspects turned from a safe he was opening and opened fired, injuring one officer.A body of a ""foreign man with blond hair"" was then found inside a large freezer on the ground floor.""His body was cut with a sharp object into six pieces, put in a black bag and brought into the freezer,"" the police chief told reporters.He said the suspects were being questioned at a police station in south-west Bangkok.BBC South-East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head says the trade in forged and stolen passports is a big business in Thailand.The trade was highlighted after the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 two years ago, he adds, when two Iranian men on board were found to have been travelling on stolen passports bought in Thailand."
776,Andy Hall: Thai court finds UK activist guilty of defamation,"A UK activist who campaigned for the rights of migrant workers in Thailand's fruit industry has been found guilty of defamation and computer crimes.Andy Hall, from Lincolnshire, was given a three-year suspended jail term and fined 150,000 baht ($4,300; £3,300).Hall had contributed to a report by a Finnish watchdog, Finnwatch, in 2013 alleging the Natural Fruit Company mistreated its workers. Finnwatch said it was ""shocked"" by the verdict.""Andy has been made a scapegoat in order to stifle other voices that speak out legitimately in support of migrant worker rights,"" said executive director Sonja Vartiala.""This is a sad day for freedom of expression in Thailand. We fear that many other human rights defenders and victims of company abuse will be scared to silence by this ruling.""Speaking to the BBC before he went into court, Hall said it would be incredibly unjust if he was convicted, but that he was grateful for the international attention the case had brought to migrant rights in Thailand. Hall's sentence was suspended for two years, meaning he will not go to jail. Because the report was published online in Thailand, he was also found guilty of violating the Computer Crimes Act.A spokesman for the British embassy in Bangkok said they would be raising the matter with the Thai authorities.This verdict will send a shiver through Thailand's already nervous human rights community. By their very nature human rights, and in this case labour rights reports, rely on anonymous testimony. Vulnerable people usually don't want to risk their already fragile lives and livelihoods.So in court Andy Hall was repeatedly asked to prove his allegations of low wages, and dire conditions against the pineapple processing giant. Despite bringing his research notes, photos and several witnesses to court it wasn't enough. In their summing up the judges gave weight to Natural Fruit's evidence that government inspectors had regularly visited the factory and found no serious issues. Andy Hall's escaped jail, but for those who care about freedom of expression in Thailand this was a sad day.  The Finnwatch report - Cheap has a High Price - included allegations that migrant workers were being paid wages below the legal minimum, working long hours at factories and had had their passports illegally confiscated.Natural Fruit, one of Thailand's biggest pineapple producers, denied all the allegations and brought charges against Hall, who was living in Thailand at the time.Owner Wirat Piyapornpaiboon had said the report caused damage to him and his company.Thailand has grown to become one of the world's biggest food producers, but is repeatedly criticised for the treatment of migrant workers. The frequent use of the criminal defamation law in Thailand to silence critics has been condemned by human rights groups.The US-based Human Rights Watch said Hall had co-ordinated ""important research"" and that prosecuting him raised ""serious questions about Thailand's readiness to protect workers' rights""."

779,Leicester City: Artist completes Buddhist mural,"The final mural in a series of six showcasing Leicester City's title win has been finished. The work, which celebrates the Thai heritage of the club's owners, has been painted onto the side of the Grade-II* Newarke Houses Museum. There had been opposition to the work from Historic England but it was approved by the city council. The Foxes shocked the football world in May when they won the Premier League at odds of 5,000/1. The six murals, showcasing different elements of the title win, were commissioned by Leicester City Council.Leicester City were taken over by Thai businessman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha in 2010. The duty free magnate, who is believed to be a Buddhist, is estimated by Forbes to have a net worth of $3.3bn.

784,Thai university creates Pokemon-style parasite app,"A Thai university has created a Pokemon Go-inspired app with an educational aim - to raise awareness about potentially lethal parasitic diseases.The mobile app, called Parasite Hunt, challenges players to seek out various beacons using hints on their smartphones, and then scan a code to reveal a virtual parasite, The Nation website reports. It's been developed for a science fair at Khon Kaen University in north-eastern Thailand, home to a centre for tropical disease research. The app aims to teach youngsters about the dangers of eating raw freshwater fish, a common practice in parts of the region, which raises the risk of contracting the parasitic disease opisthorchiasis and developing bile duct cancer.Once a player has found the virtual parasite, they have to answer questions in order to receive points. ""The highest-scoring players will get rewards,"" says Assistant Prof Dr Nisana Namwat, who leads the university's bile cancer screening and care centre. ""Information about the diseases and parasites will be stored on a collection page and can be read at any time,"" she says.Opisthorchiasis is described as a disease of poor communities, endemic in villages which rely on fishing. The university says there's a general lack of knowledge about the dangers posed by parasites, which can remain in the body for up to 20 years. It says the game is a fun way to engage youngsters, in the hope that they pass on their newly acquired knowledge to others.Next story: China staff fined for not liking boss's Weibo postsUse #NewsfromElsewhere to stay up-to-date with our reports via Twitter."

786,The surreal investigations into Thailand's unresolved bombings,"If the investigation of last week's multiple bomb attacks in southern Thailand follows the pattern of that into the bombing of the Erawan Shine in Bangkok exactly a year ago, we are in for a surreal ride. What we may not see is any convincing explanation for what happened.Like the spate of small bombs last week, the attack in Bangkok on 17 August last year was something new. Never before had such a large, deadly device been detonated at a symbolically-powerful location popular with foreign tourists. Twenty people died, and more than 120 were injured. The immediate response of the military authorities was to deny any possibility that this was a terrorist attack. The next response was to deny any possibility that it might be retribution for a controversial decision a month before to deport 109 Muslim Uighur asylum-seekers back to China, where they faced harsh treatment as suspected insurgents. This despite the fact that the shrine was known to be popular with Chinese tourists.Instead military spokesmen dropped heavy hints that their domestic political opponents - supporters of ousted Prime Ministers Thaksin and Yingluck Shinawatra - were to blame. Even when two suspects were caught, both of them ethnic Uighurs, the Thai authorities initially refused to confirm their Chinese nationality, and insisted they were merely part of a people-smuggling gang frustrated over police operations constricting their business. This official view has remained unchanged to this day, notwithstanding the discovery of large quantities of bomb-making materials in the same apartment where Bilal Mohammed, the first suspect, was apprehended.But the police continued to try to link the attack with the opposition red-shirt movement. They stated last September that one of the key suspects was a known red-shirt activist, appropriately named Mr Odd, with links to a woman who was among 15 people believed to have fled to Turkey in the wake of the bombing. His photograph was circulated, but then the police appeared to lose all interest in him. Neither did they make any visible efforts to get the 15 other suspects extradited from Turkey, despite the fact that one of them, a Uighur man named Abudustar Abdulrahman, who had flown out of Bangkok the night before the bomb, was believed to have played a central role in organising the attack.Meanwhile the police put on a bizarre spectacle, awarding themselves a large pile of cash, equivalent to around $80,000, which had been raised as a reward for information leading to convictions. The two detained suspects have since been indicted and held in a military base, with very few people allowed access to them. Bilal Mohammed has been charged with placing the bomb under a seat in the shrine - the man caught on security camera videos that night - even though he looks quite different, and police had at first insisted he was not the man in the video. He has denied the charge and has written a letter insisting he was only trying to reach Turkey, using people-smugglers in Thailand. Both men are being tried in a military court. The only translator found in Bangkok who can speak their language has since been arrested for drug offences, so they now have no way to follow court proceedings. Both men have pleaded not guilty, and have hinted that they have been abused in custody. Bilal Mohammed broke down in tears on his way to court in May and shouted that he was ""not an animal"". Their lawyer has advised that their best option is to plead guilty and hope for leniency.Immediately after last week's bombings, the military authorities again suggested the most likely culprits were ""those who have lost power"", the same phrase used last year to point at the red-shirt opposition.  Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha pointedly asked why the bombings had taken place right after the military had succeeded in getting its constitution - opposed by the red-shirts - approved in a national referendum.Any thought that the attacks could be considered terrorism was once again dismissed. They were, said a police commander, just ""domestic sabotage"". Any possible link to the long-running separatist insurgency in Thailand's southern-most provinces was likewise dismissed, although those familiar with that conflict believe this is the most likely scenario. More recent comments by the military authorities are starting to acknowledge that possibility, and in his latest remarks the prime minister has said the government is not accusing any group.Why does the military obfuscate the investigation of such critical events with so many baffling statements?One obvious factor is the fear that tourism will be adversely affected if there is any suggestion of terrorism. Estimates vary, but tourism accounts for between 9% and 20% of the economy (depending on whether direct or indirect contributions are counted), and it is just about the only part of the economy which is growing. Big terrorist incidents, like the Bali bomb in 2002, and more recent attacks in Turkey, do drive foreigners away. But the Bangkok bomb last year had only a brief impact, and provided there are no further attacks, the effect this time will probably also be limited.Another factor is the embarrassment of such attacks to a military government that seized power in the name of restoring peace and order. The latest attacks took place on the 84th birthday of Queen Sirikit, an auspicious anniversary for Thais and one the ultra-royalist military had wanted celebrated openly across the country. In Hua Hin, the favourite residence of the royal family outside Bangkok, and the site of one of the attacks - the celebration had to be held inside a military barracks. And acknowledging that the southern militants may be involved would underscore the military's failure even to contain, let alone resolve, a conflict which has cost more than 6,000 lives.The experience of previous violent events in Thailand is not encouraging. Very few have ever been fully investigated. The massacre of students in Bangkok in 1976; of pro-democracy protesters in 1992; the killing of more than 90 people during an occupation of Bangkok by the red-shirt movement in 2010, and the subsequent military operation against it; and the deaths of 30 people in the rival yellow-shirt occupation of 2013-2014 before the coup - details of all these events remain disputed, their causes unexplained, and most of the perpetrators unpunished. No-one should be surprised if the bombings, last year and this year, produce a similar outcome."

791,Who is behind the Thailand bombings?,"Eleven small bombs, detonated at popular tourist spots, in locations spread across southern Thailand. Who would carry out such an attack, and why? The Thai police have ruled out any links to international terrorism. They also dismissed the likelihood that it was the separatist insurgent groups which have been fighting the Thai armed forces in the three Malay-Muslim provinces on the Thai-Malaysian border for the past 12 years. Government spokesmen have instead described these attacks as ""domestic sabotage"", and hinted that the most likely perpetrators are those who lost out in the referendum last Sunday. That vote approved a new constitution which entrenches long-term military influence in Thai politics, and was opposed by the party of ousted Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, and her so-called ""red-shirt"" supporters. The clear hint from the military is that this is where they will direct their investigation.But while there were small armed groups on the fringe of the red-shirt movement which carried out sporadic attacks in the turmoil leading up to the 2014 coup, they have done nothing since then, and the military has kept a close watch on them. Such co-ordinated attacks in a region where the red shirts have almost no presence would appear to be beyond them. But they cannot be ruled out. By contrast the style of the attacks - twin bombings, catching those who gather to look at the first blast - are very typical of the insurgents, loosely led by the separatist Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN) movement in the three southernmost provinces. So are the arson attacks we are also now hearing about, last night. Even the Thai police chief, Gen Chakthip Chaijinda, has now acknowledged a possible link to the deep south.If this turns out to be the case, it would mark a significant escalation of the BRN's operations. The southern insurgency has continued for 12 years and killed more than 6,000 people, but has rarely spread outside the three Malay-Muslim provinces, and almost never targeted Thailand's many tourist hotspots. Targeting a royal town, Hua Hin, the favoured retreat of the royal family, and on a day when many Thais are celebrating Queen Sirikit's 84th birthday, is also significant. Whoever carried out these attacks, they surely intended to send a message, shaking public confidence in the military's ability to maintain peace and order."

The mural, which features Buddhist images, will celebrate the Thai heritage of Leicester City's owners.The Foxes stunned the Premier League by winning the title by 10 points in May. Councillor Ted Cassidy said: ""The committee took into account the objections and views of Historic England and decided that on balance, this was acceptable for that particular part of the building. ""It may in fact encourage people to go to that side."" Three murals have already been painted on to walls in the city to celebrate the title win. Historic England had hoped the council would find a ""less sensitive"" building for the latest mural to be painted. It also suggested the work could be painted on free-standing boards so it could be moved around. ""Only 8% of all listed buildings are Grade II*, making this a particularly important site,"" a spokesperson for Historic England said. ""It dates back to the early 16th Century and much of its medieval core survives, with later changes made in the 18th Century.""It is an intriguing, attractive building which reflects the rich historical and architectural importance of this area of Leicester."" The council now has three years in which to start work on the mural. "
798,Thailand approves plans to track tourists' phones,"Thailand is considering requiring tourists to use special Sim cards that would allow authorities to track their mobile phones.The plans have been approved in principle by Thailand's telecommunications regulator, which denies it is an invasion of privacy.The body says it is intended to catch those who overstay their visa.More than 19 million foreigners have visited Thailand this year, says Thailand's Tourism and Sports Ministry.The National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) said the special Sim cards would come with tracking enabled, which the user could not turn off. As well as visa overstayers, it said it could also be used to find those on the run from police. But it said authorities would need a court order to track a phone.While the proposal has been approved by the NBTC, Secretary General Takorn Tantasith said the organisation would consult with police, tourism authorities and tour operators before deciding whether to implement it.He added that foreigners working in Thailand would not be required to use the special Sim cards, although some local reports have quoted him saying they would.The proposal has been backed by other parts of Thailand's military government.""It will be helpful, if any foreigner comes and commit crimes, because in the past they have been able to flee or it can be difficult to find them,"" said Pongsathorn Chansri, an official in the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security."
799,Thai referendum: Why Thais backed a military-backed constitution,"The result of the referendum on Thailand's new constitution has left many observers around the world baffled. Why would an electorate, denied any say over who governs them since a coup two years ago, vote to approve a charter which offers them only a semi-democracy? A charter which was condemned by human rights groups and by the two largest political parties as a means to entrench military rule for many years to come?Unofficial results of the referendum showed more than 61% of those who voted approved the charter. More than 58% also approved a controversial second proposal to give the now unelected Senate to right to help choose a potentially unelected prime minister. Turnout was low at around 54%. But it was enough to give the military government, which has been losing popularity because of its erratic performance, a green light to implement its controlled return to a democratic form of governance.Many factors have been cited for the result. The repressive climate that preceded it is one. All campaigning was banned, and dozens of activists who tried to criticise the constitution were detained and charged. That meant that very few Thais were exposed to arguments about the charter's flaws and merits: few even saw a copy, and those that did were hardly likely to wade through its 279 articles. So most voters went to the polling stations with little idea what was in the charter. They had frequently heard the drafters' argument that it would address political corruption and help reform the country. But it was very difficult to hear an opposing view.Some people believed in the military's project to restore a guided democracy. Others trusted the generals to do the right thing. But many voters were simply weary of Thailand's endless crisis, and saw this constitution as the only way back to some kind of normality. The military had not said exactly what would happen if the charter was rejected, but made it clear they would remain in charge.""This is not the standard of democracy we would expect in this day and age"", Abhisit Vejjajiva, leader of the second largest party, the Democrats, told the BBC, ""but I respect the wishes of the people who voted"".The first task now of the Constitutional Drafting Committee is to draw up ten so-called organic laws, which will govern the new political system. No one is sure yet what will be in these laws, but the established political parties fear one may require them all to dissolve themselves, and reform, possibly leading to fragmentation into smaller parties. The new proportional voting system will in any case make it harder for the larger parties to win an overall majority, resulting in weaker coalition administrations.Once those laws are completed, ideally within eight months, an election can be held as early as the latter part of next year.After a new government is elected, it will find itself subject to supervision by the 250-seat Senate, which will be appointed by the military and its allies.It will also be held more tightly to account by other so-called constitutional bodies, like the top courts. Impeachment of politicians will become easier. And there is every possibility a non-MP may become prime minister, given the likelihood of deadlock in multi-party coalitions; some even see this as a vehicle for the coup-maker General Prayuth to stay in the job as prime minister in the first elected government. Future governments will also be required to adhere to the military's own 20-year reform plan for the country.The military will remain a significant force in Thai politics for many more years.The obvious loser in this system is the party of ousted Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, Phuea Thai, which, under different names, has won every election since 2001. The new voting system is likely to cost it 10-20% of the seats it has won in the past, and Ms Yingluck, the party's best vote-winner, has been banned from office for five years by the current military-appointed assembly. Her brother Thaksin lives in self-imposed exile, after being convicted of abusing his power in 2008. Even if Phuea Thai, or a reformed version of it, wins a plurality of the votes, the other parties could be organised, perhaps with quiet military involvement, as happened in 2008, into a coalition that denies it a mandate. Thailand's military rulers have made no secret of their dislike of the Shinawatra clan, and it is hard not to see this constitution as primarily concerned to keep them out of office.Overshadowing all these developments is the poor health of the ageing King Bhumibol Adulyadej. This is a taboo topic in Thailand, but everyone here knows they will have to confront a future without the king soon. During his 70 years on the throne, the king has been elevated to such an exalted status in the Thai hierarchy that he has become the essential source of authority for all power-brokers, the ultimate referee. His eventual passing, and the accession of a far less popular son, will shake up the network of military officers, senior bureaucrats, tycoons and courtiers who currently wield influence at the top, with unpredictable consequences for Thailand's political stability.The armed forces pride themselves on being, above anything else, defenders of the monarchy. They will not let go until the difficult succession has been completed."
800,Thai referendum: Military-written constitution approved,"A clear majority of Thai referendum voters have backed a draft constitution written by an army-appointed committee.Unofficial tallies show that 61.45% voted in favour.The military threw out the old constitution when it took power in 2014, after months of political instability and sporadic violence.Supporters of the new document say it will restore stability, but critics say it will entrench military control.Voters also supported a second measure on the ballot, which proposes that the appointed senate should be involved in selecting a prime minister.Turnout was about 55%, the election commission said - well below its target figure of 80%.  Campaigning against the draft in the run-up to the referendum was banned and dozens of people were detained. Thailand's biggest political parties rejected the constitution.About 200,000 police officers were deployed to maintain order and there were no reports of protests.Independent observer groups had requested accreditation to monitor the vote, but this was not granted by the election commission.The military government took a gamble in holding this referendum. Its performance in the two years since it seized power has been muddled, the economy is in poor shape and the government it ousted was led by a popular party which had won every election held in the past 15 years.The gamble paid off. Despite strong warnings from human rights groups and prominent politicians about the undemocratic character of the new constitution, a clear majority of those who voted approved it. But turnout was low, and the repressive climate which preceded the referendum, when campaigning against the charter was banned, will undermine the legitimacy of the result for many Thais. The military now plans to hold a general election by the end of next year. Under the new voting system, this is likely to produce a weak coalition administration. And a wholly-appointed Senate and other unelected bodies will be given a decisive say over Thai politics, in what might best be described as a guided democracy.Follow Jonathan Head on TwitterThe 50 million eligible voters were asked to answer yes or no to the question: Do you accept the draft constitution? They were also asked a supplementary question, whether or not the appointed senate should be allowed to join the lower house in selecting a prime minister.The draft will now become the constitution, enhancing the military government's legitimacy in the run-up to an election which Mr Prayuth, who led the 2014 coup, has promised will happen next year.The military argues that corrupt politicians are to blame for the last decade of instability and divisive politics.Made public in March, the draft proposes a voting system which would make it difficult for a single political party to win a majority of seats in the lower house.One of the most controversial clauses calls for the 250-seat senate to be fully appointed by the military government.Before the coup, just over half of the upper house seats were directly elected and the rest were appointed.The change means military-appointed lawmakers will have a decisive say in the likely event that no party holds a majority in the lower house, or National Assembly of Thailand.Thailand has had more than a decade of fractured politics and instability that has sometimes spilled over into violence.In this time, parties linked to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra have won every election, but their governments have all been ousted either by court rulings or military coups.Mr Thaksin fled into self-imposed exile in 2008 to escape a criminal charge of abusing his power, for which he was later convicted in absentia.His sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, became prime minister in 2011 but was forced to resign by the Constitutional Court just days before the military took power. She was banned from politics for five years in January 2015 after a military-appointed court found her guilty of mismanaging a rice scheme.""I'm happy that I could still exercise my rights as a [Thai] person,"" she said, after voting on Sunday."

803,Thai activists charged over 'military torture' report,"Three Thai human rights activists have been charged with criminal defamation over a report alleging torture by soldiers in southern Thailand.Allegations of military abuses in the south, home to a longstanding Muslim insurgency are nothing new.But there has been a sharp increase in the use of criminal defamation laws against government critics in recent years, BBC correspondent Jonathan Head says.Rights groups condemned the charges.The trio face up to two years in prison if found guilty of defaming the military, and a further three years if they are found to have violated the country's computer crimes act.Pornpen Khongkachonkiet, Anchana Heemmina and Somchai Homlaor published a lengthy report in February based on accounts from 54 people who had allegedly been tortured while in military detention.The torture methods alleged included sensory deprivation, physical violence, threats at gunpoint and ""partial suffocation"".Army officers, who denied the claims were true, had demanded the report's sources be named. The researchers refused, citing safety concerns.Amnesty International secretary general Salil Shetty said the charges made a mockery of the Thai government's pledge to introduce anti-torture legislation.""It is a cruel paradox that they are harassing activists for exposing the abhorrent practice,"" he said in a statement.Pornpen Khongkachonkiet serves as the chairperson of Amnesty International in Thailand.Last year, a court acquitted a Thai and an Australian journalist of similar charges after they had reprinted a news report alleging complicity between the Thai military and human traffickers.More than 6,500 people have been killed in the southern insurgency since 2004, with bombings, beheadings, shootings and assassinations common.

804,What's the point of Asean?,"Fourteen years after they first began discussing their differences with China over the South China Sea, the 10 members of Asean - the Association of Southeast Asian Nations - have once again bowed to pressure and produced a watered-down joint statement at their summit, in Laos. No mention of China, which has been creating ""facts"" in the sea by building islands on disputed reefs. No mention of the recent ruling at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague that China had no historic rights over the area.Once again, it was the smaller Asean members under China's thumb - Cambodia, and host-nation Laos - that were the weak link in the bloc's efforts to stand up to its giant neighbour.Asean avoids criticising China over seaAnd so, once again, the question pops up: what is the point of an Asean so crippled by its consensus-based decision-making that it rarely makes any decisions at all?Many years ago I put this question to Singapore's then-trade minister George Yeo. He suggested I look not so much at what Asean had achieved, as what it had prevented. An impoverished, war-torn region caught up in the hottest of Cold War conflicts was, he said, turned into a zone of peace and prosperity. By diffusing disputes through the ""Asean Way"" of meetings, seeking consensus and forswearing any interference in one another's internal affairs, the economies of South East Asia were able to tap into the global supply chain and start their impressive growth.Founded in 1967 by Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines Later expanded to include Brunei, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and MyanmarPurpose is to promote co-operation and collaboration between member states, peace and stability, economic integration and growth, and an ""Asean Community""Works on principles of consultation and consensus, non-interference, non-confrontation and the peaceful settlement of disputes Asean Secretariat is based in Jakarta, IndonesiaAsean's proudest achievements are its role in ending the Cambodian civil war and bringing the three Indochinese countries into its fold in the 1990s, and its patience, in the face of Western criticism, with Myanmar's military leaders as they shuffled in the direction of democratic reform.But the association's weaknesses have been cruelly exposed by China. There is no mechanism to ensure solidarity in Asean, just a seemingly endless series of meetings - more than 1,000 every year - in which backroom diplomacy can undo a hard-won consensus decision in minutes. The Asean secretariat, with just over 300 staff, is hopelessly under-resourced just to manage the logistics of these constant get-togethers. There are no Asean institutions to rival the EU's Commission. Council of Ministers and Court of Justice. The so-called Asean Economic Community, launched with great fanfare in Malaysia last year, is little more than a set of distant aspirations.Asean also lacks leaders of the stature of its founding fathers to drive the bloc forward. Indonesia, traditionally the weightiest power in the bloc, no longer wields the kind of clout its long-standing former foreign minister Ali Alatas did in the 1980s and 1990s. There is no-one now to match the charisma of Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew and Malaysia's Mahathir Mohamad.Its supporters often cite Asean's usefulness as a forum that brings regional powers together, like the East Asia Summit, and the Asean Regional Forum which are attended by leaders and foreign ministers of countries as diverse as the US, Russia, India, China, Japan, Australia and North Korea. It is true there is nothing else quite like these gatherings and, although they invariably produce bland and non-committal joint statements, they do offer unique opportunities for otherwise impossible bilateral meetings.I recall the excitement in Brunei in 2002 when, in the aftermath of President George W Bush's ""Axis of Evil"" speech, we heard that Secretary of State Colin Powell had met his North Korean counterpart over a cup of coffee. It turned out, though, that with the complications of translation, they never went much beyond some innocuous pleasantries.But the truth of these big meetings is they end up eclipsing Asean itself. It's a bit like holding a party, inviting a group of super-celebrities, and then finding that the stars only talk among themselves. In a region confronted by growing tension among the powers on its borders, and challenges like climate change, it is no longer enough for Asean to be the mere talking shop it has been content to be for so long."
805,"Thai police interrogate girls, 8, for tearing voters lists","Thai police have summoned two eight-year old girls for questioning after they tore voters lists prepared for the upcoming constitutional referendum.The girls said they had torn the papers for fun while playing with them.Police initially said they would be charged with ""destroying assets"", but later said they would not be charged. Thailand's military government has outlawed any attempt to campaign against its controversial draft constitution, to be voted on in August.Critics say the draft constitution, if approved, would significantly weaken the power of any future elected government.  The incident began on 18 July at a school in central Kamphaeng Phet province, which was being prepared as a polling station ahead of the referendum.The girls tore some of the voters lists hung out at the school ahead of the poll, and were subsequently taken to a local police station for questioning, in the presence of child welfare staff and lawyers. The girls told officers that they had played with the lists because they were pink and a pretty colour. However, police initially said they needed to follow procedure and charge the girls, as damage to state assets had occurred, sparking anger on Thai social media and amongst rights groups.On Friday, an officer at Kamphaeng Phet police station told BBC Thai that the two girls would not be charged because they had not intended to destroy the papers for anything other than for fun, and because they were under 10 years old - the minimum age at which a person can be held legally responsible under Thai law.The girls were now back with their parents, and the police were working to conclude the case, he said.How Thailand's military uses 'attitude adjustment' for dissentersIs Thailand's battle against corruption working?Although the girls were not charged in this case, correspondents say Thailand's constitutional referendum is a sensitive subject, with over 100 people detained for expressing their opposition to the constitution. People have been arrested for carrying booklets providing information on the constitution, or criticising the draft constitution on Facebook.There have also been reports of several incidents of voters lists being meddled with. The Bangkok Post reported that lists had been tampered with at 10 polling stations in the run up to the referendum.In one case a petrol station manager admitted stealing a list because he wanted to find new clients, the Post said.

806,Thai police question British author's wife,"Thai police have questioned the wife of a Scottish journalist, hours after he shared images of the crown prince on social media.Andrew MacGregor Marshall said about 20 police officers confiscated ""evidence"" at his wife's family home in Bangkok.His wife was asked to go to the police station but not charged with any crime.The military, which took power in 2014, has increasingly enforced strict and wide-ranging lese majeste laws which forbid any criticism of the monarchy.Mr Marshall, who is currently not in Thailand, is the author of A Kingdom in Crisis which is banned in Thailand.He recently shared what purported to be unflattering photographs of Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, 63, which were originally published by German tabloid Bild.He also wrote a lengthy post speculating on the royal succession, discussion of which is also prohibited under the lese majeste laws.The widely loved and revered Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej is in frail health.On Friday, Mr Marshall said on Facebook his wife Noppawan ""Ploy"" Bunluesilp, who is a Thai citizen, was visiting Bangkok with their three-year-old son.He said she was formerly a journalist for Reuters and NBC but currently not working. ""My wife and her family are not involved in my journalism and they should not be harassed by the Thai authorities.""He posted pictures of the items he said were confiscated by police which included passports, an iPad, and iPhone and a flash drive."
807,The Thai women bucking the global trend,"Wandee Khunchornyakong doesn't fit the usual stereotype of a start-up founder.At 60 years old, she's much older than your typical budding entrepreneur.Yet in her home country of Thailand she was the first person willing to take a chance on an industry still in its infancy - solar power.In fact, she was so convinced of the sector's potential that she came out of retirement to set up her own company.Thailand, forced to shift away from once-plentiful natural gas reserves, was for the first time ever  offering to buy back solar power from private firms.With enough free time to look into the numbers, and having previously had some experience in the use of solar energy in rural areas, Ms Khunchornyakong felt instinctively that the sector offered a compelling opportunity.Yet when she started trying to fund her first solar project, not a single bank was willing to lend her the money, as none of them believed it could be a profitable business.In frustration she issued an ultimatum to a Thai bank that sported a green logo to indicate support of environmental projects. She insisted that if the bank was not willing to lend her the money it would have to change the colour of its logo.""He really didn't want to change the colour of the bank so he agreed to start talking. That's the way I can convince the management to at least listen.""Eventually the bank gave her a loan for 60% of the start-up costs, leaving her to find the other 40%.The newness of solar power in the country meant none of her friends who had invested in her previous business ventures were willing to lend her money so she was forced to use her house as collateral to provide the initial equity to get the business off the ground.Once the first project proved successful she had a real-life example of how the business worked and the potential profits, helping her secure the help of the World Bank to get further funding to rapidly expand.Ms Khunchornyakong is now chief executive and chairwoman of the largest solar power firm in Thailand, SPCG. The company she founded has created thousands of jobs and runs 36 solar farms, generating some 260 megawatts of solar power a year.But what on earth made her take on such a risk when she was comfortably retired?She says it was simply her conviction that the business was a good idea.""You have to believe in your own thinking and if you don't believe your own thinking who else will believe you?""It's a lesson she believes anyone, particularly women, can learn from, noting too many are afraid to take a public risk.Yet in Thailand it seems many women already do. Senior successful high-flying women like Ms Khunchornyakong are far more common than in many other places in the world.In fact, almost a third of senior business roles in the country are held by females, according to accountancy firm Grant Thornton's recent study.The report puts Thailand well above its developed rivals such as the UK, US and Australia in which around a fifth of senior business roles are held by women.Chadatip Chutrakul, another female Thai chief executive who runs Siam Piwat, a huge shopping mall and real estate enterprise in Thailand, says that historically the country has long treated women and men equally.""Five hundred years ago we also saved the country together with the men. So that is how it has been carried on.""If you have good education and if you can prove yourself in everything that you do then there is no limitation. You can move forward in your career.""Ho Ren Hua, chief executive of Thai Wah Group, a large food products business with operations across Asia, also credits the country's historical roots for its higher level of equality in business compared to many other countries. He notes that Thailand has long had strong, assertive females, and that many Thai men are therefore comfortable reporting to a female supervisor.""I think there are strong principles on mutual respect, and maybe it translates to the fundamental history of Thailand with the role of Buddhism and the role of the monarchy that there's a big adherence to mutual respect.""It's a level of equality that firms in other countries are now trying to copy.Ahmed Fahour, boss of Australia Post, has made a big effort to improve the number of senior women at the firm since he took the helm in 2010.Like many postal services that have seen the number of letters sent decline sharply as people use email instead, the biggest part of its business is now parcels driven by online shopping.With 70% of online purchases made by women he says having more females in senior positions isn't just about fairness, it makes business sense.""Having a bunch of blokes is not really a smart idea. It is pathetic that we are in the year 2016 and we are having this conversation when there is roughly 50% women, 50% men, and at the same time that is not reflected in the leadership of major corporations.""There is already a whole host of research to support Mr Fahour's view. Newswire Thomson Reuters found a strong link between mixed gender boards and a better performance for shareholders when it analysed boardroom diversity at 4,100 listed firms and measured their performance between 2008 and 2013.And Swiss bank Credit Suisse, which looked at the performance of 3,000 companies around the world, concluded that those businesses with at least one woman on the board outperformed those with no women by an average of 2% a year between 2012 and 2014.When Mr Fahour started at the firm just 19% of management positions were held by women. Now it's 37%.""We decided talking about it is not good enough,"" he says. ""Just do it.""This feature is based on interviews by CEO coach and author Steve Tappin for the BBC's CEO Guru series, produced by Neil Koenig."

810,Starting a business in the middle of a coup,"Trying to start a new business is tough. There are the long hours as you try to get it off the ground, the difficulties of trying to find enough money to fund it and then you have to convince customers to trust you.But how about trying to establish a new firm in the midst of a coup? In a game of Top Trumps over who's had it hardest, Paul Srivorakul, founder and chief executive of aCommerce, would have an unbeatable hand.He started his online retail logistics firm in 2013 in the midst of a period of dramatic instability in the country of his birth, Thailand. After months of political turmoil, the country's military seized control of the government and suspended the constitution.The firm's Bangkok office was based near the very centre of the troubles in Lumpini Park, making for a terrifying start.""It was very scary. We had bullet holes here. The coup was actually happening in Lumpini Park and we could see that from here and that was very challenging.""Despite the dangers, Mr Srivorakul decided to persevere with setting up the company, a gamble which paid off.In fact, the company actually benefited from the precarious situation.""People stayed at home. They didn't go out and shop. Therefore they did more e-commerce,"" he says.  Of course the troubles and their impact on Thailand weren't a good thing overall, he is quick to add.And while the business appeared to be unusually resilient, Mr Srivorakul says the experience taught him the importance of not being dependent on just one area, particularly in a developing country where arguably the risks can be higher.The firm now operates not just in Thailand, but also in other south-east Asian countries including the Philippines, Singapore and Indonesia.Its business too is diverse, with the broad aim of helping online retailers reach their customers, it does marketing and website building, as well as supply chain and logistics.""We diversify by having other markets as well. So when there's an issue in one market, you minimise that risk,"" Mr Srivorakul says.It's something that Wasna Rungsanthong, chief executive of Narai Intertrade, a chain of shops which makes the Naraya range of bags and has a chain of shops selling a variety of goods from handbags to kitchenware, knows well.The firm, which she set up with her husband, now has 23 shops in Thailand and 14 in other countries.Nonetheless the ongoing uncertainty in Thailand, which has had a staggering 12 military coups since 1932, more than any other country in modern history, still affects sales.For her, one of the main risks is losing good staff during the turmoil. At the height of the recent troubles, the firm had no customers and as a result no work for their factories.But it didn't make a single staff member redundant, instead continuing to employ and pay all 4,000 employees.The loyalty shown by the firm to the staff meant they in turn were keen to help in keeping costs down. Little things such as remembering to turn off the lights, for example, and refusing to take additional payments for costs such as food and petrol helped to keep the firm's finances on an even keel.""We will not make our staff afraid. If we can solve any problem we will do,"" she says.For some businesses based in a sometimes unstable country, it's not just a matter of survival, but an opportunity to try and gain a competitive advantage.Siam Piwat, a huge shopping mall and real estate enterprise in Thailand, has a policy of actively trying to invest and expand whenever there's turmoil in the country.One of its properties is the vast Siam Paragon mall, one of the most talked about places on Facebook last year.While it may seem counter-intuitive, chief executive Chadatip Chutrakul says it makes sense because it's the cheapest time to do so.""All the construction costs will go down, and you know when we build it will take at least two or three years to complete. So by that time hopefully the economy would catch up, which it did every time.""In fact, despite the country's difficulties, growth in Thailand remains relatively robust. Gross domestic product grew 3.2% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2016, up unexpectedly from the previous quarter's 2.8% growth and despite significant exposure to China's slowing economy.Ho Ren Hua, chief executive of Thai Wah Group, a large food products business with operations across Asia, credits Thailand's private companies for helping drive this growth.He says the fact that they have largely continued as normal has helped drive the economy forward, while the ongoing volatility has forced firms to become more efficient.""I think the role of the private sector to continue to help deliver economic growth, innovating new jobs and services, it's increasingly important, for the future of Thailand.""Chief executive coach Steve Tappin says that while all business leaders hate an uncertain environment, there's a lot that global business leaders can learn from how Thai bosses have handled it.""Thailand is by far the only place where uncertainty is a big challenge - it's an issue that businesses everywhere are going have to get used to dealing with.""This feature is based on interviews by CEO coach and author Steve Tappin for the BBC's CEO Guru series, produced by Neil Koenig."

814,Thailand: Devotees block arrest of Dhammakaya temple abbot,"Thousands of supporters of an influential Thai Buddhist abbot have blocked his arrest in a police raid.Phra Dhammajayo is accused of money laundering and embezzling funds from the huge Dhammakaya temple in Bangkok.But his supporters blocked officers from searching parts of the compound.The 72-year-old abbot has stayed inside the temple for months, saying he is too ill to face officials. He denies the allegations and says they are politically motivated. In a statement, the devotees of the temple said Phra Dhammajayo was severely ill and would enter the judicial process only when the country returned to democracy.Thailand has been run by the military since a coup in 2014.Police say they have paused an operation to arrest Phra Dhammajayo after devotees blocked their way.A temple spokesman said monks were co-operating with police, but could not stop some followers from acting. However, Suriya Singhakamol, deputy chief of the police department of special investigations, said: ""Our operation has not ended. The [arrest] warrant is still valid so we will have authority to carry out the operation. According to our information, he is still inside.""One 58-year-old female supporter told Reuters: ""Arresting him is uncalled for. It's not like he killed someone.""The raid is the latest flashpoint between secular authorities and Buddhists in Thailand, and follows a raid on the controversial Tiger Temple.Analysts say police do not want to appear confrontational towards Buddhist monks or enter a temple by force, given their revered status in Thailand.Police said they had delayed Thursday's raid against the Dhammakaya temple in northern Bangkok until the monks had finished their lunch - their only meal of the day.Founded in the 1970s, the temple contrasts starkly with the informal, tradition-bound character of most Thai temples, which are often integrated into the local community. It has more of the character of a charismatic cult, offering tightly choreographed mass meditations at its bizarre, flying saucer-like central chedi, and encouraging intense loyalty from its followers. Partly it is due to its size, the devotion of its followers, and its unusual interpretation of Buddhist practice. It has proved very attractive in a fast-changing society, and become wealthy on the back of generous donations. Critics have accused it of distorting the traditional teachings of Buddhism, and taking followers away from local temples.Wat Dhammakaya is controversial for another reason too - its alleged close links to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and the red shirt movement which supports him. They deny the Thaksin links. They say the temple attracts Thais from all walks of life and all political persuasions. But in Thailand's polarised political climate, such a powerful religious sect has inevitably been drawn in, with opponents of Mr Thaksin and his party making the loudest calls for action against the temple's abbot.The potential for huge numbers of the temple's followers to be mobilised in mass protests must also weigh on the minds of a military government obsessed with maintaining tight control of the country as it navigates a difficult political transition."
815,Thailand's King Bhumibol marks 70 years on the throne,"Thailand has been marking 70 years since King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest-reigning living monarch, ascended to the throne. The celebrations began with a religious ceremony in Bangkok, led by 770 Buddhist monks, an auspicious number. The 88-year-old king is revered by Thais, for whom he has been a figure of stability through the country's decades of political upheaval.But he is in poor health and has not been seen in public for months.Profile: King Bhumibol AdulyadejOn Tuesday, he had heart surgery, with what the palace said were ""satisfactory results"".The procedure, known as balloon surgery, was to widen his arteries after tests showed he had insufficient blood in the heart muscles, the statement said. The king has spent much of the past few years in hospital, and his health is closely watched by Thais.""The relationship between Thais and the King is deep, more than one can actually begin to explain,"" Col Winthai Suvaree, a spokesman for the royalist junta, said to Reuters. ""He is a father to the land.""Several hundred people gathered outside the palace on Thursday morning to wish the king well.As expected, he did not make a public appearance. ""I want to make merit for the king to encourage him to have good health. That's how I can show loyalty to him even though he can't see it, that's fine,"" 68-year-old Bangkok resident Chonmanee Smativat told AFP.""I want him to know that we all love him. He has worked hard for Thais. Since I was little I have seen how hard he works.""The king's popularity stems partly from his long reign and service to Thai people, but also because he is seen as an arbiter in politics.  Thailand has been wracked by political strife in recent years and is currently governed by a military-led government.Strict lese majeste laws ban any criticism of the king or the royal family."

""She had become a British subject after passing her citizenship test with flying colours.""The pair had been touring Thailand before the accident unfolded, as the boat made its way back to Koh Samui from Mu Ko Ang Thong National Park.Another Briton, Jason Parnell, also died.""We had heard so may good things about the country from friends and family,"" Mr O'Connor continued.The couple, who had been together for three-and-a-half years, met at accountancy firm Deloitte in Manchester, where Mrs O'Connor had risen to be a manager.They later married in the city.""She was involved in training but always wanted to help people anyway,"" Mr O'Connor said.  Animals were Ms O'Connor's great passion, he said, especially the couple's Chow Chow dogs Jasper and Simba. She had even considered having their wedding at Chester Zoo.""She had always wanted to a zoo keeper but she didn't have the right degree.""Mr O'Connor, who was too distressed to talk about the accident itself, recalled how delighted she was to visit Elephant Hills jungle camp, an ethically-run sanctuary for elephants.But he said she had also been ""very upset"" about the conditions at another animal reserve in the country.""She had written an email of complaint on my laptop which we were going to send when we returned home,"" he said.Her father-in-law, John O'Connor, said her love for animals had actually extended to the couple's wedding ceremony.""She wanted one of her dogs to bring the ring up, I thought she was joking but it happened,"" he said.""She also said she wanted her normal blonde hair dyed the same colour as one of the dogs, and she showed a photo to her hairdresser.""The boat was carrying 32 passengers and four crew when it capsized, although police said it was licensed to carry 45 passengers, so it was not overcrowded.The sea was reportedly rough at the time of the accident, which occurred just 300 metres from the shore.Seven people were taken to hospital with serious injuries.Mrs O'Connor's body was returned to Britain last week."

820,Four men jailed for Thai street attack on Wenvoe family,"Four men who attacked a south Wales family in Thailand have been jailed, it has been reported. Rosemary and Lewis Owen, of Wenvoe, Vale of Glamorgan, were on holiday with their son, John, in Hua Hin when the attack happened in April.Mrs Owen, 65, needed surgery to remove fluid from the brain after the attack. On Sunday, she said the Foreign Office had confirmed the men had each been jailed for four years.   News of their sentences was reported in the Bangkok Post. Suphatra Baithong and Yingyai Saengkham-in, both aged 32, and Siwa Noksri and Chaiya Jaiboon, both 20, were each sentenced to four years in prison.But their jail terms were halved because they had confessed, meaning each man will serve two years.Footage of the assault captured on CCTV was widely shared online in Thailand and drew international attention to the attack.Thai police said it started after John Owen accidentally bumped into a Thai man in the street during celebrations for the Thai New Year.Footage showed a brief argument taking place before attackers punched and kicked the Owens.Mr Owen, 68, a director at Glamorgan Electrical Repairs in Cardiff, and John Owen, 43, a graphic designer who lives in Singapore, both needed stitches for head injuries following the assault on 13 April.After the attack Panadda Diskul, a minister in the Thai prime minister's office, visited Mr and Mrs Owen in hospital where he was reported to have apologised on behalf of the Thai government.

822,Thailand Tiger Temple operation 'is completed',"A week-long operation to remove nearly 140 tigers from a temple in Thailand has finished, officials say.Operators at Wat Pha Luang Ta Bua temple, known as the Tiger Temple, are accused of wildlife trafficking and animal abuse. They deny the charges.On Wednesday, wildlife officials found the bodies of 40 dead tiger cubs at the temple complex west of Bangkok.The temple has been accused by experts of not keeping the animals properly and illegal trade in tiger parts.Body parts found at the temple have increased suspicions that it is run as an admission-charging zoo while engaging in unethical breeding and trafficking of endangered animals. Tiger Temple's long history of controversyBBC visit to the Tiger Temple in 2012The Buddhist temple first started taking in tigers nearly 20 years ago and since then has developed into a big and profitable tourist attraction.Wildlife activists have accused the temple of illegally breeding tigers while online commentators have complained that the animals seem to be sedated.The temple denies these accusations.Department of National Parks spokesman Adisorn Nuchdamrong told the Reuters news agency that 22 people had been charged with wildlife possession and trafficking, including 17 members of the temple's foundation and three monks caught trying to flee with a truckload of tiger skins on Thursday.It followed the discovery of the 40 dead tiger cubs inside a freezer.Correspondents say it is not clear why the dead cubs were being stored.  Tiger bones and body parts are used in traditional Chinese medicine.""We've confiscated all the hard disks of closed circuit cameras in this temple for police to find evidence of wrongdoing,"" Mr Adisorn said.The temple officially opened in 1994 near a wild tiger habitat. Its first cub was found by villagers in 1999. Since then they have continued to bring cubs to the temple, especially when their mothers are killed by poachers.Monks have prevented frequent moves to close it.Thailand is a renowned centre of trafficking of illicit wildlife products, including ivory. The wildlife department first raided the temple on Monday. Most of the 137 tigers inside the complex have now been removed."
823,Thailand Tiger Temple monk held 'for smuggling',"Thai authorities say they have detained a monk attempting to smuggle tiger skins and fangs from a Buddhist temple.Operators at Wat Pha Luang Ta Bua temple, known as the ""Tiger Temple"", are accused of wildlife trafficking and animal abuse. They deny the charges.On Wednesday, wildlife officials found the bodies of 40 dead tiger cubs at the temple complex.The discovery came during a week-long effort to relocate 137 tigers from the tourist site in Kanchanaburi province.The temple operators had resisted previous attempts to remove the tigers. Tiger Temple's long history of controversyBBC visit to the Tiger Temple in 2012Police intercepted the monk, and two other men, in a lorry leaving the temple in western Thailand on Thursday.The authorities confiscated two full-length tiger skins, about 700 amulets made from tiger parts, and 10 tiger fangs, Teunchai Noochdumrong, director of of the Wildlife Conservation Office, told the BBC.""This confiscation shows that the temple is likely involved in illegal tiger trade. They are clearly violating the law in selling, distributing of transferring the protected animals or their parts,"" she said.Wildlife authorities in Thailand have said they will press charges against the temple.On Wednesday, tiger cub corpses were found in a freezer at the complex, along with body parts from other animals.Police Col Bandith Meungsukhum told the Agence France-Presse news agency the cubs would have been one or two days old, but it was not clear how long they had been dead. They will be DNA tested to see whether they were related to other tigers at the site.Officials say the temple operators could be charged with keeping the carcasses without permission.The temple previously said it had decided in 2010 to stop cremating cubs which died soon after birth. It has always denied trafficking allegations.Authorities started the operation to remove all 137 living tigers from the temple on Monday. Dozens have already been removed, and taken to animal refuges.The site, west of Bangkok, is a popular tourist attraction, with visitors able to pose for photos with the animals for a fee.It has been closed to the public since the raid.Animal activists and former workers have claimed the tigers are mistreated and kept in small concrete cages.

824,Thailand Tiger Temple: Forty dead cubs found in freezer,"Forty dead tiger cubs have been found in a freezer at a Thai Buddhist temple accused of wildlife trafficking and animal abuse.Police and wildlife officials started an operation on Monday to remove all the living tigers at the Tiger Temple.Pictures from journalists at the scene posted to social media showed the 40 cubs lined up on the floor.The site in Kanchanaburi is a popular tourist attraction but has been closed to the public since the raid.Temple's long history of controversyPolice Colonel Bandith Meungsukhum told AFP news agency that wildlife officials would file new criminal charges after the discovery, and added that the cubs were just one or two days old when they died.  He said it was not yet clear how long they had been dead.The dead cubs ""must be of some value for the temple"", Adisorn Nuchdamrong, from Thailand's Department of National Parks, told Reuters news agency. ""But for what is beyond me.""Tiger bones and body parts are used in traditional Chinese medicine.Monks at the temple were not available for comment but have previously denied trafficking allegations.In a statement on its Facebook page, the temple said the mortality rate for tiger cubs at the temple was ""comparatively low"" and that it used to cremate dead cubs but a vet changed the policy in 2010 ""probably to keep as proof against the allegations of selling cubs"".Chris Coots, an Englishman who has volunteered with the tigers, told the BBC that the remains were frozen as proof that cubs who died of natural causes were not being sold into the wildlife trade.He said: ""A number of the bodies are in a state of decay as they have been there over five years. ""It would seem strange to keep the bodies that long if the intent was to sell them. This will be easily clarified by decomposition tests.""Body parts from other animals were also found in a freezer, Tom Taylor, from Wildlife Friends Foundation,  told the BBC.A reporter from the Khaosod news website said he had seen animal intestines in containers, a dead boar and other animal parts.Dozens of living tigers have already been removed, out of 137 at the temple. The 1,000-strong police operation is due to continue all week.Some workers and volunteers at the temple spoke out against the operation.But the World Wildlife Fund welcomed the news and called on the Thai government to prohibit the temple from keeping tigers in future.Since 2001, authorities have been locked in a battle with the monks at the temple to confiscate the tigers after allegations of wildlife trafficking and abuse surfaced.The monks deny any wrongdoing.The temple, officially known as Wat Pha Luang Ta Bua, has been a stop on many tourists' itineraries for decades. Visitors could pose for photographs with the tigers or help with their exercise routine. But animal rights campaigners have long campaigned to close it down. Peta said animals there are ""imprisoned and denied everything that is important to them""."
825,Thai Tiger Temple's long history of controversy,"Thailand's Tiger Temple is causing more controversy this week as authorities move to put an end to the popular tourist attraction. As the BBC explains, the temple has long been shrouded in allegations of animal abuse and trafficking. What is the 'Tiger Temple'?Tiger Temple, also known as Wat Pha Luang Ta Bu Yannasampanno, is located in Thailand's Kanchanaburi Province, west of Bangkok. It received its first tiger cub in 1999 and an additional seven more in the same year. The temple was recorded to have at least 137 tigers in 2016. The majority of the tigers are Bengal tigers, with others being hybrid breeds. There are also reports of jackals, hornbills and Asian bears being kept in the sanctuary without the necessary permits. Visitors are charged 600 Thai Baht ($16, £11) for entry into the temple, with additional costs to pet or feed the tigers. And thousands of people flock to it every year to have their pictures taken with the animals.There are other places in Thailand that also charge a fee to have close encounters with tigers, but this is the biggest and most popular with tourists by far, according to the Wildlife Friends Foundation of Thailand (WFFT), a non-governmental organisation (NGO) that has actively been campaigning for the release of the tigers since 2004.What is the controversy?Buddhist monks who run the temple have long faced accusations of mistreatment of tigers, illegal breeding and animal trafficking, all of which they have repeatedly denied.  Former workers have claimed the tigers are beaten, not well fed, in need of veterinary care and kept in small concrete cages. Earlier this year a National Geographic report alleged the monks are operating a for-profit breeding business.There is evidence to suggest that wildlife trafficking has taken place, says the WFFT, without providing specific examples.In December 2014, three adult male tigers vanished from the temple. They had been micro-chipped, a legal requirement for captive endangered animals in Thailand, which allows them to be tracked. The temple's veterinarian Somchai Visasmongkolchai later came forward after resigning from his post to say that the microchips had been cut out of the three males. What do the monks say?The temple posted on its Facebook page on 4 March that posts accusing the temple of selling cubs to the black market were ""not true"", adding that some volunteers had ""jumped to conclusions"". It added that allegations that the relocation of the tigers was due to animal welfare were ""far from the truth"". The temple has an annual income of around 100m Thai Baht ($2.8m, £1.9m), according to the WFFT. The monks have also admitted to generating ""some income"" from tiger cub activities.So why are the tigers being removed now? There has been an ongoing battle between wildlife groups and the monks since 2001.The Department of National Parks (DNP) has tried on multiple occasions to confiscate the tigers but was stopped from entering the temple by the monks.More recently, the temple applied for a zoo licence that would have enabled them to legally continue holding the animals. This was provisionally granted, but then revoked soon after. On Monday, authorities, the WFFT and other NGOs launched a large-scale raid on the tiger temple to confiscate the tigers.""The monks were at this one small entrance gate, the only gate to the temple and they were refusing entry to anyone,"" Tom Taylor, assistant director of the WFFT, who was present at the time of the raid, told the BBC.However, on Tuesday officials obtained a court order that allowed them to force their way in to the temple.How is the operation being carried out?A total of 40 tigers have been rescued within the first two day of the week-long operation, Mr Taylor said. At least 97 more tigers will be rescued in the 1,000 personnel operation. However, the temple's lack of co-operation, which saw them release the tigers off the chains so it was harder for authorities to catch them, could see the operation extended, Mr Taylor said.Four tigers also escaped overnight and started killing off other domestic animals in the premises. They were caught soon after. NGOs and authorities are also now feeding the tigers still remaining in the temple, as the monks have now refused to feed the animals, Mr Taylor said.On Wednesday,  an additional 40 dead tiger cubs were found in the temple's freezer. Additional animal body parts were also found by authorities.  What will happen to the tigers?The tigers will be transferred to two governmental breeding centres in Thailand's Ratchaburi Province. They will not be released to the wild as they would have little chance of survival.""The fact that they are hand-raised tigers means they have very little fear of humans or wildlife instincts. So at the moment, the plan is to provide them with wildlife care,"" said Mr Taylor. ""They would not be able to survive in the wild."" "
826,Yingluck Shinawatra steps back into Thailand's political arena,"When she was stripped of her job as prime minister in a controversial Constitutional Court verdict two years ago, and then, two weeks later, her government was deposed by a military coup, Yingluck Shinawatra's brief political career appeared to be over. It seemed a certainty after a military-appointed assembly banned her from political office for five years, and then a criminal charge was filed against her. For most of the past two years the telegenic sister of political heavyweight Thaksin Shinawatra has been out of the public eye.Yet in recent days she has emerged again, apparently campaigning in her party's strongholds on the north and north-east, receiving a rapturous welcome from people who believe her government improved the quality of their lives. It is not actual campaigning of course. The military junta has banned all political activity. Parties are not even allowed to hold meetings of their own members. No-one knows when an election will be held again, although the latest in a series of shifting deadlines is the end of next year.Ms Yingluck has found a way around the strictures of military rule by holding a contest among her five million Facebook followers. She asked them to name a tourist attraction in their home provinces, and had them cast votes for the top three she should visit. I accompanied her to the far north-eastern province of Bueng Kan, which lies along a bend in the Mekong River opposite Laos.I was curious, partly to see Ms Yingluck interacting with her supporters, as I was not in Thailand when she had campaigned for the 2011 election, and partly to see whether she could avoid provoking the military, which is clearly nervous of her popular appeal. In two months, Thailand will hold a national referendum on a new, military-drafted constitution, which would significantly reduce the number of seats won in the past by Ms Yinguck's party, and weaken the power of any elected government. Born 21 June 1967Youngest of nine children; elder brother is former PM Thaksin ShinawatraGraduate in political science and business administration, master's degree, Kentucky State UniversityMarried to businessman Anusorn Amornchat; has one sonFirst woman to run for the country's highest political officeUnsurprisingly her party, and others, object to a charter they see as intended to weaken democracy and extend the influence of the armed forces in politics. However the military has outlawed any attempt to campaign against the constitution, even while it is funding a nationwide effort to inform the public about the 279-article draft, which will inevitably give it a positive gloss. The people we spoke to in Bueng Kan said they knew very little about the charter, and did not appear to understand the impact it would have on their party.Yingluck Shinawatra could not say anything about the constitution without risking a 10-year prison sentence. In fact she gave no speeches at all on her one-day whirlwind tour. But perhaps she did not need to. She has not lost the skills she demonstrated during the 2011 election campaign for working a crowd, conversing and joking easily with everyone she met. She got a rock star reception at a large high school. She was hugged and garlanded with flowers by people waiting for her at the cliff-top temple, which was the official reason for her visit. She reminded her supporters that she had not gone away, and that she could still bring a bit of political glamour to their remote corner of the country. Quietly, many of them expressed their frustration over the way the military is running the country. None of this guarantees that they will vote against the constitution in the August referendum. When I asked Ms Yingluck's advisors how they would disseminate their objections to the charter, given the ban on campaigning, they said they would have to rely on word-of-mouth, through their extant but largely inactive local networks. With the junta refusing to say what it will do if the charter is rejected, some of Ms Yingluck's supporters may vote for it just to bring an end to military rule and bring back some kind of election. And with a court case carrying a possible 10-year sentence already underway against the former prime minister, her own future is unclear."

A total of three people were killed when the boat, with 32 passengers and four crew, capsized on Thursday.It was on its way back to the popular island from Mu Ko Ang Thong National Park on Ko Pha Ngan island when it apparently hit rough waters.The other victims were women from Hong Kong and Germany.

The police also say the boat was licensed to carry 45 passengers, so it was not overcrowded. Dozens of fast tour boats go out every day from the island of Koh Samui, taking tourists to snorkel and kayak in the seas of the Ang Thong National park.

832,"Bangkok bomb: Erawan shrine attacker 'is part of network', police say","The bomb attack that killed 20 people at Bangkok's Erawan shrine on Monday was carried out by a ""network"", Thailand's chief of police has said.Police have released a sketch of the main suspect, a man in a yellow T-shirt who was filmed by security cameras leaving a backpack at the shrine.Police later said two other people seen on CCTV were being treated as suspects.Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has described the incident as the worst-ever attack on Thailand.The Hindu shrine, popular with tourists and Buddhists, reopened on Wednesday.Police chief Somyot Poompanmoung told the Associated Press news agency that the shrine attack was the work of more than one person.""He didn't do it alone for sure,"" he said, referring to the main suspect. ""It's a network,"" he added, without giving further information. But he said he was certain that Thai citizens were involved in the bombing.Although the main suspect in the footage has not been identified, an arrest warrant for him has been issued by Bangkok's Southern Criminal Court. It accuses an ""unnamed foreigner"" of conspiracy to commit ""premeditated murder"" and weapons offences.Police spokesman Prawut Thawornsiri said in a TV interview that the man could be of ""mixed origin"".'A tremendous role model': The people killed in BangkokIn pictures: Worshippers return to the shrineThe facts: What we know so farWho did it? The theories behind the Thai attackTourism hit: Will travellers avoid Bangkok?A reward of one million baht ($28,000; £17,950) has been offered for information leading to his arrest.Mr Prawut also said that two other men seen in the grainy CCTV footage were being sought. ""The person in red and the person in white are also suspects,"" he said.The BBC's Steve Evans in Bangkok says the new information implies this may have been an organised international operation, perhaps with a religious motive.The prime minister urged the main suspect to surrender to the police because he might otherwise ""get killed to stop him from talking"".Mr Prayuth told reporters the man must have been hired to plant the bomb.However, our correspondent says there are indications the main suspect was driven to the airport after the attack and may well have flown.The shrine reopened at about 08:00 local time (01:00 GMT), with a handful of people arriving to place flowers or light incense in front of the slightly damaged statue of the Hindu god Brahma.A BBC reporter at the scene says there appears to be low security in place, with the public free to walk in unchecked. She says the last human remains were only cleared from the site earlier on Wednesday. Most of the victims of Monday's attack were Thai, but nationals from China, Hong Kong, the UK, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore were among the foreigners killed.No-one has yet said they carried out the attack.In a separate attack on Tuesday, an explosive device was thrown at a pier in Bangkok. No-one was hurt, but the authorities have not ruled out a link between the incidents. Maj Gen Weerachoon Sukhontapatipak, a spokesman in the military government, earlier told the BBC that the authorities were ""quite close"" to identifying the suspect caught on CCTV at the shrine.The man is seen carefully removing his backpack inside the shrine - at the spot the bomb went off - then getting up without it and immediately leaving.Gen Sukhontapatipak said no motive was being ruled out and the character of the bombing was ""quite different"" from previous attacks by Islamist separatists in southern Thailand.Speaking in a television address on Tuesday evening, Mr Prayuth said the attack showed that Thailand ""still has a person or a group of people with hostility to the nation operating actively"".""They may be doing it for a political motive or to undermine the economy or tourism or for other reasons,"" he said, according to the Bangkok Post.He also warned against speculation on possible perpetrators, saying it could cause panic or mislead the investigation."

No problem....For the past 24 years, Buddhist monk Phra Subin Paneeto has been the go-to guy for Thai people who need a loan but can't go to a bank as they have no assets a financial institution would be prepared to lend against.Phra Subin Paneeto, however, has faith in something he believes is far more powerful: the rule of karma.In the 1980s, the monk witnessed first-hand the poverty and social problems affecting Thailand's remote towns and provinces after he embarked on a country-wide pilgrimage.But it was not until 1992 that he could gather enough support to start a micro-lending operation to help local villagers in the southern province of Trad to deal with their money-related difficulties.The scheme, which combines Buddhist teachings with a community-based management method, has resulted in a micro-banking network, which today holds $63m (£43m) of deposits and loans.Borrowers take out loans for necessities such as food, clothing, medicine and home repairs. Some also seek larger sums for building houses and purchasing land for cultivation.The scheme, known as Sajja Sasom Sab, is run as a co-operative, accepting only people who live locally. Members contribute a small amount monthly.  The reason they choose to take out loans from this scheme instead of going to banks is because banks require collateral and credit history.However, borrowers, who are also depositors, pay low or even no interest when they take out the loans. There are conditions though. They have to find at least three guarantors to whom they are not related. ""I'd say to them the money in the community must not be lost; so people need to solve the problem together with the community, by the community and for the community. They can't take out the loan and not pay it back,"" Phra Subin Paneeto warns. ""So anyone who is not honest, there won't be anyone willing to be his guarantor.""He believes that this screening mechanism not only ensures that all members have their say in how the scheme should work but also helps the community to come up with its own solutions to the problems members face.""This is called the rule of karma, the joint action in the community,"" he says.His micro-lending network has spread across 40 provinces in Thailand, with similar schemes  introduced in neighbouring Laos and Myanmar.He says there have been problems in remote parts of Thailand due to ageing populations and a shortage of young, educated workers. Also, much of the countryside's population relies on the agriculture sector, which does not necessarily provide social security. Therefore any profits the scheme produces are used to take care of the elderly or the sick in the villages instead of being shared out as dividends.""I always say: do not focus on the profit but on the welfare of the people and the community instead,"" Phra Subin Paneeto explains.How social entrepreneurs are tackling the world's problems'We will give that food to someone who is hungry''If you're not honest, you can't borrow''I want to train more water warriors'Fighting back against harassers in the Middle EastBreaking transgender taboos at workSpecial Report: Changing the RulesEvery week Raeda Jaryan drives her car to see Abu Ali, the owner of a banana tree plantation in the Jordan Valley. They greet each other cheerfully, drink tea, and later, they discuss business. For the next half an hour, she will carefully choose the dried leaves that will adorn her handcrafted baskets. In Jordan, a country were most women in rural areas are meant to stay at home, with little prospect for employment, Mrs Jaryan had hoped for a better future. But Mrs Jaryan is a woman who likes to forge her own path and after taking a course on how to make baskets out of banana leaves she turned to a Microfund for Women (MFW) branch in her area asking for a loan. She impressed them and returned home with not one, but two loans. And with that money she expanded her business, employed several women in her community, and started contributing to the income of her household.During the past 20 years, about 125,000 women have benefited from MFW, a microfinance institution in Jordan focused on helping poor women with no assets to get out of poverty.The programme began as a Save the Children initiative in 1994 before operating as a local NGO called the Jordanian Women's Development Society. It went through yet another change in 1999 when it was registered as a not-for-profit limited liability company.But its success has not been the result of a smooth pathway.""Women initially came to us in secret. It was not culturally acceptable for a woman to take out a loan. Their husbands were not happy about it and they would come and say to us, 'We are going to take this loan but please can you make sure no-one knows about it,'"" says Muna Sukhtian, the chief executive of MFW.There are 54 branches across Jordan. And, surprisingly, over time it has become common practice for men to ask for a loan too. ""That shows that changes happen,"" Ms Sukhtian points out. Yet, challenges persist. Still many women in Jordan, and all over the world, have no access to financial services because they have no assets to begin with, so conventional banks will not lend money to them. According to the UN, globally women are far less likely to have a bank account than men, with the gap widest in South Asia, the Middle East and North Africa.On paper, lending money to poor women with no business experience could be seen as a very risky enterprise. But MFW hasn't found this to be a problem.Since the scheme began, MFW has given more than 816,000 loans with 96% to women between the ages of 18 to 60. It has become one of the main microfinance institutions in the country. But, Ms Sukhtian says, they still have a long way to go. ""We exist because we want to empower women, and it is known all over the world, women are the ones with the highest burden of financial challenges that come because of poverty.""She wants to expand the powerful enterprise throughout the region, and has no plans to slow down."
836,Money lending to the marginalised,"What could possibly link a Buddhist monk in Thailand to a social enterprise helping women take on financial responsibility in Jordan?Money. More specifically, micro-lending to marginalised groups.In Thailand, Phra Subin Paneeto uses Buddhist teachings to help him drive a community-based method of lending money to those in need. Those who partake in good deeds and don't drink alcohol or gamble are able to go to him to borrow funds for their day-to-day needs.Meanwhile, in Jordan in the Middle East, Microfund for Women helps poor women whom the banks have turned down take out loans so they can set up their own businesses. No collateral? No problem.Available to international users only."

Ms Inglis won her silver medal at Glasgow 2014."
839,Thailand school dormitory fire claims 17 lives,"At least 17 girls have been killed by a fire which swept through their school dormitory in northern Thailand.The fire broke out on Sunday evening in the dorm at Pithakkiart Witthaya school in Chiang Rai, which takes children from the region's poor hill tribes."
840,Thai beach murders: Convicted men appeal over deaths of two Britons,"Two Burmese men convicted of murdering two British travellers on a Thai beach have lodged appeals.Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were convicted of the murders in a Thai court and sentenced to death in December.The bodies of David Miller, 24, from Jersey and Hannah Witheridge, 23, from Norfolk, were found on a beach on Koh Tao in September 2014.Seven Thai lawyers and a team of international advisors are working to exonerate the Burmese pair.The appeal against the convictions and sentences was lodged at Koh Samui Court by May Thein and Phyu Shwe Nu, the mothers of the Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo, lawyers said.The parents then visited their sons at Bang Kwang Prison in Nonthaburi, where they have been held since January.  One of the advisors, Andy Hall, said: ""We have major problems with the judgments, particularly over the DNA evidence, and we don't believe the court can say beyond reasonable doubt that Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were responsible for the events which took place in September 2014."""
841,Thailand school dormitory fire kills 17 schoolgirls,"At least 17 girls have been killed by a fire which swept through their school dormitory in northern Thailand.The fire broke out on Sunday evening when many of the girls, aged between five and 13, were asleep, said police.One official told AFP that 38 students had been in the dorm at Pithakkiart Witthaya school in Chiang Rai, which takes children from the region's poor hill tribes.Two girls are still missing and another five were injured, two seriously.Police Col Prayad Singsin said the cause of the fire was still under investigation.Local media showed images of the two-storey building consumed by flames, with firefighters tackling the fire.The deputy governor of Chiang Rai, Arkom Sukapan said some of the students had still been awake so were able escape.""But others were asleep and could not escape resulting in the large number of casualties.""The Nation newspaper said the victims' bodies had been sent to a local hospital for identification, while a search continues for the two missing girls."
842,Anger over Thai broadcast of suicide threat,"The decision by Thai TV channels to broadcast hours of live coverage of a man threatening to kill himself has sparked public anger and concern about media ethics.The man, a suspected murderer, was surrounded by police on Thursday and said several times he was about to shoot himself. All of it was being watched in real time around the nation.As events unfolded, the media regulator took the unprecedented move of asking TV channels to stop broadcasting from the scene.Despite intense negotiations, the man suddenly shot himself in the head. He died later in hospital.While some channels had been careful to blur the image whenever 60-year-old Wanchai Danaitamonut was pointing the gun directly at his head - and did not show the actual moment he shot himself -  others live broadcast the entire event uncensored for hours on television and on their social media channels.""It was very possible that we would see a real suicide,"" said Prof Pirongrong Ramasoota, head of journalism at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University.""Sometimes Thai media try to appeal to the so-called morbid curiosity of people."" Wanchai Danaitamonut was suspected of killing two of his colleagues at Phranakhon Rajabhat University in Bangkok on Wednesday, in front of a graduate student. Local media cited police as saying he had professional conflicts with the two victims.He then fled the scene to a hotel where police tracked him down and surrounded him.Local media described an ""army of TV cameramen and reporters"" observing the standoff from the hotel parking lot. Almost six hours of negotiations later, including appeals from his family and former colleagues to give himself up, he shot himself at about 18:45 local time.Some hours into the standoff, the National Broadcasting Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) issued its warning to broadcasters.It ordered all television channels to stop broadcasting the live standoff. Such a broadcast of a sensitive incident could be regarded as an act that affects law and order, Supinya Klangnarong, NBTC member told Bangkok Post.Usually the NBTC reacts to complaints by the public, but according to Prof Ramsoota, an advisor on content to the NBTC, this was likely deemed ""a threat to public order"" and ""worthy of consideration of special action"".Prof Ramsoota said if the channels were deemed to be in violation of Thailand's media laws and section 37 - which covers forbidden content - they could be fined or lose their licences.But some have said the make-up of the media landscape in Thailand contributed to the extensive and uncensored coverage.The number of news channels in Thailand has grown in the last two year, and there is now intense competition, said Prof Pirongrong Ramasoota. That is what compelled them to show the disturbing images, she says. When one or two of them started broadcasting the incident, the rest followed suit.Phepchai Yong, president of the Thai Broadcast Journalists Association and group editor-in-chief at The Nation newspaper says there is no question it borders on crossing the line.""As a veteran journalist the images that we saw yesterday violate the basic ethics - you don't show that kind of image,"" he told the BBC.He argues that at more established media organisations such as The Nation editors were trying to follow some guidelines on what is appropriate for broadcast, but he suspects that at some of the newer less experienced channels that did not happen.""This kind of event was new for the Thai broadcast industry, its natural for them to give the audience what they think they wanted, without thinking about the image that appears on the screen,"" he said.""As journalists they should cover it but there should be required to put some controls in"".He says the sentiment among those in the industry today is to come together and establish a guideline broadcasters can follow.But some among the public want harsher action. Puchong Koompru told BBC Thai that all the awards and prizes for press in Thailand should be taken away as a penalty."
843,The Thai cleaning lady facing prison for 'I see',"A cleaning lady in Thailand is being charged by the government for posting the words ""I see"" on Facebook. She is accused of insulting the monarchy - a charge that can lead to jail sentences of up to 15 years. However, she says she is being punished because her son is an activist, as the BBC's Jonathan Head reports.Patnaree Chankij's home on the outskirts of Bangkok is a cramped, three-room house in which the 40-year-old widow lives with two of her children, and where she often does other people's laundry to make ends meet. At other times she works as a casual cleaner in apartments and offices.As in other houses in Thailand, there are portraits of King Bhumibol Adulyadej on the walls. Patnaree considers herself a loyal citizen, and says she has never said anything negative about the royal family.But earlier this month she was detained by the police and charged with lese majeste, insulting the monarchy, one of the most serious charges in the Thai criminal code. It carries a penalty of three to 15 years on each count and its use has escalated after the military coup two years ago.More than 60 people have been charged since then. Most of the cases are now heard in military courts, which restrict the rights of defence. Often they are heard in secret, with journalists finding out about them weeks later, if at all.Sentences are harsh. Last year a mother of two was given a sentence of 56 years for comments she made on Facebook - later halved after she pleaded guilty.So what did Patnaree do to get charged? According to her lawyer, the only evidence the police have produced is an exchange on Facebook between her and a political activist, in which she responded to comments the police say are defamatory with the Thai word ""ja"", which translates as ""I see"", or ""ok"".The police say she should have condemned the comments.Patnaree does not believe she has been charged over anything she said or wrote. She believes it is because of her son, Sirawith (which translates as New) Seritiwat.He is a political science student at Thammasat University, but over the past two years he has also emerged as the best-known face of student dissent against military rule.Right after the coup, as part of two groups called Resistant Citizens and Thai Student Centre for Democracy, he joined protests against the new government, using symbols like the three-fingered salute from the film series Hunger Games and reading George Orwell's classic novel 1984 in public.Last year they held a mock election outside a central Bangkok arts centre. Then they organised a protest train ride to a controversial royal-themed park, which had been built by the army, allegedly through some corrupt contracts.The groups now call themselves the New Democracy Movement.Although their demonstrations have been small, these activists are the only group openly challenging the military in Thailand. The so-called ""red shirt"" mass movement, which backed the government ousted by the coup, has largely been silent.The army has responded by detaining the students and putting them through what it calls ""attitude adjustment"", where they are pressured to change their views.More recently, the army has hardened its stance, filing criminal charges against some of the activists. Sirawith has been detained several times and charged twice, although he has not yet been tried.Now the military government is preparing to introduce a new constitution which will enshrine military dominance of politics for many more years. It would allow elections to take place as early as next year, but the charter weakens the power of elected governments and gives more power to a military-appointed senate, and to the conservative higher courts.The junta has promised a referendum on the constitution on 7 August, but with supporters of the ousted government likely to be hostile to a charter which would in all likelihood block their party from returning to power, the military has banned all campaigning against it. Those who try to sway public opinion are threatened with 10-year prison sentences.At the same time, thousands of government officials are being trained to go out and inform the public about the constitution, and to persuade them to vote.In that way the military hopes to win the August vote. Losing it would be a serious blow to the credibility of a government which has always insisted that most Thai people support its plans to restructure the country. It is not a result the military will leave to chance.Activists like Sirawith Seritiwat are a threat to that strategy, and in the weeks leading up to the referendum the soldiers are sure to redouble their efforts to stifle dissenting voices."

845,Thais celebrate Leicester City's Premier League success,"English football team Leicester City are in Bangkok, hosted by their Thai billionaire owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, to celebrate their historic Premier League win.The team had been predicted to be relegated at the start of the season, but defied all expectations to claim the trophy.The BBC's Jonathan Head says many people in Thailand are big fans of football, and Leicester City's unexpected success is a huge morale boost for them."
846,Leicester City arrive in Bangkok to heroes' welcome,"Members of Premier League-winning team Leicester City have arrived in Bangkok for a celebratory tour.Leicester City, who rose from likely relegation to league champions in just one season, are owned by Thai billionaire Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who arranged their visit. Players and staff were welcomed to Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi International Airport by cheering supporters. On Monday, more than 240,00 people watched them parade in their home town. Team coach Claudio Ranieri and captain Wes Morgan were among the players who made the trip to Thailand. However midfielder Riyad Mahrez was not among the line up, nor were Danny Drinkwater and Jamie Vardy who had been called up for international duties. Support for the Foxes, as they are known, has gained momentum across Thailand, as football supporters have slowly started to shift away from popular clubs such as Manchester United and Liverpool. The club remained largely unknown in Thailand until it was bought over by Mr Srivaddhanaprabha six years ago. The brand of his duty-free company King Power features prominently on the players' blue jerseys, with the club's home stadium also named after the company. ""Now I'm half Liverpool, half Leicester"", said 20-year-old Max Akkhapracha, speaking to AFP. ""It was a very exciting season, winning the Premier League was just amazing.""Leicester won the league 10 points above nearest rivals Arsenal, and will contest next season's Champions League competition against the best clubs in Europe."
847,Paradise lost: World's most beautiful places under threat of tourism,"It is the double-edged sword of tourism: On the one hand it brings the awareness of beautiful places and and economic development for the local population. On the other, this exposure can lead to uncontrolled numbers of tourists, damaging the beauty they came to see.As the authorities in Thailand close the island of Koh Tachai because of the toll of heavy tourism, we take a look at some other popular destinations that are at risk of losing their best asset.Since becoming the backdrop for the Hollywood film The Beach, this tropical paradise has come under increasing pressure as the result of a largely uncontrolled tourism boom. Koh Phi Phi and nearby islands welcome more than 1.4 million tourists a year, according to the Tourism Council of Thailand.Coral reefs have been destroyed by boat anchors and scuba divers, and the marine environment has been damaged by pollution from motorboats and the dumping of untreated waste into the sea. Known for its beautiful beaches and tropical reefs, Cozumel island, off the coast of Mexico, was once a peaceful place until docks were built for cruise ships. Today, it is the second most popular cruise ship destination in the world.The fragile reefs are threatened by pollution and development, and the ships are causing the waters to get warmer and damage the coral. The wider region gets 63,000 port calls from ships each yearThey generate 82,000 tonnes of rubbish a year.The average cruise ship carries 600 crew members and 1,400 passengers. Passengers on a cruise ship each account for 3.5kg of rubbish a day, compared with 0.8kg per local inhabitantSource: Our Planet, UNEP magazine, 1999The Indonesian island of Bali is under threat of increased deforestation, as the area makes way for the tourism industry and Indonesia's growing population. Tourism is growing at an exponential rate, but the infrastructure is not, resulting in mountains of waste that have nowhere to go.Non-native animals and plants also threaten the island.Although it is not quite mass tourism, thousands of tourists flock to the Galapagos Archipelago every year to experience the unique biodiversity and its pristine environment. But this island habitat is extremely sensitive to outside pressure, not only from too many tourists and the resulting development, but from the invasive species they are bringing with them. As a consequence, the Galapagos Islands has been put on Unesco's World Heritage list.Since Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay reached the top of Mount Everest in 1953,  tens of thousands of hikers have trekked to base camp and almost 7,000 climbers have made it to the summit. There was a two-year gap in the stream of climbers after a deadly avalanche in 2014 and another a year later caused by the Nepal earthquake, but this spring the expeditions have started up again.First climbers to reach summit in two yearsChina shames tourists leaving graffiti on EverestAvalanche fears over unauthorised Everest helicopter flightsThe sheer number of people visiting has had a huge impact on this fragile environment.Climbers take with them things including climbing equipment, food, plastics, tins, aluminium cans, glass, clothes, papers and tents. Some of this is left behind.But sanitation is the biggest problem - about 11,000 kilo of human excrement is removed every year, which leaves you to imagine how much is left on the mountain."
848,Thailand to close Koh Tachai island over tourism damage,"Thai authorities are set to close the island of Koh Tachai, saying heavy tourism is negatively affecting natural resources and the environment.The island, off Phang Nga province, is part of the Similan National Park.Almost all Thai marine national parks close to tourists from mid-May to mid-October for monsoon season but Tachai will not reopen, the Bangkok Post says.The park is popular with tourists and divers - who will still have access to a few dive sites in the area.""We have to close it to allow the rehabilitation of the environment both on the island and in the sea without being disturbed by tourism activities before the damage is beyond repair,"" Tunya Netithammakul, director general of the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plants Conservation, told the Post.Local media cited experts saying a beach on Koh Tachai could hold about 70 people, but sometimes the number of tourists was well over 1,000, along with food stalls and tour boats.That was far in excess of the island's sustainable capacity and was causing damage that threatened to become irreversible, reports said.Thailand draws tens of millions of tourists a year, many of them to its beautiful beaches and islands. Phi Phi Islands in Thailand - since becoming the backdrop for the Hollywood film The Beach, this tropical paradise has come under increasing pressure as a result of an uncontrolled tourism boom. Cozumel island, Mexico - this has become the world's second most popular holiday destination for cruise ships, causing huge damage to the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef. Galapagos Islands, Ecuador - the unique ecosystem on this isolated island is extremely sensitive not only to growing numbers of tourists, but to the invasive species they are bringing with them. Steve Downing from the UK snorkelled and dived on the island last year.""It's a miniature paradise - so long as you can get away from the crowds,"" he said. ""Unfortunately a lot of inexperienced snorkelers tend to ruin the fragile reef systems by bashing into the corals, poking about, trying to take the best photos of fish by feeding and chasing after fish.""""People aren't interested in preserving the wildlife, they're only interested in taking photographs,"" he added."
849,Leicester City FC pledges £2m to children's hospital,"The owner of Leicester City FC has pledged to make a £2m donation to help build a new children's hospital.Thai billionaire businessman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha has promised to give the cash to Leicester Hospitals Charity after LCFC's first top-flight title.The team at Leicester's Children's Hospital were ""overwhelmed"" for the ""gift"" towards the £30m project.The club's chief executive Susan Whelan made the announcement at the Foxes' end of season awards on Tuesday night.Last week, Leicester City FC were confirmed Premier League champions in one of the greatest sporting stories of all time.But the party got into full swing as Claudio Ranieri's players lifted the trophy following their final home game of the season on Saturday.Ms Whelan said: ""It's very important for every fortunate thing that happens to you in your life, you must give back. That's really integral to everything we do.""Got a call from Mr Vichai he said to pledge £2m to Leicester Hospitals Charity.""This is through the Srivaddhanaprabha family, this is King Power, this is Leicester City Football Club saying thank you to the city of Leicester.""You have opened your hearts to us. We are so very privileged and pleased to be a part of that.""The city's children's services are currently based at the Leicester Royal Infirmary (LRI) and Glenfield Hospital, but the plan is to bring them all into a single new Children's Hospital at the LRI.Dr Johannes Visser, of Leicester's Children's Hospital, said the project would ""involve enormous amounts of work... to create purpose built space"" for the young people.""This gift from Leicester City Football Club will help us make these plans a reality.""Debbie Adlerstein, head of fundraising at Leicester Hospitals Charity, said the donation would put them in the ""Premier League of children's hospitals""."
850,Smartwatch cheats force Thai students back to exam halls,"Some 3,000 students in Thailand must retake university entrance exams after a cheating scam involving cameras and smartwatches was uncovered.The sophisticated scam happened at Rangsit University in Bangkok.The university says three people filmed their test papers using tiny cameras embedded in their glasses.They then transmitted the images to an outside team, who sent the correct answers to the smartwatches of three other students taking the exams.One admitted he was being charged $24,000 (£17,000) to receive the right answers to get into medical school.There is tough competition to get into medical school in Thailand but potentially high rewards, as patients from around the world travel to Thailand for medical treatment.The university's rector, Arthit Ourairat, told the Bangkok Post the students involved had been blacklisted and would not be allowed to apply to study there again.The newspaper said the people filming the exams left partway through so they could transmit the films of the test papers to the outside team.The students involved have not been named and it is not clear whether they are part of a wider network.Mr Ourairat made the scam public in a post on Facebook. It was shared tens of thousands of times.""If they had passed and graduated, we might have had illegal doctors working for us,"" commented one person."
851,Changing the rules: Breaking transgender taboos at work,"With an estimated 15 million transgender men and women in the world, according to the United Nations, the BBC is taking a look at how some are are breaking social barriers in the workplace and changing the world around them. In the Indian state of Maharashtra, Matthew Wheeler and Priti Gupta spend time at a unique police checkpost.And in Thailand's capital Bangkok, Hoang Nguyen visits a model agency with a difference.The question is, what makes these two very different workplaces, which are so far apart, actually very similar?In the melee of honking horns and swerving wheels on a busy Indian road, a policeman with a whistle is easy to miss. But throw in two or three transgender inspectors in high visibility jackets and there's no problem stopping the traffic. By working together with these volunteers, the police in rural Thane, north-east of Mumbai gain extra help and a vital new source of information, while their transgender assistants gain credibility and respect. They are suddenly viewed in a position of authority by members of the public who had previously looked down upon them and mocked them. This particular scheme started when, at the end of last year, a group of transgender women stopped a thief who was being chased by a police patrol car.  The force then invited the group to join what is known as the local ""police mitra"", or friends of the police. Their duties include crowd management at festivals, visiting slums and communities to advise on security, and offering a trusted point of contact for people concerned about crime in their area.In India attitudes to those whose gender identity differs from their assigned sex can often be negative, forcing many transgender men and women to live life on the margins of society. But it's hoped this scheme will lead to change across the country. Volunteer inspector Shreeshah is a graduate but despite her education, had found it hard to get a job. But working with the police has changed how others treat her. ""I am not treated in an inhuman way as I was before. I can walk freely on the roads now,""Rajesh Pradhan of the Maharashtra Police believes the scheme, which has seen around 50 people sign up, has been a great success and wants more volunteers. ""Their potential for policing is tremendous,"" he says.It was down to foreign demand that Siwaporn Hotarapawanond started to see the potential in trans models.Ms Hotarapawanond, nicknamed Apple, said because there are many transgender people in Thailand, she just thought that there would be opportunities for them to work in the modelling  industry. Since opening the world's first trans model division in October 2014, Apple Model Management Ltd has recruited around 50 transgender models - from Thailand, Russia, Spain, England, Sweden, the US and the Philippines.But while trans men and women are no longer pushed to the fringes of society, Apple says more needs to be done to make the business world more open-minded.""The minute that the clients know the girls are transgender, fewer than 50% get to the casting stage"", she says. ""They said that they don't want them to be presenters for the products because they're afraid about the image. In business it is like this.""How social entrepreneurs are tackling the world's problems'We will give that food to someone who is hungry''If you're not honest, you can't borrow''I want to train more water warriors'Fighting back against harassers in the Middle EastBreaking transgender taboos at workSpecial Report: Changing the RulesThis was partly why Nisjanaaj Sudlarphaar, who models using the name Sarina, left Thailand for New York four years ago.""When I worked as a model in New York, most people didn't know I was transgender. Two years ago, I came back here and things started to change. ""They were happy to see one little girl who went to New York and worked with international people,"" she says. She believes her experience brings hope.Apple says that other agencies would represent the trans models as women, whereas now they could be open about their transgender status. In fact, others are now starting to copy her business model.""Of course they understand that the clients are going to refuse them. But we are showing them to the clients and explaining that they can work the same as anyone else. ""The clients may not like them because of their looks, but we say don't judge them because of how they're born."" "
852,Bringing transgender people into the workforce,"It is estimated that there are as many as 15 million transgender people in the world but most of us will not be aware of working with transgender people.Just north of Mumbai in India the police force are working with transgender volunteers and training them to be ""friends of the police"". Around 50 volunteers have been taken on and the aim is to bring the community into mainstream society. Meanwhile Apple Model Management has been blazing a trail. It has been operating the world's first division for transgender models for some years now.

853,Leicester City win the Premier League: How the world viewed the victory,"Leicester City winning the Premier League trophy was at one point less likely than Elvis turning up alive.Just as unlikely, at the start of this Premier League season, was that the club from the Midlands in the UK would become known around the world.When the final whistle blew in the 2-2 draw between Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur on Monday, confirming Leicester's title, it was 21:55 in west London, 13:55 in Los Angeles, and 03:55 on Tuesday in Bangkok.In the five minutes after the result was confirmed, more than 493,000 tweets using the word ""Leicester"" were sent worldwide, hitting a peak of some 140,000 tweets in the minute right after the final whistle blew.The true global appeal of football, and perhaps of the underdog story, was shown in the fact that cities including Sydney, Mumbai, Istanbul and Rio de Janeiro were among those taking the keenest interest online in Leicester's success.One country with an eye on the result was Thailand, even if it was confirmed there in the middle of the night.Leicester City were taken over by Thai owners in 2010, and the stadium has been renamed after King Power, owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha's travel retail firm.The 596,000 people who like the club's official Thai page on Facebook were in celebratory mood when the result came in. One user, Anantawat Jhansubin, replied: ""Don't forget to bring the trophy to Thailand!"" Many other Thai people writing on the Facebook page gave credit to Buddhist monk Phra Prommangkalachan, who is revered by the club's owners. He gave blessings to the team at the start of the season, and has created banners to pray for the club's success.The Bangkok newspaper The Nation reported comments by Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, the chairman's son, that the players would visit Thailand soon, although hopefully in less controversial circumstances than last year. ""Thai people should be given a lot of credit as all players acknowledge how much support they have been given,"" he said. ""All players believe, so do all the Thai fans."" He said he hoped to tie blue and yellow flags on the Premier League trophy when it is handed over - blue, as it is the club's traditional colour, and yellow as that is the colour associated with the Thai king.When the result came in, the rather convoluted hashtag #lahazanadeportivamasepicadelahistoria (The most epic athletic feat in history) became a trending topic in Mexico, as did #elsuenosecumplio (The dream is fulfilled).Christian Parkinson, a BBC cameraman based in Johannesburg, is Leicester-born and a life-long fan of the club. He learned the result in mid-air on the way to South Africa.France's sports newspaper L'Equipe published a detailed online segment dedicated to Leicester's win, paying tribute to the success of ""the surprise package, this well-oiled machine that has transfixed people way beyond England's shores"".La Gazzetto dello Sport in Italy wrote that ""there is no football fan in England or outside that does not recognise the achievement of this great little club, and its Italian leader"", referring to manager Claudio Ranieri.How do you explain Leicester's success to Americans?In India, the Times of India's Hijam Raju Singh wrote: ""The wait for the 'fairytale ending' of the 'beautiful story' is over. The biggest underdog story in recent times has met the ending everyone was hoping for.""Japan's NTV made Leicester's win its main sports story of the day, and understandably focused heavily on the club's Japanese international striker Shinji Okazaki and his part in Leicester's ""long-cherished wish"" to win the league.FranceOne of the largest broadcasters, TF1, failed miserably. The joy of the sports team was evident, the ability to pronounce 'Leicester' less so: it becomes 'Lie-stair', its captain Wes Morgan renamed 'Vess'. Must try harder. Yellow cardSpainExcellent - the team at RTVE clearly did its research. It is pronounced the right way, albeit with a Spanish flourish on the R of Leicester. 5-0 home winItalyLa Repubblica newspaper wanted to find out, so took to the streets (you can watch the very funny results here). Some people managed to pronounce it perfectly, but it seems the consensus in Rome is that it is said 'Lie-Chester'. Creditable 1-1 drawJapanNTV's attempt was not great. Not great at all.

860,Gay couple win custody battle against Thai surrogate mother,"A same-sex American-Spanish couple have won a high-profile custody battle over a baby born through a Thai surrogate mother who wanted to keep the child after she found out they were gay.Bangkok's Family Court ruled the legal guardian of the child is Gordon Lake, her biological father from the US.The child was born before a Thai ban on commercial surrogacy was imposed.Correspondents say that the case was complicated by the fact that Thai law does not recognise same-sex marriages.""The court has granted legal custody of [the child] Carmen Lake to Gordon Lake, my client, and [said] that my client is her only guardian,"" Mr Lake's lawyer Rachapol Sirikulchit said.Mr Lake and his partner, Spaniard Manuel Santos, both 41, have been in Thailand since beginning their legal battle over Carmen since she was born in January 2015.Thailand's crackdown on 'wombs for rent'Thailand bans foreigner surrogacyMr Santos emerged from the court smiling and tearful. ""We won,"" he told journalists. ""We are really happy... This nightmare is going to end soon.""He said Carmen would now fly to Spain, where the couple live.When the child was born, Thai surrogate Patidta Kusolsang handed her over to Mr Lake and Mr Santos, who left the hospital with her in their arms. But they say Ms Kusolsang subsequently changed her mind and refused to sign documents allowing Carmen to get a passport so that she could leave Thailand.While Mr Lake is Carmen's biological father, the egg came from an anonymous donor - not the surrogate mother.Mr Lake and Mr Santos were informed that Ms Kusolsang had assumed the child was being looked after by an ""ordinary family"" and that she worried about the child's upbringing.Mr Lake began a crowdfunding website that has raised about $36,000 to help cover the costs of the trial and staying in Thailand.Thailand in February 2015 banned foreigners from paying Thai women to be surrogates, after two high-profile cases sparked debate in 2014.The legislation also bans the use of agents, or any promotion of women willing to carry babies for others. Under the new law, only married Thai couples or couples with one Thai partner who have been married at least three years can seek surrogacy, and commercial surrogacy is banned.Anyone caught hiring a surrogate mother faces a maximum jail sentence of 10 years.Agents touting surrogate mothers would also face imprisonment if caught.Surrogacy is unlawful in Spain."

862,Japanese region entices tourists with romance novels,"Japan's smallest prefecture is aiming to attract more Thai tourists by sponsoring a series of romance novels set in the region.The southern Kagawa Prefecture has teamed up with four Thai writers for the initiative, who have each penned love stories inspired by their travels around the area, the Kyodo news agency reports. The series has been named Kagawa, Let Love Lead, and was launched at Thailand's National Book Fair in Bangkok. Tourism officials are hoping that romantically-minded Thais will be inspired to hop on a plane after reading the novels, which include Winter Love in Takamatsu, and Shodoshima Forever. Author Sirikarn Suppalertporn spent a week travelling around the region to research her novel - Destiny in Kotohira - sponsored by the local authorities. ""I have visited only Japan's big cities, like Tokyo and Osaka, so I was intrigued to experience Japan's small towns, like Kotohira,"" she tells Kyodo.Japan as a whole has seen tourism figures boom in recent months, particularly among South Korean and Chinese visitors.

863,Australian couple 'did not reject Down's baby' Gammy,"An Australian couple involved in an international surrogacy dispute did not abandon their surrogate baby in Thailand, a court has found. Australian David Farnell and his wife Wendy turned to surrogacy after they were unable to conceive naturally.In December 2013, surrogate Pattaramon Chanbua gave birth to a boy, Gammy, and a girl, Pipah, conceived with Mr Farnell's sperm and donor eggs.Ms Chanbua had said the couple rejected Gammy because he had Down's syndrome.The Farnells returned to Australia with Pipah in February 2014 and Ms Chanbua sought a court order to have the girl returned to Thailand.Revelations that Mr Farnell was a convicted child sex offender added to controversy surrounding the case. Where can you legally have a surrogate baby?Thailand's crackdown on 'wombs for rent'But Chief Judge Stephen Thackray of Western Australia's Family Court ruled in a judgement released on Thursday that Pipah should stay with the Farnells.The judge acknowledged the case was emotionally charged for all parties, saying conflicts were exacerbated by cultural differences and the constant need for a translator.""Their ability to recall what happened, and in what order, has been impaired by the anxiety felt for the health of the babies, and by the tensions that arise when a woman's body is rented for the benefit of others and where the unit of exchange is measured in the life of a new human being,"" Judge Thackray said.The court noted that although Mr Farnell, 58, was a convicted sex offender, there was a ""low risk of him abusing the girl"".The judge also found Mr Farnell and his wife did not access a trust fund set up for Gammy, as was initially reported after the story broke in 2014.Gammy's case drew donations from around the world, which have been managed by an Australian charity and used to pay his hospital bills and buy a new home for Ms Chanbua's family.Judge Thackray said in his ruling that Gammy appeared to be ""thriving"" in Thailand with the ""love and support"" of Ms Chanbua's extended family.Last year Thailand passed laws banning foreigners from paying Thai women to be surrogates following the high-profile case.Only married Thai couples or couples with one Thai partner who have been married at least three years can seek surrogacy.Anyone caught hiring a surrogate mother now faces a maximum jail sentence of 10 years.

Courts will be able to decide who deserves the punishment, the Bangkok Post reports.Thailand's annual three-day New Year festival, known as Songkran, sees revellers throughout the country take part in water fights.The government has assured tourists that despite severe drought the event will go ahead as usual.Heavy drinking is common and the week of the festival is nicknamed the ""Seven Deadly Days"" because of a spike in road accidents.The government earlier this year said the cars of drunk drivers could be impounded for the duration of the holiday."

It carries a maximum 15-year jail term.Critics say the law has been used to silence discussion about the royals. Line is one of the most popular messaging apps in Asia.Suppaset Chokechai, commander of the police technology crime suppression division, confirmed the investigation with the BBC but declined to give any more information on the case.The stickers depicted various members of the family, including the revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej and his children, and appeared to reference rumours about them.But some stickers also feature known facts about them, such as the king's fondness for the saxophone and Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn's deceased pet dog.The set appeared to have been submitted to a section of Line's online shop where users can sell stickers to others. Line reviews submissions before they are put on sale.Line issued a statement on Thursday saying it had withdrawn the stickers, saying they ""may have caused discomfort among our users in Thailand"".It added that it would continue to improve its processes and ""consider cultural aspects of each country"".Thailand has seen an increased spate of arrests under lese majeste in recent years, some under broad interpretations of the law.Since its coup in 2014, the military government has used the law to arrest a string of suspects accused of claiming or using connections to the monarchy for personal benefit."
869,The Islamic State threat in South East Asia,"Several countries in South East Asia have been anticipating attacks by the so-called Islamic State (IS) group in the region. Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore warned their citizens in 2015 that it was a question of when, rather than if, they would take place and this foresight was sadly proven right with the attack on Jakarta in January this year.  Authorities in the region have learned from Indonesia's experience of the Bali bombings in 2002 and several attacks afterward. These were carried out by Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) militants inspired by Al Qaeda, several of whom went to Afghanistan to fight with the Taliban in the 1980s, and then returned to the region with the skills and knowledge to carry out large-scale attacks. IS is proving a new draw to would-be jihadists across the region. Several militant groups in South East Asia have pledged allegiance to it and up to 1,000 people are believed to have left Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines to fight with the group in Syria and Iraq. Indonesian and Malay speakers there have formed an official wing of the group, known as Katibah Nusantara Daulah Islamiyah, and security experts believe its leaders are trying to fund and encourage attacks across the region. Over the past year, IS has increased its propaganda efforts in Indonesian, which is similar to Malay, inciting people to join it but also to carry out attacks where they are. The Jakarta attack in January, originally thought to have been directed by an Indonesian militant in Syria called Bahrun Naim, is now believed to have been organised by a local group called Jamaah Anshar Khilifah, who are followers of an influential jailed cleric, Aman Abdurrahman. The authorities have also been watching for foreign militants who may travel to the region to pass on or pick up battlefield knowledge. Militant groups in the region are known to work together and fighters sometimes travel to another country to evade arrest in their own. South East Asia's long coastlines and porous borders make it difficult for the authorities to monitor or stop such movement. In the last few months, the Philippine army has killed two Malaysians fighting with Abu Sayyaf in the south. Indonesian authorities have arrested four Uighurs from China over links to the Mujahidin Indonesia Timur (MIT) group in Sulawesi, and recently killed two who were fighting with MIT. Militants from Syria, Iraq and Turkey have also been sighted in the region, and arrested in some cases over planned attacks.  Security experts believe competition to lead a potential official IS regional province may spur further attacks. IS has acknowledged pledges by some groups in the region but not yet formally declared it a ""province"" as it has with other areas, such as Boko Haram in Africa, though there are signs it is moving toward doing so.

871,Thaksin Shinawatra bowls seized by Thai police,"Thai police have seized thousands of small bowls carrying a message signed by ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.They also arrested the female politician from his party in whose house they were found.She has now been charged with sedition, which can carry seven years in prison.It is the latest sign of the tense dispute between Thaksin supporters and Thailand's military government, says BBC East Asia editor Jill McGivering.The bowls at the centre of the row are small, red and plastic - and typically used for water. Written on them is ""The situation may be hot but you can be cooled by this water"", along with Mr Thaksin's signature. The move comes several days after another woman posted a picture of herself on Facebook smiling as she held up a similar bowl. She too has been charged with sedition. Our East Asia editor says this shows the ruling military junta's determination to stifle shows of support for Mr Thaksin and his sister Yingluck, who have both served as prime minister and both face corruption charges that they deny.Mr Thaksin has been living in self-imposed exile for 10 years, while Ms Yingluck is facing a decade in jail over a negligence charge linked to farming subsidies distributed while she was in office.Thailand's struggle to overcome its deep and bitter political divide has been reflected in some of the social media responses to this latest incident. Some said it sounded like a late April Fool's joke. One wrote that the bowls should be given away with bags of rotten rice as a reminder of Mr Thaksin's alleged corruption. Others described the police response as absolutely ridiculous, urging them to concentrate on more serious issues than free plastic bowls."

873,How an alcoholic monk founded her own monastery,"Fifty years ago, Luang Poh Yaai lived as a Buddhist monk - a first for a woman in Thailand where religious authorities bar females from the monkhood. Today some get round the ban by getting ordained abroad and returning to live in monasteries for women.The temple of Wat Thamkrabok sits at the foot of a sweeping, craggy outcrop in the countryside north of Bangkok.  Its courtyard is shaded by ancient trees.  Once a day, its temporary residents kneel alongside a grate that covers a deep drain, and breathe deeply.  Next to each of them is a metal bucket full of drinking water.  In turn, they are offered a small glass of dark liquid, poured by a monk from an ancient bottle.  They drink.  Within seconds the still air is assaulted by the sound of retching.  As the young men vomit into the drain, the monks offer encouragement, tell them to keep drinking water, and place reassuring hands on bare shoulders.  Those undergoing this punishing regime are all drug and alcohol addicts. And it was Luang Poh Yaai who introduced the detox programme to treat opium addiction in 1959.  She was an excellent herbalist, and the preparation drunk by the addicts is still made to her recipe.        Beside the temple, away from the courtyard where the addicts are treated, is a workshop - it is the domain of Luang Pi Ai, one of the monks.  An old table heaves under the weight of dozens of statues-in-the-making - all representations of Luang Poh Yaai.  And there is a life-size, fibreglass figure of her.""I made this 30 years ago,"" explains Luang Pi Ai.  ""It was one of my first and my best because I made it from my soul.""He was ordained at the temple when he was 19, and has a particular reason to feel grateful to Luang Poh Yaai.""My father was the very first addict to be successfully treated here,"" he says. ""He was an opium addict - back then there was only opium.  After he followed the programme here he never touched drugs again.""Find out moreThai Buddhism - Monks, Mercs and Women is broadcast on Crossing Continents on BBC Radio 4 at 11:00 on Thursday 31 March. You can catch up on the iPlayer.The details about Luang Poh Yaai's early life are sketchy.  According to an account by Ian G Baird, from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, as a child she claimed to remember her past lives and communicated with spirits.  Later, she married and had two children, but abandoned by her husband, she lived in a Bangkok slum and became an alcoholic.  At the age of 40, or thereabouts, Luang Poh Yaai again remembered her past lives, stopped drinking and became a white-robed Buddhist nun, or mae chee.  In 1957 she founded the temple with her two nephews.  By then she was wearing monks' robes.""One day she understood the truth, and she changed her clothes right away - there was no formal ordination,"" says the current abbot of the temple, Phra Ajahn Boonsong, who studied under Luang Poh Yaai for three years until she died in 1970.     ""If you were an outsider, you wouldn't have guessed she was a woman,"" he says, though all her followers knew, and no-one expressed concern or disapproval.""Away from her community, however, it could be different.  ""Once, she was arrested in another province, and charged with imitating a monk, which is illegal in Thailand,"" says Phra Ajahn Boonsong.""She explained to the authorities she had become a monk to stop herself sinning, and not so she could take advantage of anyone else.  So eventually they let her go.""   Although Luang Poh Yaai's story is still not well-known in Thailand, for some people she's important.  ""It seems she had a connection with the divine spirit, and the herbal medicine that she used was told to her by the divine spirit,"" says the Venerable Dhammananda, a monk since 2001.Dhammananda is a former academic, TV presenter - and a woman. She travelled to Sri Lanka - where female monks are allowed - to be ordained. She returned home the first Thai woman to be fully ordained in the Theravada Buddhist tradition, and is now abbess at the Songdhammakalyani monastery in Nhakon Pathom, west of Bangkok. ""Back then, I didn't think it was anything great…  I was just doing my duty, keeping alive the heritage that the Buddha gave us.  But to look back - unless there was that one woman who walked ahead, the movement would not have started.""In Thailand, reactions to Dhammananda were often negative.""In the beginning… 'Oh! You dare wear the robe!' And I said, 'Well I'm a monk, I'm a female monk, what else do you want me to wear?' It still happens now, but only when I go to a public toilet - they always try to throw me out and send me to the male toilet because they associate the robes with men.  But we make a joke of it, and they accept me.""Now there are about 100 women monks in Thailand - all of them ordained abroad.  Fifteen women live at the Songdhammakalyani monastery, where life is punctuated by meditation and stillness. The monks work too - maintaining the temple grounds, delivering workshops in prisons, and welcoming members of the public who attend services or come seeking help.And Dhammananda is about to branch out and establish a new community further south in Thailand.Compared to some 300,000 men living in monasteries in Thailand, women like Dhammananda are part of a tiny minority.  But they may be gaining a better reputation than some of their male counterparts.  Repeated allegations in the newspapers about sexual offences, fraud and wildlife trafficking, have led to disillusionment in her community, she says, something the women notice when they go out collecting alms - food, drinks and offerings of flowers.     ""Some households have already stopped giving alms to the male monks - they lost respect.  And then when they see these female monks coming out, then they start giving alms again."" She also sees growing signs of encouragement for female monks from Thailand's male counterparts.""Some of them do support us,"" she says.  ""More and more on our temple's Facebook page, monks visit to learn about what we do.  And when we arranged our latest international ordination in Sri Lanka, many monks said, 'Satu' which means 'Well done' - or they clicked 'Like'.""Phra Ajahn Boonsong, the abbot of Wat Thamkrabok, will not be drawn on whether Thailand should allow the ordination of women. He says only this: ""In the Buddhist world there is only one truth, and there is no gender.""Paul has come from Australia in the hope of being cured of his addiction to crystal meth.  He is on day four of the detox programme, and is surprised to learn the founder of the temple, and the initiator of his treatment, was a woman - it is not written anywhere in English on the temple's website.  But he knows what he would say to Luang Poh Yaai if she were here.""Thank you very much for giving us an opportunity to begin a new life.  And to anyone who wants to stop their bad habit, welcome to Wat Thamkrabok.""Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox."

875,Dog in Thailand appears to smile after being stung by a wasp,"A dog which was stung by a wasp appears to be smiling after being taken to a vet in Bang Saen, near Bangkok in Thailand.The sister of the golden retriever's owner, Natthathida Nilbut, posted the pictures on Facebook on Sunday.Since then the post has had more than 23,000 likes and has been shared more than 6,000 times. Other people have also been sharing pictures of their dogs after they were stung by wasps and bees.Natthathida posted later to say the dog was OK after being treated by the vet.Her sister wrote that she'd probably get a slap when she got home and wasn't sure whether to feel pitiful or whether it served her right. The best advice for dogs when they're stung by a bee or a wasp is to get them to a vet to be looked at as soon as possible.Swelling around the mouth or throat can be especially dangerous because it can cut off the airway, and watch out for vomiting or pale gums.Before that cold water can help with the swelling, or an ice pack if you can keep it pressed against the sting mark.Dog owners are warned not to try to pick a bee's stinger out with their finger nails as more poison can be injected into the pet's body. Use a credit card instead to scrape it off.If it's a bee sting use something like bicarbonate of soda to neutralise the sting and use vinegar for wasps.Vets often prescribe antihistamines to take down swelling but don't give them any at home as they may cause an adverse effect. It can be quite difficult to tell the difference between bees and wasps because they share so many characteristics. Wasps in general are thinner with smoother bodies and bees tend to be rounder. Usually if it's hairy on its abdomen and legs then it's a bee.Find us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat"

878,Thailand's overweight monks are put on a diet,"Steps are being taken in Thailand to wean Buddhist monks off unhealthy food after a study suggested that almost half of them are overweight.Jongjit Angkatavanich, a health and nutrition expert at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University, says 48% of monks are obese, the Bangkok Post reports. Her warning that ""Obesity in our monks is a ticking time bomb"" seems to have given the religious authorities cause for concern, with her figures showing that 42% have high cholesterol levels, 23% suffer from high blood pressure, and over 10% are diabetic. Dr Jongjit didn't say how many monks were involved in a study, but she's helping to roll out a national programme aimed at slimming down Thailand's holy men.The government already covers medical fees for monks, who play a prominent part in Thailand's social and religious life, and spent more than 300m baht (£6m; $8.5m) on countering chronic obesity-related problems in 2012 alone, the paper says. Dr Jongjit singles out the sweet drinks and fatty foods that members of the public donate to the monks, and her Faculty of Allied Heath Sciences university is launching a campaign to promote leaner clerical living.A monastic college and four temples in Bangkok are pioneering nutritional cooking programmes heavy on fibre, protein and calcium, and encouraging the clerics to take more physical exercise. Dr Jongjit says the monks involved have already lost an average of one kilogram (2.2lb) in weight over eight weeks, cut their waistlines by 1.4cm (half an inch), and seen drops in cholesterol levels. Some monks complain that they don't know how much weight they're putting on, which is why Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital has launched a special girdle that tightens around the waist as a gentle reminder.

879,Bangkok bank chemical accident: Two executives charged,"Police in Thailand have charged two executives from a fire safety firm with negligence after a chemical accident killed eight people.The incident occurred at the headquarters of the Siam Commercial Bank in Bangkok on Sunday night.Contract workers were upgrading the fire extinguisher system when a chemical retardant was released, apparently suffocating them.Police are investigating how the system was set off.The executives, Adisorn Pokha and Napong Suksanguan, are from a firm called Mega Planet, which had contracted out the work. They face up to 10 years in prison if found guilty of negligence.Police Lt Gen Sanit Mahathaworn said they had expressed regret and were willing to pay compensation for damages, according to the Bangkok Post.The bank had said that an aerosol system called pyrogen was ""inadvertently activated and exhausted all the oxygen in the area"" as contractors were working on it.Pyrogen involves a mixture of gases including potassium carbonates, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide and ammonia. The system works by removing all oxygen from the air to stifle a fire.Seven of those killed were contractors and one person was a bank security guard. Seven others were injured."
880,Thailand chemical accident in Bangkok bank kills eight,"Eight people have died in a chemical accident in the basement of a Bangkok bank, officials have confirmed.The contractors were working on a fire safety system at the headquarters of the Siam Commercial bank on Sunday night, the bank said in a statement. They apparently suffocated after a gas mixture which depletes oxygen was released.Another seven were injured in the incident, which may have been caused by contractors' ""negligence"", it added.A bank spokesman told the BBC the incident took place in a vault storing documents in the head office in Bangkok.The bank said at around 21:30 local time on Sunday (14:30 GMT), an aerosol system called pyrogen was ""inadvertently activated and exhausted all the oxygen in the area"" as contractors were working on it.Pyrogen involves a mixture of gases including potassium carbonates, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide and ammonia.The system works by removing all oxygen from the air to stifle a fire.The Bangkok Post reported that firemen encountered delays as they tried to reach the victims due to tightly locked doors.The bank, one of Thailand's largest financial institutions, added that it would provide assistance to those in the accident and operations would continue normally.Correspondents say that fatal industrial accidents remain rare in Thailand.A toy factory fire in 1993 which killed nearly 200 people and injured another 500 is considered the worst the country has seen."
881,Anthony Kwan: Thailand withdraws charge against Hong Kong journalist,"Thailand has withdrawn criminal charges against a Hong Kong journalist detained last year for carrying personal body armour to report on the Bangkok blasts.The court where Anthony Kwan was due to stand trial next month confirmed that the case is no longer going ahead.Mr Kwan was arrested at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport in August when officials found the body armour and a helmet in his luggage.It is illegal to use such items without a weapons licence in Thailand.Mr Kwan had faced a possible five-year prison sentence.Journalists regularly use body armour and helmets when reporting from dangerous locations.His detention was criticised by his employer, Initium Media, as well as the Foreign Correspondents Club in Thailand.On Tuesday the club issued a statement saying it welcomed the decision, and reiterated that journalists ""who need to work in dangerous areas... be able to use appropriate protective equipment legally in Thailand"".Mr Kwan was allowed to leave Thailand shortly after he posted bail in August."
882,Missing Malaysia plane MH370: What we know,"The missing Malaysia Airlines plane, flight MH370, had 239 people on board and was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on 8 March 2014 when air traffic control staff lost contact with it.The search for the plane eventually focused on a 120,000 sq km area of seabed about 2,000km off the coast of Perth in the southern Indian Ocean.  It has now been suspended with no trace of the aircraft found there, and is likely to remain the world's greatest aviation mystery. This is what we know. Watch the video below to find out about the jet's last known movements.00:41, 8 March 2014 (16:41 GMT, 7 March):  Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 departed from Kuala Lumpur International Airport and was due to arrive in Beijing at 06:30 (22:30 GMT).Malaysia Airlines says the plane lost contact less than an hour after take-off. No distress signal or message was sent.01:07:  The plane sent its last ACARS transmission - a service that allows computers aboard the plane to ""talk"" to computers on the ground. Some time afterwards, it was silenced and the expected 01:37 transmission was not sent.01:19: The last communication between the plane and Malaysian air traffic control took place about 12 minutes later. At first, the airline said initial investigations revealed the co-pilot had said ""All right, good night"". However, Malaysian authorities later confirmed the last words heard from the plane, spoken either by the pilot or co-pilot, were in fact ""Good night Malaysian three seven zero"".A few minutes later, the plane's transponder, which communicates with ground radar, was shut down as the aircraft crossed from Malaysian air traffic control into Vietnamese airspace over the South China Sea.01:21: The Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam said the plane failed to check in as scheduled with air traffic control in Ho Chi Minh City.02:15: Malaysian military radar plotted Flight MH370 at a point south of Phuket island in the Strait of Malacca, west of its last known location. Thai military radar logs also confirmed that the plane turned west and then north over the Andaman sea. In maps accompanying its 1 May report, the Malaysian government revised the time to be 02:22 and put the position further west. 02:28 (18:28 GMT, 7 March): After the loss of radar, a satellite above the Indian Ocean picked up data from the plane in the form of seven automatic ""handshakes"" between the aircraft and a ground station. The first was at 02:28 local time.08:11: (00:11 GMT, 8 March) The last full handshake was at 08:11. This information, disclosed a week after the plane's disappearance, suggested the jet was in one of two flight corridors, one stretching north between Thailand and Kazakhstan, the other south between Indonesia and the southern Indian Ocean.08:19: However, there is some evidence of a further ""partial handshake"" at this time between the plane and a ground station. This was a request from the aircraft to log on. Investigators say this is consistent with the plane's satellite communication equipment powering up after an outage - such as after an interruption to its electrical supply.09:15: This would have been the next scheduled automatic contact between the ground station and the plane, but there was no response from the aircraft.  The plane's planned route would have taken it north-eastwards, over Cambodia and Vietnam, and the initial search focused on the South China Sea, south of Vietnam's Ca Mau peninsula.  But evidence from a military radar, revealed later, suggested the plane had suddenly changed from its northerly course to head west. So the search, involving dozens of ships and planes, then switched to the sea west of Malaysia.Further evidence revealed on 15 March 2014 by the Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak suggested the jet was deliberately diverted by someone on board about an hour after take-off. After MH370's last communication with a satellite was disclosed, a week after the plane's disappearance, the search was expanded dramatically to nearly three million square miles - about 1.5% of the surface of the Earth.However, from 16 March, tracking data released by the Malaysian authorities appeared to confirm that the plane crashed in the Indian Ocean, south west of Australia,  with possible locations refined following further satellite analysis.  There were a few false positives along the way. In early April 2015, Australian and Chinese vessels using underwater listening equipment detected ultrasonic signals, which officials believed could be from the plane's ""black box"" flight recorders. The pings appeared to be the most promising lead so far, and were used to define the area of a sea-floor search, conducted by the Bluefin-21 submersible robot.Nothing was found and it was only in December 2015 that Australian officials said they had refined the search area and were confident they were looking in the right area for the plane.In the end, an Australian-led search using underwater drones and sonar equipment deployed from specialist ships loaned by various nations combed a vast 120,000km area of the Southern Indian Ocean - but turned up nothing. In December 2016 investigators admitted the plane was unlikely to be in that search area and recommended searching further north. Experts identified a new area of approximately 25,000 sq km to the north of the current search area that had the ""highest probability"" of containing the wreckage. This was the last area the plane could possibly be located, given current evidence, the report said. But Australia ruled out continuing the search beyond its scheduled end. Although the underwater search turned up nothing, it was along a coastline thousands of miles away that clues began to wash up on beaches. On 29 July 2015, a 2m-long (6ft) piece of plane debris was found by volunteers cleaning a beach in St Andre, on the north-eastern coast of Reunion.MH370: The key pieces of debrisOn 5 August, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announced that investigators had ""conclusively confirmed"" the debris was from the missing plane, a finding confirmed by French officials.However, officials said this did not affect their search plans, as the debris had been carried to Reunion by ocean currents. It was the first of more than 20 pieces of possible debris found by members of the public, on the African coast and islands in the Indian Ocean. In November 2016, a report found the recovered wing flaps from the plane were not in the landing position when the plane went down in the Indian Ocean.It was a significant finding that helped investigators say with more certainty that the flight most likely made a rapid and uncontrolled descent into the Indian Ocean.  So some bereaved families of those on board the flight are determined to keep the hunt for these clues going. The 12 crew members were all Malaysian, led by pilots Captain Zaharie Ahmed Shah, 53, and 27-year-old co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid. There were 227 passengers, including 153 Chinese and 38 Malaysians, according to the manifest. Seven were children. Other passengers came from Iran, the US, Canada, Indonesia, Australia, India, France, New Zealand, Ukraine, Russia, Taiwan and the Netherlands. Two Iranian men were found to be travelling on false passports. But further investigation revealed 19-year-old Pouria Nour Mohammad Mehrdad and Delavar Seyed Mohammadreza, 29, were headed for Europe via Beijing, and had no apparent links to terrorist groups. Among the Chinese nationals was a delegation of 19 prominent artists, who had attended an exhibition in Kuala Lumpur.Malaysia Airlines said there were four passengers who checked in for the flight but did not show up at the airport.The family members of those on board were informed in person, by phone and by text message on 24 March that the plane had been lost.

883,Bangkok boat explosion injures more than 50 passengers,"At least 58 people were injured in Thailand's capital Bangkok after the engine on a water taxi exploded as it pulled into a pier.Most of the injured suffered from minor burns, police said, though two passengers were said to have been seriously hurt by flying debris.Initial reports suggested that a fuel leak was to blame.Water taxis ply the canals around Bangkok and are a popular form of transport in the traffic-choked city.Video of the incident posted by the Khao Sod newspaper shows the crowded boat pulling into Wat Thep Leela pier in eastern Bangkok with clouds of black smoke visible at the rear.A group of seemingly oblivious passengers initially try to board the boat before it is rocked by an explosion.Dozens of people are then seen leaping on to the pier to safety.Two Myanmar nationals and one Japanese national were among those injured, the Erawan medical emergency centre said.The boat ran on both diesel and liquefied natural gas, Khao Sod reported. The firm that runs the service is using only diesel on its boats until the results of the investigation are known, it said.More than 100,000 people use the canal boats in Bangkok every day, according to statistics from 2012."
884,Thai Airways returns to profit in fourth quarter,"Thai Airways has posted a profit in the three months to December, reversing its fortunes from the same period a year ago and softening its full-year losses.Quarterly net profit came to 5.1bn Thai baht ($141.7m) compared to a 6.4bn baht loss a year earlier, officials confirmed with the BBC.Full year net loss was 13.05bn baht compared to 15.57bn a year ago.The national carrier has been struggling amid an increasingly competitive regional marketplace.The carrier, which is 51% government owned, has been committed to turnaround plans, which have been in place for about 12 months.  Its operating losses for the full year were substantially reduced, which the carrier said was due in part to a 20% decrease in fuel expenses.On Monday, Thai Airways said that the world's aviation industry had continued to face several headwinds in 2015 including ""from economic and political uncertainty [and] the global economic recession"".It noted China's slowdown, ""a heavy expansion"" of low-cost airlines, and exchange rate fluctuations as some of the reasons for the industry's struggles. Thai Airways' so-called transformation plan was introduced in January last year and was designed to ""stop the bleeding"", the firm said on Monday. Over the last year, the carrier has reduced the number of flights it operates and cut unprofitable routes, amid other cost saving measures. The firm said it would also focus on voluntary retirements this year.It decommissioned several planes in 2015 and received eight new ones, bringing its fleet size to 95 aircraft, down from 102 a year earlier. On Monday, Thai Airways also addressed concerns over its international flight safety reputation and said it had not been affected by recent downgrades for Thailand's aviation industry. In December last year, the US downgraded its safety rating of Thailand's aviation authority following earlier findings by the United Nation's International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) found that Thailand did not comply with ICAO's safety standards. At the time, aviation experts said the national flag-carrier's code share agreements in the US could be hurt, however, the airline said it had not been affected by the downgrade. Thai Airways also said the European Commission had not recently added any Thai airlines to its air safety blacklist. The national flag carrier added that it had recently passed the safety standards audit by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)."
885,The Christians held in Thailand after fleeing Pakistan,"A BBC investigation has found that Thailand, a country known for its hospitality to tourists, routinely arrests and detains asylum seekers. Many are Pakistani Christians who have fled religious persecution in their own country. Some are children. And they are held despite being UN-registered asylum seekers, whom the UN is under a duty to protect.The sound of the faithful in prayer and song bursts out of a small rented room where a congregation of more than 100 people have gathered for Sunday mass.They would be risking their lives to worship like this in their homeland, where Islamist extremists force Christians to convert, or even kill them.Leading the prayers is Pastor Joshua, a Christian from Lahore, in what is officially known as the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Along with thousands of other Christians, he's had to flee to Thailand and still fears the people in Pakistan who punished him for converting from Islam to Christianity.""My bone was broken - the one right above the heart. And they tried to cut my arm off,"" he says.""My sister was murdered, she was burned alive, just because she spoke the word 'God'. They hate the word 'God' so much. She was burned for this reason alone.""The Pakistani Christians head to Thailand because it's easy to enter the country on a short-term tourist visa and in Pakistan's hostile neighbourhood there are few safe options closer to hand.But there is hardly a welcoming committee in Thailand. The country doesn't want asylum seekers from anywhere. It is not a signatory to the United Nations Refugee Convention, and anyone without a valid visa or a work permit risks being arrested, charged with illegal immigration and jailed.Thailand has allowed the UN refugee agency, the UNHCR, to step in and investigate the credibility of those claiming to flee persecution - a process with two possible outcomes, either repatriation or relocation to another country. But many of these families say they've been waiting years to be assessed by the UN and they have no access to work, education or healthcare.As they await the outcome of their case, thousands of Pakistani asylum seekers set up temporary home in dingy rooms in a network of tower blocks on the outskirts of Bangkok. People who were once comfortably-off professionals arrive with just a few possessions, their rent and food paid for by local Christian charities.And they live in constant fear.The Thai immigration police have lost patience with the UN's failure to process asylum cases in good time, one young father tells me, holding a 25-week-old baby in his arms.""They are taking people out of the rooms from everywhere, they can strike at any time, there is always tension,"" he says.I hear that the immigration police are raiding a block of rooms close by, so I go straight there and find dozens of women crying and clutching their children. The police have just broken down the doors and taken away all their husbands. Women and children were also taken from other blocks. All told, more than 50 Pakistani asylum seekers have been arrested.I find them at the local court, where they are handcuffed, charged with illegal immigration, fined 4,000 Baht (£90) and then sent to Bangkok's Immigration Detention Centre.The names of most interviewees have been changed, for their safety Chris Rogers reports for Our World: Thailand's Asylum Crackdown on the BBC News Channel on 27 and 28 February at 21:30 GMT and BBC World News starting on 26 February (click here for transmission times)Viewers in the UK can catch up on the BBC iPlayerThis isn't supposed to happen. All registered asylum seekers are issued with a UN document, which certifies them as an ""internationally recognised UN person of concern"". This means they should not be arrested or detained for seeking asylum while the UN investigates their case.Earlier I met one man called Sabir, who fled Pakistan two years ago with his wife, Laila, their two daughters, Laila's parents, and her siblings and grandparents. They shared a small, sparse room with no kitchen or toilet, all 10 of them - until Laila was arrested two months ago.Sabir hasn't seen her since and sobs that he is lost without her. He doesn't regret leaving Pakistan though, where he says a gang threatened to kill his family if they didn't convert to Islam. ""Over here, the only fear we have is of the immigration police, nothing else,"" he says. But the UN won't investigate his asylum case until 2018. He says he's been told there is a backlog. In a statement to the BBC, the UNHCR admits it is struggling. ""Amid the context of today's acute global humanitarian funding crunch, it is correct that at present we are facing long delays in the processing of asylum claims with funding for Thailand at only a third of the level needed."" But it adds that it has managed to prevent the arrest of more than 400 ""people of concern to UNHCR"" in the last six months, by insisting on their status as registered asylum seekers. Meanwhile the Thai government complains the UN's inactivity is ""creating far-reaching impacts on its security"" - a reference to Thai fears that immigrants from Pakistan could be involved in terrorism - ""leading to a number of arrests of illegal immigrants in the past year"".Anyone arrested - Sabir's wife, for example - is taken to Bangkok's filthy and overcrowded immigration detention centre. Journalists and cameras are not allowed inside but volunteers delivering much-needed fresh water and food for inmates are, and that is how I enter, with other members of the BBC crew. Wearing search-proof hidden cameras we nervously pass through security checks and hand over our water and food to be checked by the guards.We are led to a large, stiflingly hot room, crammed with hundreds of asylum seekers pressing their faces against a wire-mesh internal barrier. They are nearly all Pakistani Christians. For one hour a day, some of the 200 asylum seekers held here are let out of their cells to see visitors. The men are semi-naked. Unaware we are BBC journalists, they tell us it's the only way to keep cool in the overcrowded cells they're kept in. The women cradle their children and babies. Many complain their children are suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting because of poor sanitation and dirty drinking water. The room gets noisy as the inmates cry out to the visiting charity workers for their help to get released, but food and clean drinking water are all they can offer. One mother tells me she has been here for three months with her children. ""The youngest is three and the eldest is 10. They are finding it very difficult being here, they are getting so ill,"" she says.The Thai government says parents ""often choose to have their children with them while in detention"". Yet the country has signed up to a number of UN international laws governing the humane treatment of prisoners and outlawing the imprisonment of children - particularly in centres holding adults. None of the detainees I speak to have received legal assistance from the UNHCR since their arrest.""We have no faith in the United Nations,"" 19-year-old Nazeem tells me, as she holds on to her baby cousin. ""We only have faith in God. He will bring us freedom.""Their only way out of detention is for local charities to request bail from the Thai authorities. It costs about £900 ($1,250) to release one person, so they do this only for those deemed most vulnerable. There are no official figures for the numbers arrested, but campaigners say it amounts to hundreds every month. It's alleged that 132 Pakistani Christians were arrested on one day alone in March last year. Altogether there are an estimated 11,500 Pakistani asylum seekers in Thailand, more than from any other country except Myanmar.Suddenly I come across a young woman I was hoping to meet. There on the other side of the security cordon is Laila, Sabir's wife. It's an emotional meeting - she is obviously desperate to see her family. ""I miss them, bring my daughters here so I can see their faces,"" she pleads. But the only way she is likely to see children for the foreseeable future, is if they are arrested too. In its statement to the BBC, the UNHCR says it is working with the Thai government to find a solution. ""Better and more humane management of the situation must be found in accordance with international legal norms,"" it says. The Thai government insists that it strives ""to provide the best possible care… based on international humanitarian principles.""Yet it inflicts an even worse fate upon some Pakistani Christians and their children. Those who are unable to pay the 4,000 Baht fine after they are arrested are thrown into one of Thailand's notorious jails.This happened last year to a group of 20 Pakistani men, women and children. Separated from the women, the men's heads were shaved, and their ankles and hands placed in shackles.""We had a lot of problem sleeping, sitting, standing up and walking,"" says one. ""The chains weighed about 4kg or 4.5kg, and we used to have injuries on our ankles. We were in a lot of pain. It was very difficult for us.""One of his cellmates, Daniel, bursts into tears when he describes how the men were searched. ""All we had to wear for clothing was a small piece of cloth,"" he adds.The people charged with assuring the protection of these UN-registered asylum seekers were nowhere to be seen.It was a local missionary who eventually bought their freedom.But remarkably, Daniel is still able to invoke his faith's humility and forgiveness.""Jesus said to us, 'If someone troubles you, don't ask for curses for him, instead, you should ask for blessings for him.' So, we ask for blessings for the UNHCR.""Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox."
886,'Missing' Thailand backpacker Grace Taylor flies to UK,"A British backpacker who was reported missing in Thailand has returned home. Grace Taylor, 21, from Swanage, Dorset, flew back to the UK on Tuesday night, police said.Officers at Krabi Airport said they approached Ms Taylor on Tuesday, who seemed ""extremely disturbed"" and refused to talk to the authorities. A Facebook plea to find Ms Taylor posted by her mother, Sam, sparked a global social media campaign for information about her daughter.Airport police said they approached the backpacker on Tuesday, who was ""constantly blowing a whistle and refusing to talk to anyone"". On Tuesday, Dorset Police said it had been contacted by Interpol to confirm she had been found.Miss Taylor's family filed a missing persons report with police on 21 February after she could had not been in contact with the UK for five days. On Monday, she called her mother from Ao Nang, who booked her a flight which she did not get on. This led to her mum writing on Facebook that the family were ""desperately worried"".According to the Facebook post, Miss Taylor was ""disoriented"" and ""not in a good mental state"". Miss Taylor's mum confirmed on Tuesday afternoon that the backpacker had been found. "
887,Thai murder: David Miller died from head injuries,"A British student murdered in Thailand died from severe head injuries, a coroner has concluded.The bodies of David Miller, 24, from Jersey and Hannah Witheridge, 23, from Norfolk, were found on a beach on Koh Tao in September 2014.Burmese migrants Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were convicted of the murders and sentenced to death in December.Jersey Coroner Mark Harris recorded a narrative verdict after outlining the murder case in Thailand.Earlier this month, Norfolk's coroner ruled Ms Witheridge was unlawfully killed.Mr Miller's mother Sue said after the inquest in St Helier: ""We kept in contact with Dave via Skype during his time in Australia and Thailand. ""His last call was on Skype from Koh Tao hours before his death. He described the island as paradise and showed us the view from his balcony using his phone and said he was going snorkelling that day. ""We're so grateful for that last contact. I heard the news about the deaths on the radio. No names were mentioned but I knew it was Dave.

888,"Thai princess leaves $40,000 custom toilet 'unused'","A toilet that cost an estimated $40,000 (£28,300) to custom-build for a Thai princess visiting Cambodia was left unused, officials say.Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn reportedly just took photos of the toilet's building during her visit to Yeak Lom Lake, in north-east Cambodia.The toilet has now been removed and the hut will serve as a tourist office.The story made headlines in Cambodia, where fewer than 40% of people in rural areas have access to toilets.The toilet, housed in a specially constructed air-conditioned hut, was set up for Ms Sirindhorn two-hour visit to the north-eastern lake on Monday, reportedly at her request.""She [the Princess] did not go inside the bathroom, she just looked at it from outside and took some pictures,"" community leader Ven Churk told the AFP news agency.The price tag covers the cost of the whole building which, he says, has been given to the community to be used as a tourist office.It was paid for by the Thais, Cambodian officials added.The toilet's construction was carried out by the Siam Cement Group (SCG), a Thai construction giant partly owned by a company that manages the Thai royal family's assets and investments, local media reported.SCG could not be reached for comment."

891,Bangkok airport safety issues 'must be addressed',"The airline industry has called on the Thai government to address problems at the country's main airport in Bangkok. The International Air Transport Association (Iata) says Suvarnabhumi airport has inadequate capacity and substandard taxiways. The criticism follows safety warnings last year from another air industry organisation about Thailand's regulation and inspection of airlines.The government has set up two bodies to oversee airports and airlines.However, it has asked for more time to meet international standards.Suvarnabhumi airport was opened nearly ten years ago. It is Thailand's main international gateway but Iata says it is now operating beyond its capacity, and needs to be expanded. ""Aviation is critical to Thailand's economic success. It is the backbone of the tourism industry and provides critical global business links,"" Iata's director general Tony Tyler said in Bangkok. ""It is in jeopardy, however, unless key issues of safety, capacity and costs are addressed urgently."" The organisation urged the Thai authorities to fix the problem of 'soft spots' in poor quality tarmac at Suvarnabhumi airport, where airliners sometimes got stuck and had to be pulled out. Mr Tyler said a permanent solution was needed. ""There seems to be a constant resurfacing with a temporary patchwork of asphalt reinforcements. Frankly, that is not good enough. ""The runway and gate downtime that results from constantly fixing (and re-fixing) them is unacceptable. ""Moreover the situation is a safety risk. The extraordinary power that aircraft need to use around soft spots and extra-towing expose ground personnel, ground equipment and the aircraft to safety risks.He also highlighted the issue of lack of capacity at the airport. He said the Phase Two terminal expansion was badly needed and should be fast tracked. ""For runway capacity, immediate capacity increases can be achieved through addressing the ""soft spots"" issue which will allow existing capacity to be used fully. But a third runway will be needed eventually. So it is important that work and preparations for a three runway system continue,"" he added. Thailand is already struggling to address last year's warnings from the United Nation's International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), about a shortage of inspectors to check safety procedures among Thai airlines. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) subsequently downgraded its safety rating of Thailand's aviation authority, finding that Thailand did not comply with the ICAO's safety standards.Iata said it was ""deeply disappointing"" that the organisations had raised safety concerns about Thailand as a country.It said the oversight concerns raised in both the ICAO and the FAA reports should be addressed by the Thai government ""thoroughly and urgently"".The airport's operator, Airports of Thailand,  has said it has come up with several measures to improve the runways using concrete and expand capacity. These are awaiting government approval.""We have prepared short- to medium- and long-term plans to solve the problems,"" said Sirote Duangratana, general manager of Suvarnabhumi Airport."
892,Bangkok Erawan shrine bomb: Uighur suspects plead not guilty,"Two ethnic Uighur Chinese men have pleaded not guilty of involvement in the bombing of a shrine in Bangkok, in their first court appearance.Twenty people were killed when the bomb hit the Erawan shrine in the centre of the Thai capital on 17 August. Yusufu Mieraili and Adem Karadag, also known as Bilal Mohammed, face charges of murder and possessing explosives.No group has ever admitted being behind the bombing, which also injured scores of people. Police say the men, both from the Xinjiang region of China, initially admitted carrying out the attack. Mr Karadag is accused of placing the bomb inside the Hindu shrine in a backpack.But his lawyer has alleged his client was tortured into confessing and is innocent of all charges except one of entering the country illegally. Prosecutors say Mr Mieraili delivered the backpack containing the bomb to another man.On arriving at court, he said he was ""an innocent Muslim"" who had already been detained for six months.Both men arrived at court shackled and with bare feet.Police chief Chakthip Chaijinda said the men had a right to retract their confession, but ""we have witnesses and clear evidence to prosecute them"", AFP reports.The Thai military government says it suspects a people-smuggling gang angered by a crackdown on its activities carried out the attack.  But many observers believe the attack was in fact carried out in retaliation for the forced repatriation from Thailand last July of more than 100 Uighur asylum seekers back to China.Fifteen suspects for whom the police issued arrest warrants are still at large."
